    "text": "Add the Government Accountability Office to the long list of federal agencies investigating the people and groups that surrounded President Trump in the months before he took office in January. The Capitol Hill spending watchdog has agreed to a request from Democratic lawmakers to look into the way the president’s transition team spent federal funds appropriated to ensure a smooth handover between the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nThe decision to have the transition team rent office and event space from businesses owned by the Trump Organization caused many ethics experts to express concern about potential ethical violations. At the time, a Trump spokesman said that none of the money appropriated by Congress would go to Trump organizations. (The transition team was also allowed to accept private donations.)\n\nRelated: Trump Hands Democrats Another Reason to Shut Down the Government\n\nThe team also raised eyebrows with the unorthodox way that it facilitated contact between Trump and foreign officials.\n\nThe review was launched at the request of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) back in November. In their request, they said, “We are writing today to request that the GAO conduct a review of President-Elect Trump's taxpayer-funded transition. We are concerned about reports of ‘disarray’ within a ‘chaotic’ transition, and ask that your review address several concerns, including conflicts of interest related to business holdings of Mr. Trump and his family; potential violations of protocol and security precautions related to Mr. Trump's communications with foreign leaders; and transparency related to the use of taxpayer funds in the transition.”\n\nThe GAO, last week, responded with a letter confirming that it had accepted the request and would work toward producing a preliminary report on its findings by June.\n\nAmong the areas that the agency proposes to explore:\n\nWhat laws guide the transition process, who enforces them and what “ethics-related provisions” apply to members of a presidential transition team?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the funds appropriated by Congress for the transition accounted for, and how was the money spent? How much private money did the transition accept?\n\n\n\n\n\nDid the transition team consult with the Office of Government Ethics or otherwise take advantage of its services in relation to identifying conflicts of interest and facilitating financial disclosures? How did that compare to previous transitions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, GAO will ask, “What information and services related to communication with heads of foreign governments were made available to the President- and Vice President-Elect and transition team? What is known about the transition teams use of services and how do the information and services provided for the 2017 transition compare to the 2009 and 2001 transitions?”\n\nRelated: Team Trump’s New Mission — The Most Ambitious Government Overhaul Ever\n\nThe White House has not yet commented on the new probe, which comes at the same time that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and at least two separate Congressional committees are investigating the activities of Trump and his associates during the 2016 election and afterward."

    "text": "When Donald Trump promised not touch Social Security and Medicare -- the two most expensive items on the federal budget -- but to go after waste, fraud, and abuse, it was obvious he would try to streamline the federal workforce to ensure that every job was necessary to meet the mission of each agency and program.\n\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney formally lifted President Trump’s 90-day federal hiring freeze on Wednesday, while mandating department and agency heads to begin thinking about ways to reorganize the federal bureaucracy to achieve billions of dollars in savings in the coming years.\n\nAlthough the young Trump administration has yet to show an aptitude for strategic, long-term thinking – especially in Syria and the Middle East -- Mulvaney is promising to remold the federal workforce and start from scratch.\n\nRelated: Budget Chief Admits Trump Can’t Wipe Out $20 Trillion in Debt in 8 Years\n\n“The executive branch of government has never been rebuilt,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “It has grown organically over the course of the last 240 years. The President of the United States has asked all of us in the executive branch to start from scratch. A literal blank piece of paper, and say, ‘If you were going to rebuild the executive branch, what would it look like?”\n\nMulvaney didn’t hazard a guess as to what a futuristic federal workforce would look like, exactly, other than to say it would be a big part of Trump’s call for “draining the swamp” and initially at least would mimic the spending priorities spelled out in the president’s recent budget submission to Congress for fiscal 2017 and 2018.\n\nIf that’s the case, then it’s a good bet a reconstituted bureaucracy would be top heavy with civilian workers at the Pentagon, the VA and Department of Homeland Security, which all got major spending boosts for the coming years. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the State Department and other agencies whose past policies ran afoul of Trump’s vision for America would most likely be scaled back.\n\nAnother concern is how Mulvaney’s efforts dovetail with those of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a former real estate and media executive who is heading up a new White House office of American Innovation in the West Wing. Kushner has assembled a team of strategic consultants and former business executives to generate fresh thinking in government and eliminate wasteful or duplicative programs.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nPresumably, Mulvaney and Kushner are working in concert, yet the potential for overlapping efforts and tension are great. Moreover, there are numerous political and legal obstacles to any major overhaul and downsizing effort, as previous administrations have discovered.\n\nMax Stier, an authority on the federal workforce, said in an interview that the Trump administration might be on the right track if they approach reforms as a way of re-aligning government services to the president’s policies, and not as an excuse for slashing the size of government.\n\n“That’s the big question in my mind,” said Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, a federal government advocacy group. “If the goal is to downsize, then it’s a mistake. If the goal is to align your human resources against your priorities and it as efficient as possible, then it’s hard to argue with. It’s the right thing to do, and ought to be done on a regular basis.”\n\nAll this activity stems from Trump’s Jan. 23 executive order imposing the temporary hiring freeze and calling for long-term planning to overhaul and downsize the federal government.\n\n\n\nRelated: Team Trump Wants to Sell Unused Federal Buildings, But it Won’t Be Easy\n\nHowever, with the exception of substantial shrinkage during the Clinton administration, the size of the civilian workforce is around 2.8 million. Technological advancements should have replaced a vast number of clerical and administrative workers. In addition to its full-time workforce, the federal government paid close to $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015.\n\nMulvaney was careful not to say yesterday how much lower the workforce number would go. He also had nothing to say about the mushrooming of private contract employees who constitute a shadow government of sorts, at a great cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe federal government is largely funded by Congress through annual appropriations bills, and lawmakers on key committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction over agencies and programs can block spending cuts and reorganization efforts they disagree with.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) already have raised objections to some of Trump’s proposed spending cuts. And many Democratic lawmakers are likely to object to steep cutbacks in the ranks of federal workers – including many who are constituents.\n\nRelated: The Federal Government Really Does Need an Overhaul: Can Trump Get It Done?\n\nStier stressed that Congress would have a lot to say about the ultimate success or failure of the Trump workforce initiatives. “You can’t dance alone on this,” he said. “You’ve got to have Congress involved from the get-go. Not only do they make the budgets themselves and appropriate the money, but they also are fundamental to most consequential changes you might want to implement.”\n\nAlso, the new administration must cope with a maze of federal civil service rules that greatly complicate efforts to downsize agencies through a reduction in force (RIFs), firing and retirement.\n\nRobert Shea, a former OMB executive during the administration of George W. Bush, told Federal News Radio that Mulvaney was undertaking a herculean effort to integrate all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies.\n\n“If they try to do that, they’ll fail,” said Shea, now a principal with Grant Thornton. “If they break it into manageable parts, it might not just be the most ambitious reorganization in the last 20 years or more; it could also be the most successful.”"

    "text": "Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent critic of President Trump but a supporter of his strike last week against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, said on Tuesday that barrel bombs should be the new “red line” in Syria.\n\n“Here’s what I would tell President Trump,” the South Carolina Republican said in a CNN interview. “You did a great thing by enforcing the chemical weapons violation. But it's not about how you killed the babies; it's the fact that you're slaughtering innocent people through air power.”\n\nRelated: Will Trump’s $600M Fighter Plane Sale to Nigeria Mean More Civilian Deaths?\n\nGraham’s comments came on the heels of remarks made by Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday in which he said at the daily press briefing: \"If you gas a baby… if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president.\"\n\nSpicer, under heavy fire on Wednesday for blunders about Hitler and his use of deadly gas, walked back his barrel bomb comment a few hours after he made it. In a statement, he said, \"The president retains the option to act in Syria against the Assad regime whenever it is in the national interest, as was determined following that government's use of chemical weapons against its own citizens. And as the President has repeatedly made clear, he will not be telegraphing his military responses.\"\n\nWhat exactly is a barrel bomb?\n\nFirst said to be used by Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and later dropped by the U.S. on the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, barrel bombs are crude but deadly devices similar to the IEDs (improvised explosive devices) used in Iraq and Afghanistan against allied forces.\n\nFins are welded onto metal containers, usually 55-gallon oil drums, which are fitted with an impact fuse that goes off when it strikes the ground. The drums are filled with explosives and pieces of metal such as nuts, bolts and nails and dropped on enemy positions from helicopters or planes.\n\nThe unguided bombs are indiscriminate weapons that explode on impact and can kill or wound anyone within the range of the flying metal.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nBut barrel bombs, which can be constructed for a few hundred dollars, can contain lethal material other than metal shards.

    "text": "Since 9/11, almost as many Americans have died at the hands of far-right-wing extremists as have been killed by radical Islamists – 106 and 119, respectively – a new report by the nonpartisan Government Accounting Office shows.\n\nThe GAO also said that despite more than $50 million being spent by the Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2016 to counter the growth of violent extremism in the U.S., there is no mechanism in place to measure whether efforts apart from surveillance and law enforcement have been effective.\n\nRelated: Main Suspect in Stockholm Truck Attack Admits to Terrorist Crime\n\nOf the 85 violent extremist attacks since Sept. 12, 2001, which resulted in 225 deaths, 62 – or 73 percent – were by far-right groups or individuals, the GAO report says.\n\nWhile more of the 225 deaths were attributed to radical Islamists, the GAO said that 41 percent of those killings happened in a single incident, the 2016 attack on a club in Orlando. The shootings at the Pulse nightclub left 49 dead and 53 wounded.\n\nThe sole perpetrator of the Pulse attack – the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history – was an American-born security guard of Afghani origins named Omar Mateen who is said to have pledged his allegiance to ISIS. But some reports have said Mateen was seen at the largely gay club on many occasions and have suggested that the incident may also have been a hate crime. Still, mass murder is the signature of radical Islamist terrorism.\n\nAlso tagged as the work of radical Islamists were the 2002 “Beltway Sniper” shootings in which 10 people were shot to death in Washington, Virginia and Maryland, though the motives of the main killer remain murky. What is not measured in the report can terrorize people and have a long-lasting impact on society, even though it might not have resulted in a multitude of deaths. That would include the Boston Marathon bombing, where three people died, and 16 people lost their limbs.\n\nRelated: Trump Says ‘Thousands of Shooters’ Like Orlando Terrorist Are in the US Already\n\nThe GAO defines violent extremism as “ideologically, religious, or politically- motivated acts of violence” that have been “perpetrated in the United States by white supremacists, anti-government groups, and radical Islamist entities, among others.”\n\nIn 2011, the government set out to devise strategies that would “address the conditions and reduce the factors that most likely contribute to recruitment and radicalization by violent extremists” of any stripe. Some 44 tasks for countering violent extremism (CVE) were set, centering on community outreach, blunting recruitment messages and supporting local efforts to identify and counsel people at risk of being radicalized.\n\nWhile about half of those tasks have been completed, another half are in progress, including “DHS building relationships with the social media industry and increasing training available to communities to counter violent extremists online.” Tasks not yet addressed include “implementing CVE activities in prisons and learning from former violent extremists.”\n\nHowever, the report said that Washington has no mechanism for figuring out whether such attempts efforts at CVE have been effective.\n\nRelated: We Won’t Ever Stop Terrorism, but Let’s Be Honest About How to Reduce It\n\n“We tried but were unable to come up with CVE funding levels. That’s largely because agencies have been using existing programs to address CVE goals. For example, programs or portions of programs to address violence in schools could be relevant to CVE, but you can’t specifically break out the ‘CVE only’ portion,” Diana Maurer, director of the GAO’s Homeland Security and Justice Team, said in an email\n\nBecause of that, the GAO report said it “was not able to determine if the United States is better off today than it was in 2011” in fighting back against the radicalization of individuals.\n\nIn 2016, $51.3 million was allocated for countering violent extremism by DHS, but there are no hard numbers for how much in total has been spent by all agencies in the years since the goals were set.\n\nBroadly speaking though, Maurer said, it is fair to say that funding for federal CVE efforts to educate and prevent criminal or terrorist acts before they happen “is substantially less than the billions spent each year on federal efforts to counter or combat terrorism” by collecting evidence and making arrests. “GAO does not have a position on the relative allocation of resources, nor do we have a complete figure for the costs of combating terrorism,” she said."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/12/Why-Your-Choice-Network-Doctors-Could-Get-Smaller-2018",
    "text": "Americans who get their health insurance through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act may have more difficulty finding a doctor next year, but it won’t necessarily have anything to do with insurers leaving the system. It could be because the Trump administration earlier this year quietly announced that it is dropping federal review of something called “network adequacy” in deference to state regulators.\n\nWhen implementation of the ACA began in 2014, health care researchers immediately noticed that the insurers offering plans on the exchanges were pursuing what they called a “narrow network” strategy. That meant that they were keeping the web of care and service providers considered “in-network” as small as possible to lower costs.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nThe law requires insurers who want to sell their policies through the exchanges to “maintain a network that is sufficient in number and types of providers, including providers that specialize in mental health and substance use disorder services, to assure that all services will be accessible to enrollees without unreasonable delay.”\n\nThe Obama administration, over the next few years, found that insurers were not always complying with those requirements — at least not in a way that the administration believed the law intended — and began placing new requirements on them. Among other things, the Obama Department of Health and Human Services worked up a requirement under which medical professionals in particular fields had to be within specific geographic range of 90 percent of the people covered by a qualifying plan.\n\nIn a Federal Register filing in February, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that determinations of network adequacy would be left to the states going forward. States that don’t have the capacity to set network adequacy on their own would be expected to revert to the standard used in 2014, before the Obama administration added additional requirements.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would ‘Devastate’ Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nHealth care experts have expressed concern that the reduced level of federal scrutiny will create an atmosphere in which insurers can continue to narrow their networks.\n\n“While the future of the ACA’s marketplaces remains uncertain, insurers are likely to continue to push the envelope towards narrower provider networks in order to deliver more competitive premiums for consumers,” wrote Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. “And while many consumers have shown willingness to trade a broad choice of providers for a lower price, overly narrow networks could impinge on their ability to access care in a timely way.”\n\nWhile some states have the capacity to police insurance companies to assure that coverage is accessible to consumers, Corlette warned, not all of them do.\n\nRelated: Can Trump and Dems Find Common Ground on Health Care?\n\n“Some states do not conduct network adequacy reviews; in these states, [the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight] has done them. It remains to be seen, in the absence of federal oversight, whether these states will have the capacity or willingness to take on a more expanded role. Accreditation alone will not assure that consumers have access to plans with adequate provider networks.”"

    "text": "If you're like most middle-class Americans, you're probably feeling frustrated right now.\n\nDemocrats are still in a post-election funk, shocked that President Donald Trump is in the White House and, based on the findings of the University of Michigan sentiment survey, bracing for a new economic recession. Republicans are no doubt frustrated by a lack of progress on health care and tax reform, apparent infighting in the West Wing and, for many Trump supporters, the specter of another round of foreign policy adventures.\n\nAbove it all, workers of all political stripes must be frustrated by the fact that the economic expansion has yet to deliver the kind of wage gains that have been long promised. That, to individual Americans, is the ultimate measure of whether the economy is \"good\" or not. Despite an unemployment rate that has fallen to just 4.5 percent (lowest since May 2007), wage gains remain lukewarm.\n\nRelated: How Much Money It Takes to Be in the Top 1% In Every State\n\nNo wonder the post-election ebullience hasn't translated into \"hard data\" gains in terms of things like auto sales or GDP growth. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow real-time estimate of first-quarter growth stands at just 0.6 percent.\n\nWhat, exactly, is it going to take to get take-home pay moving higher?\n\nDeutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna says the problem is that ongoing labor market slack may not be fully captured by the data. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen echoed this sentiment in a speech in Michigan on Monday, noting that the decline in the labor participation rate might be a hidden unemployment measure since these folks could, conceivably, reenter the workforce once they see upward pressure on wages.\n\nThus, LaVorgna believes the unemployment rate will need to fall even further to get wages to move meaningfully. Back in 2007, when the unemployment rate was last at current levels, average hourly earnings were growing at a 3.5 percent annual pace, compared to just 2.7 percent now. Moreover, the current pace represents a slight decline from this cycle's peak wage growth of 2.9 percent seen in December.\n\nRelated: The Most Overpaid CEO in America\n\nOne clue to the lingering labor market slack could be the broader U-6 measure of unemployment, which includes those working part-time but desiring full-time work as well as other marginally attached workers. This unemployment rate stands at 8.9 percent now vs. 8.2 percent in May 2007.\n\nUS Unemployment Rate data by YCharts\n\nFinally, the lack of labor productivity growth means that businesses are resisting wage gains as much as possible right now in an effort to protect profit margins. Economy-wide measures of corporate profits have stalled over the past couple of years, forcing company executives to get increasingly creative with their accounting trickery — via pro forma \"adjusted\" earnings — to meet Wall Street's quarterly expectations game.\n\nRelated: The Bull Market’s Big Challenge — Corporate Profits Have Stalled\n\nOver the last five years, nonfarm business productivity has grown at just a 0.7 percent annualized rate — the weakest performance since 1982. Compare this to the 2.2 percent annualized rate posted in the five years ending in 2007.\n\nThinking optimistically, here's how things need to play out: LaVorgna believes the narrow U-3 unemployment rate will need to fall to 4 percent or below for average hourly earnings growth to accelerate to the 3 percent to 4 percent range, where most American workers would finally start to feel good about their income gains. Productivity growth would likely follow, since businesses would be forced to invest in labor-saving technology to minimize the hit to the expense line."

    "text": "If ever there was a campaign promise that rang bogus from the start, it was President Trump’s vow to wipe out the entire national debt – now inching close to $20 trillion – within eight years.\n\nTrump made that promise last April during a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. When pressed by the reporters to explain how he would manage such a feat, Trump suggested he could retire the massive debt load in eight years through a series of unspecified spending cuts and renegotiated trade deals.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Fiscal Fantasy Eliminates $20 Trillion of National Debt in 8 Years\n\nTrump might have been better off simply promising to slow the rate of growth of government spending and borrowing – a noble goal in the eyes of many deficit hawks and fiscal conservatives. Even that would have been difficult for Trump to promise considering his other campaign pledges to bulk up the military, slash corporate and individual tax rates and launch a $1 trillion infrastructure program.\n\nInstead, Trump insisted that he could wipe out the national debt by the end of his second term – prompting many people familiar with government spending and borrowing policies to conclude that that Republican presidential frontrunner was utterly delusional.\n\nIn an interview today with John Harwood of CNBC, Trump’s White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, acknowledged that the president had gotten carried away and set a goal that is simply out of reach.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\n“It's fairly safe to assume that was hyperbole,” said Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). “I'm not going to be able to pay off $20 trillion worth of debt in four years. I'd be being dishonest with you if I said that I could.”\n\nMulvaney, who is in the throes of negotiating a new budget with congressional Republican leaders and the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that any major initiative to downsize the debt at this point would entail sharp reductions in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs. Trump isn’t prepared to undertake so politically risky a drive.\n\n“The reason the president doesn't want to change some of the mandatory spending, is because the public's not ready for it yet,” Mulvaney said. “They're ready for economic growth.”"

    "text": "A new demand from the White House may have dashed any hope for a bipartisan compromise to avoid another government shutdown at the end of this month.\n\nThe federal government's current temporary spending authority expires on April 28, and budget experts were never completely convinced that the effort to authorize continued spending would go off without some faction in Congress trying to attach a highly partisan rider to the must-pass legislation. Spending fights like this one always magnify the leverage of groups in Congress, like the House Freedom Caucus, who are willing to incur the anger of their colleagues and much of the country to press for changes on issues important to them.\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nPolitico reported that it might be the Trump administration that throws sand in the gears this time around. The website reported Wednesday morning that Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, is telling GOP lawmakers that the administration wants a rider added to the spending bill that would bar federal funding from flowing to so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nSanctuary cities are loosely defined as municipalities that don’t fully cooperate with federal authorities to enforce immigration law. Policies differ from city to city, but typically they encourage undocumented immigrants to report crimes without fear that they will be handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In New York City, those crimes might include acts of terror. Some refuse to hold undocumented immigrants who are arrested until they can be picked up by immigration officials or even to report that they have an undocumented person in custody in the first place.\n\nTrump has been particularly incensed by sanctuary cities since the beginning of his presidential campaign in 2015 and has repeatedly called for federal funding to be withheld from them as punishment. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that states and municipalities that fail to demonstrate compliance with federal requests for assistance in immigration cases would be ineligible for grants from the Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs.\n\nMulvaney’s demand, though, goes considerably further than that, Politico says, encompassing a much wider range of programs.\n\nRelated: The Clock Is Ticking on a Government Shutdown — 5 Things You Need to Know\n\nIf Republicans block federal funding to sanctuary cities, most of which tend to be heavily Democratic, the prospects of bipartisan cooperation on the bill would most likely dry up instantly.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, represents a district wholly within the sanctuary city San Francisco. She and fellow Democrats who support large urban areas would never get behind a bill with a funding ban that hit their constituencies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, likewise, comes from New York, which is also a sanctuary city. In the Senate, the Republicans will need to assemble 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, and Schumer wouldn’t be inclined to help find them for a bill shutting off funds to major cities.\n\nThe pressure from the White House to include the rider, while plainly in line with Trump’s view of how sanctuary cities ought to be treated, may also be an effort to bring the Freedom Caucus on board with the rest of the Republicans in the House GOP conference when it comes to the spending bill, something that would allow the GOP to pass it without any Democratic votes.\n\nThe roughly three-dozen-strong Freedom Caucus, if it withholds its support, can deprive Republican leadership of a majority of floor votes if Democrats refuse to cooperate.\n\nRelated: How Trump's Latest Twitter Tantrum Could Shut Down the Government\n\nWhether a sanctuary city’s rider would be enough to get Freedom Caucus support is unclear. The members — from some of the most conservative districts in the country — have in the past tried to add other hot-button issues to must-pass legislation, including the defunding of both the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus also has a history, as the White House learned during the effort to pass the American Health Care Act last month, of taking whatever more moderate Republicans will give them — and then asking for more."

Desperate veterans were put on hold and given a recorded message that said if they were “having thoughts of suicide” to hang up and dial a 1-800 number, according to Scott Blackburn, interim deputy secretary at the VA. Many just hung up.\n\nThe Veterans Affairs Department’s much-derided suicide hotline goal was to have no more than 10 percent of calls routed to overflow can centers. Yet as of last November, the rate was nearly 30 percent the Inspector General for the VA reported.\n\nRelated: The $92 Billion VA Still Doesn't Have Its Act Together\n\nIn March, the IG issued a report which found that needed improvements to the emergency hotline for had not been made and that many veterans who called the hotline seeking assistance were being routed to overflow call centers. Some were being placed in a line for up to a half hour waiting for their call to be answered.\n\nThat situation was “unacceptable,” Blackburn said last week at ACT-IAC’s Customer Experience Summit, according to Nextgov.com. At a time when the VA was still reeling from a scandal in which hundreds of veterans had died waiting for medical treatment at VA medical centers, fixing the problem with the hotline became the primary objective.\n\nWith former VA secretary Robert McDonald at the helm, the long waits gradually abated. Today, veterans who call in search of the VA crisis line are greeted with a message to “press 7” to connect with the line. And the tweaks and other improvements have reduced the rollover rate to less than one percent, he said.\n\nRelated: VA Hospitals Struggle With a Growing Problem: Drug Theft by Employees\n\nThe Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) was established in 2007 and answers roughly 500,000 calls a year. The hotline has surged in popularity and use, which prompted the VA to open a second crisis hub in Atlanta to go along with the one in New York.\n\n“We realized demand jump,” Blackburn said. “It’s great because we’re helping more people but it was bad because we weren’t ready to handle that volume. That’s quite a transformation, and this is happening very much in real time.”"

    "text": "Investors beware: there are four reasons (at least) why tax reform may not happen this year.\n\n1) Democrats have been told it’s “us vs. them” and to obstruct any and all Republican initiatives.\n\n2) There is only one individual in the White House with any tax policy credentials, but there are many loud voices.\n\n3) The failure to pass Paul Ryan’s healthcare bill makes it harder to enact tax reform through reconciliation.\n\n4) The House and the Senate disagree on the way forward.\n\nTaking these points in order, we note first that the solid resistance from Democrats in Congress means that wide-ranging tax reform will have to proceed along party lines. The Left, enabled by groups like We Will Replace You, is threatening to mount a primary challenge to any Democrat that “colludes” with Trump…on anything.\n\nRelated: Think Trump Will Make Your Taxes Easier Next Year? Don’t Get Your Hopes Up\n\nConsequently, some think Republicans should attempt a more limited tax overhaul, in hopes that it could attract some Democrat supporters. For example, they propose combining a one-time opportunity for U.S. firms to bring home profits stashed overseas, paying only a modest tax, with an infrastructure program.\n\nAn estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates at least $2.6 trillion is held overseas by U.S. firms. If a 10 percent “repatriation” tax was levied on those funds, the Treasury would collect a $260 billion windfall. Those revenues could provide funding for a private-public program to rebuild our tunnels and airports. That popular idea would be tough for Democrats to resist.\n\nThe repatriation opportunity received bipartisan encouragement in the past, but that was then. There’s no assurance Dems would go along, and in any case, the GOP wants more than a quick fix to our dysfunctional 75,000-page tax code; they want to “go big.” They campaigned on lower taxes for individuals, not just corporations, and they need to deliver.\n\nAs a result, Republicans will try to pass broad tax reform as part of the budget – a process called “reconciliation.” The trick here is that they must follow the so-called “Byrd” rule governing that approach, and come up with a plan that is “revenue neutral for ten years and beyond.” Trump and his team want to slash individual and corporate tax rates; policy makers need to find extra revenues to avoid blowing up the deficit. Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady’s solution is the border adjustment tax (BAT), which aims to encourage exports.\n\nRelated: The Fed, the Reality of Tax Cuts, and Donald Trump\n\nThat idea has not won the backing of the White House. Trump initially called it “too complicated;” members of his economic team are searching for alternatives. Gary Cohn, who is White House Economic Council Director, has apparently taken the lead in this pursuit, even though the former Goldman Sachs president is new to tax policy. He reportedly suggested a carbon tax to balance the books, but that idea was almost immediately shot down. (He has since denied that he considered such a levy.)\n\nOther administration players reportedly weighing in on tax strategy include National Economic Council member Shahira Knight, Steven Mnuchin and his Treasury colleagues Craig Phillips and Justin Muzinich as well as advisors Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. Only Knight, a former lobbyist for Fidelity Investments, is a tax policy wonk. Others are still early on the learning curve.\n\nComplicating the consensus-building at the White House is a profound split in ideology. Gary Cohn, Mnuchin and Phillips lean left; all have contributed to Democrats, and their take on tax reform (and everything else) is viewed with suspicion by their Republican colleagues.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP tax architects were dealt a heavy blow when the Freedom Caucus nuked the healthcare plan. Contained in the AHCA was a trillion-dollar tax cut. That was the total amount, stretched over a decade, expected to be saved by rolling back the different fees and levies contained in Obamacare. (Apparently the Freedom Caucus didn’t get that memo.)\n\nSince that trillion-dollar cut to taxes did not come through, cutting tax rates will result in considerably higher lost revenues. The quest for a balancing mechanism becomes even tougher.\n\nRelated: Trump Team Could Pull the Plug on Obamacare Subsidies for 2018\n\nBrady’s BAT, which would slap a 20 percent tax on imports, creates winner and losers and is therefore controversial. Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers, is running an ad campaign opposing the BAT focused on how the levy might drive up the cost of living. It fails to mention that lower tax rates are expected to offset higher consumer prices, or that some expect currency values to adjust for the import fee. It powerfully warns the tax will harm lower and middle-income Americans.\n\nGeorgia’s David Perdue picks up that refrain and is a leading critic of Brady’s approach in the Senate. Formerly the CEO of a discount retail chain, Perdue wrote in a letter in February, \"this 20-percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, and shuts down economic growth.\" Tom Cotton of Arkansas, home to Walmart, also opposes the measure, which is considered damaging to retailers.\n\nAssuming the border tax fails, Republicans need to either find another revenue source or change the rules governing reconciliation. The latter is more probable. They can move the goalposts; instead of “ten years and beyond,” they can determine that any change will not increase the deficit over 15 years, or 20. In 2001, Congress changed the window from 5 years to 10, because legislators didn’t want the Bush tax cuts to expire after only five years.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Tax Plan Could Affect Your Social Security\n\nTax reformers can argue that if the goal is to entice companies to make long-lasting investments in the U.S., the changes should extend beyond a decade. Extending the timeframe would also accomplish this: now that the CBO is allowed to use dynamic scoring, it can project growth from tax cuts extending farther into the future. This will help portray tax reform as revenue neutral.\n\nThis is where we are. It isn’t pretty. The central players in this drama confront numerous obstacles, including many of their own making. They will get it done, but those working behind the scenes now see success at best by the end of this year. Beyond that, voters will run out of patience, markets could falter, and the GOP could take a serious licking in the midterm elections."

    "text": "The Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday seemed to walk back a promise that the Trump administration would continue paying health insurance subsidies that insurance companies serving the individual market through the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges rely on to balance the cost of serving patients that consumer a large amount of healthcare.\n\nThe administration, in a statement to The New York Times on Monday, had said that the plan was to continue paying the subsidies while courts adjudicate the claim, brought by Republicans in Congress, that the payments are illegal because they were not specifically authorized by the law.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nAs insurers try to determine whether they will participate in the exchanges next year, many were calling on the administration to provide some certainty about the subsidies -- something HHS appeared to do in a statement provided to the Times.\n\n“The precedent is that while the lawsuit is being litigated, the cost-sharing subsidies will be funded,” the agency told the newspaper. “It would be fair for you to report that there has been no policy change in the current administration.”\n\nHowever, on Tuesday afternoon, Vox Media’s Sarah Kliff reported that she had received a statement from HHS that challenged the Times report.\n\n“The New York Times report is inaccurate,” said the statement, attributed to HHS spokesperson Alleigh Marré. “The administration is currently deciding its position on this matter. We have not been contacted by Democrats to help save Obamacare, perhaps because they consider Obamacare to be a losing cause. Democrats need to help solve this failed Obamacare plan. The report referred to the current status of the lawsuit and is not an indication of what will happen in the future. No decisions have been made about how the administration will proceed.”\n\nRelated: Insurer’s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We’re Out\n\nLate last month, House Speaker Paul Ryan had signaled that there would be no push from Congress to shut off the subsidies while the lawsuit was being resolved, a statement that the insurance industry saw as welcome but insufficient.\n\nWithout an ironclad guarantee that the subsidies would keep flowing, industry representatives said, insurers would be forced to raise premiums for the 2018 plan year to account for the uncertainty.\n\nWhile the HHS statement to the times on Monday appeared to be aimed at creating that certainty, the statement Tuesday afternoon seems likely to have the exact opposite effect."

    "text": "White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney is aggressively moving ahead with Trump Administration efforts to slash spending, improve efficiency and downsize the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAs early as Wednesday, Mulvaney’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is expected to send out a “guidance” letter to federal departments and agencies, instructing them to design plans to streamline their operations and cut costs.\n\nRelated: The Federal Government Really Does Need an Overhaul: Can Trump Get It Done?\n\nThe letter stems from President Trump’s March 13 executive order, which called for a “comprehensive plan for reorganizing the executive branch,” with an eye to presenting a formal plan to the Republican-controlled Congress within a year.\n\nWith Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner keenly focused on overhauling the federal bureaucracy and reducing government red tape, Mulvaney reportedly will be seeking proposals that eliminate redundant programs, implement best practices, and limit government waste. He’ll also try to sell federal property that no one uses, but that costs taxpayers a fortune to maintain.\n\nThat last idea – to unload surplus or underutilized federal buildings and land and funnel the profits into the federal coffers – has long been a dream of Republican and Democratic administration. Yet for decades the effort to shed surplus and abandoned real estate – both in civilian and military government – has proved to be an elusive goal.\n\nAnd for all the energy and determination that the former Tea Party conservative House member from South Carolina brings to his new job as budget czar, Mulvaney is likely to run into the same brick wall.\n\nRelated: Government Wastes More Money than You Think\n\nWith more than three billion square feet of real estate under its aegis, the federal government is far and away the largest landlord in the country. Much of that property – acquired over the years to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions -- is of little or no use to the government today. Yet Congress has appropriated billions of dollars over the years simply to preserve the unneeded and unwanted property that agencies can’t unload.\n\nIn fiscal 2010 – the last year for which accurate data is available – the government spent $1.67 billion operating and maintaining 295,000 underutilized or vacant buildings. The annual cost of preserving the surplus property has steadily added to the deficit.\n\nPresident Obama was the last chief executive to try to do something about the problem. He launched an effort in 2012 to reform federal real estate management practices, with an eye toward culling the stock of underutilized or surplus property.\n\nThe OMB later issued government-wide guidance – known as the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property – but ended up with relatively little to show for the effort.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe General Services Administration – which manages about 15 percent of federal government holdings -- insists that it has made important strides in recent years. Between fiscal 2011 and 2015, the agency said it disposed of 947 properties managed by both the GSA and other federal land-holding agencies that generated $289 million in proceeds.\n\nLast April, GSA sold the Metro West facility in downtown Baltimore for more than $7 million in a public property auction. The previous year, GSA sold the Federal Reserve Building in Seattle for $16 million at an online auction with eight bidders competing.\n\nWhile these and other transactions suggest progress, the proceeds from the sales are relatively paltry. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report last year that despite the best efforts of the Obama administration and some lawmakers, “significant challenges persist” for 23 government agencies and departments in managing their surplus real property.\n\n“Despite implementing policies and systems that may help federal agencies manage real property, the federal government continues to maintain too much excess and underutilized property,” Dave Wise, GAO’s Director of Physical Infrastructure, said in congressional testimony last year.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nIn the District of Columbia, for example, the old Cotton Annex, an 118,000-square-foot aging hulk located just two blocks from the National Mall, has been vacant since 2007. It has taken many years for the government to dispose of portions of the old St. Elizabeths mental hospital campus in Southeast Washington. And the GSA for years has left numerous vacant warehouses throughout the city.\n\nThese problems are duplicated in cities and states throughout the country. The Baltimore Sun reported in July 2013 that two years after the Obama administration had rebooted the government’s efforts to dispose of surplus federal buildings, almost all of the excess property identified in Maryland remained in government hands.\n\n“Red tape, lack of congressional action and inadequate funding have left federal agencies stuck with at least 200 vacant or underutilized properties in the state, from closet-size storage sheds in Beltsville to an eight-story, historic office building a block from Baltimore's Inner Harbor,” the newspaper reported.\n\nThere are no reliable figures for the total market value of vacant or underutilized federal property, although it is likely to be in the hundreds of billions. However, cashing in on that property is problematic at best. That’s because the GSA and other government agencies face numerous obstacles in disposing of federal property that a commercial realtor doesn’t routinely face.\n\nFor instance, there are legally prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete, according to GAO. This process includes requirements that the property is screened first for potential use by other federal agencies, then by homeless providers and state and local governments for other public uses.\n\nRelated: Congress to Pentagon: Don’t Even Think About Closing Military Bases\n\nAlso, aging government properties may not appeal to potential buyers or lessees if they require substantial repairs or environmental remediation – work that the federal government usually can’t afford to do in advance. The required environmental assessments and remediation can be highly expensive and time-consuming, a fact that often scares away would-be buyers.\n\nFinally, key stakeholders involved in the process – such as local governments, non-profit organizations, environmentalists, tribal governments and business—often fight over how best to dispose of the property.\n\nIn the case of the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans’ organizations frequently insist on being consulted on plans to reuse or demolish the VA’s historic buildings and how those plans impact the services provided to the nation’s veterans.\n\n“Final decisions about a property may reflect competing interests and broader stakeholder considerations that may not align with what an agency views as the most cost effective or efficient alternative for a property,” according to the GAO report.\n\nThe Trump administration could, of course, change those barriers to sale to save taxpayers money. If, for example, property has been on the market for 5 years, and no one has come forward to purchase it or tried to reconcile any dispute, then it could become a free and clear sale in accordance with the laws of the state.\n\nIf you want to see what the government is selling right now, including four Rolex watches, click on GSA Auctions."

    "text": "Having just engineered the induction of Neil Gorsuch as a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a conquering hero to conservative Republicans.\n\nA commentary on the “news site” of the right-wing Heritage Foundation said this morning, “Had McConnell not made the quick and decisive decision following [Justice Antonin] Scalia’s death to postpone any judicial confirmation hearings until after the 2016 presidential election thereby allowing the next president to appoint Scalia’s successor, it is very likely that now-President Donald Trump might still be citizen Trump.\n\n“If President Barack Obama’s choice, Judge Merrick Garland, had been given hearings and confirmed to the court, not only would Scalia’s seat have been lost—perhaps also would the very issue that propelled Trump to win last November.”\n\nRelated: McConnell Prepared to Invoke ‘Nuclear Option’ to Confirm Gorsuch\n\nPutting aside the unsubstantiated assertion that it was conservatives concerned about the direction of SCOTUS who catapulted Trump to the White House, it is clear that McConnell is feeling the conservative love.\n\nUnfortunately, those warm feelings toward the senior senator from Kentucky are not universally held – especially among his own constituents (though that presumably does not include his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao).\n\nMcConnell is the least liked senator in America, with 47 percent of Kentuckians giving him a thumbs-down according to a new Morning Consult poll of 85,000 registered voters. Still, he’s doing better than he was about six months ago when 51 percent withheld their approval.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of the loudest voices in the Senate pull the biggest negatives.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nIn South Carolina, 40 percent of voters have negative feelings about Republican Lindsey Graham, who along with pal Arizona GOP Senator John McCain, has been a frequent critic of Donald Trump (though both applauded the strike against Syria). McCain, a onetime presidential nominee, posts a 43 percent disapproval rating, just below McConnell and one click above Graham in the most disliked list.\n\nVoters in Massachusetts approved of another outspoken senator, progressive Elisabeth Warren, by 56 percent, but she also had high negatives at 38 percent. On the whole, though, Dems fared better than Republicans.\n\nIn fact, in the Top 10 list of senators with the highest disapproval ratings, there were 8 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Right, 8 and 5 don’t add up to 10. But there was 1 Republican tied with a Democrat for sixth place and three Republicans tied for seventh place.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Has a Plan to Save the Democratic Party\n\nOut of 100 senators, the one with the highest positive rating is neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent candidacy unsettled the race for the Democratic nomination won by now-defeated Hillary Clinton, is the most popular senator in America, with a home-state approval rating of 75 percent.\n\nAs for McConnell, as Genevieve Wood wrote in The Daily Signal, “So if you’re raising a glass to our new Supreme Court associate justice, raise one to McConnell as well.”\n\nOr not."

    "text": "Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake has enthusiastically taken up the mantle of former Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, whose annual “Wastebook” chronicled what he saw as profligate spending by the federal government. Flake, who publishes his own version of the book from his perch in the Senate, has also added companion volumes to the Wastebook, the most recent of which is the “Tax Rackets” report going after a handful of what he calls “outlandish loopholes to lower tax liabilities.”\n\nHowever, it’s difficult to know, sometimes, whether Flake’s real object with these publications is to root out wasteful government programs or to spin selectively chosen federal policies in the worst light possible, creating the impression that the government is a feckless steward of the public’s tax dollars.\n\nRelated: The Federal Spending ‘Wastebook’ Is Outrageous in More Ways Than One\n\nFlake, like Coburn before him, has a history of ridiculing scientific research grants without supplying any context about why the sometimes strange or obscure things they study might actually help advance larger efforts to cure diseases or solve environmental problems.\n\nHis last edition of the Wastebook identified some glaring examples of irresponsible federal spending. But it also spent pages and pages attacking government programs that it described in the worst possible light, frequently leaving out or downplaying information critical to understanding them.\n\nThe new Tax Rackets book is much the same. The first example identified is the “Alpaca Tax Fleece” in which people looking to reduce their tax liability in any given year can purchase any number of the South American-native creatures and immediately write off the entire cost. Flake’s staff identified some truly egregious abuse of the system by people who used the cost of the animals and their care to drive their taxable income to zero for years, and to claim large tracts of property as farmland, thereby greatly reducing property taxes.\n\nSeveral of the “loopholes” Flake identifies in the report are examples of businesses taking advantage -- in some cases to apparent excess -- of laws allowing municipalities to issue municipal bonds to help finance projects that have a private component. This includes things like public golf courses operated by a third-party contractor, or in one case, a massive mall in New Jersey. Municipal bonds typically carry lower rates because the payments to bondholders are sheltered from taxes.\n\nRelated: Grantees Say Sen. Jeff Flake’s ‘Waste Book’ a Waste of Taxpayer Money\n\nBut other things that come in for Flake’s ridicule are more of a stretch.\n\nThe book attacks the federal government for what it describes as a “Telemarketing Tax Break.”\n\n“As if telemarketers interrupting dinner or waking you from your sleep isn’t irritating enough, the tax code is providing a special telemarketing tax break for publishing companies to cover the costs of hiring more operators to call you.”\n\nHowever, the program being criticized is much broader than the headline would suggest and allows publishing companies to write off expenses related to the acquisition of new customers. That includes, but is not at all limited, to telemarketers.\n\nRelated: Think Trump Will Make Your Taxes Easier Next Year? Don’t Get Your Hopes Up\n\nThe book also goes into lengthy detail on what it calls the “Chicken Poop Tax Credit,” which goes to companies using biomass to create renewable energy with a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nThe “tax credits paid for the production of poultry poop power” as Flake puts it, are presented as though they could cost the Treasury $200 million per year. However, that figure is the total for the government’s entire open-loop biomass tax subsidy program, which includes not just chicken manure, but plant matter, yard waste, food waste and any number of other materials. To call the subsidy a “Chicken Poop Tax Credit” is more than a little tendentious.\n\nIn the end, like the Wastebook, Flake’s takedown of the flaws in the country’s system of tax expenditures is a hit-or-miss collection of truly egregious abuses and artificially inflated pseudo-scandals that seem more intended to outrage than to identify serious problems."

The lawsuit charged that during lab tests the gowns failed at rates that “greatly exceeded” acceptable levels, allowing liquid, bacterial and viral pathogens to penetrate the products, risking the lives of doctors, nurses, medical technicians and other hospital professions.\n\nKimberly-Clark executives knew about the problems since at least 2013 and yet continued to sell the flawed medical gowns. Indeed, internal company e-mails and documents from the companies revealed employees describing the manufacturing process as \"crap\" and acknowledging that they were knowingly using defective and substandard equipment to make the gowns in Honduras.\n\nBut instead of recalling the tens of millions of flawed gowns and revealing the truth to the public, the lawsuit claimed the companies concealed the information.\n\nOn Monday, Kimberly-Clark announced that it would challenge last week’s verdict. The company said in a statement that it believes the jury’s verdict was contrary to the evidence presented at trial and that the punitive damages awarded were baseless and excessive. “Nearly seventy million MicroCool gowns have been sold without a single complaint of an injury,” Kimberly-Clark insisted.\n\nLawyers say the damages may be among the largest ever awarded to a plaintiff in a case brought against a U.S. medical device manufacturer. Undoubtedly, the verdict has given Kimberly-Clark a huge public relations black eye.\n\nBut the mega-manufacturer may escape having to pay even a dime in penalties. That’s because, pursuant to an indemnification agreement between the two defendants, Halyard Health is obligated to pay the entirety of the $454 million awarded by the jury."

    "text": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson isn’t leaving a whole lot of room for negotiation about the future of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as he heads into high-stakes meetings with Russian officials in Moscow. In advance of his arrival in the Russian capital, Tillerson told reporters at a meeting of the G-7 countries in Italy that Russia must choose whether to align itself with Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, or to be a partner to the United States and the West. Either way, he said, Assad must go.\n\n“It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson said. “But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.”\n\nRelated: Russia Walks Back Threats of Retaliation If the US Strikes Syria Again\n\nSyria has been engaged in a complex civil war since mid-2011, and the Assad regime has earned international condemnation for indiscriminate attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas, including the use of chemical weapons and “barrel bombs.” A chemical attack on the city of Idlib last week killed dozens, including many children, and spurred President Trump to order airstrikes on the base from which the assault was launched.\n\nTillerson’s de facto ultimatum was issued after the secretary of state participated in a side meeting at the G-7 that involved representatives from a number of countries, including multiple Middle Eastern nations such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n“We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people -- Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,” Tillerson said. “Or Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia's interests longer term.”\n\nBut persuading Russia to abandon Assad will not be simple. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime is running short on allies, after his invasion of neighboring Ukraine in 2014 and the Kremlin’s continued support of armed rebels fighting the government in that country’s Donbas region.\n\nRelated: Why The US Can't Just Take Out Assad\n\nIn Syria, Russia has its only substantial military base in the eastern Mediterranean and its largest concentration of troops anywhere outside of Russia. The prospect of losing that foothold if Assad is overthrown may not be acceptable to the Kremlin from a strategic perspective.\n\nIn addition, Russia has put its reputation as an international power on the line in Syria. By supporting the Assad regime it has laid down a marker that it would be exceedingly embarrassing to back away from under US pressure, both internationally and domestically.\n\nIn a statement issued in advance of Tillerson’s arrival, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the meeting’s purpose, “first and foremost” would be to assess the United States’ willingness to seek “stabilization and normalization” of the two countries’ increasingly contentious bilateral relationship.\n\n“In connection with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s working visit to Russia beginning later today we would like to point out that we hope for productive talks,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by the government-run TASS news agency. \"This is important for the prospects of our bilateral interaction and for the general climate in the international scene.\"\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nThe TASS report made no mention of the conflict in Syria. However, other Kremlin-run news services played up the issue. The RT website declared that Tillerson was arriving in Moscow as “tension spikes” over Syria.\n\nSputnik News cited Russian political analyst Pavel Svyatenkov, who declared that the stepped-up US activity in Syria was some sort of negotiating tactic. \"Given that the situation in Syria remains Russia's bargaining chip in its talks with the United States, the Trump administration is apparently trying to deprive Russia of it,\" Svyatrenkov said."

    "text": "The Trump administration, at work on a new plan for tax reform, is reportedly considering a plan to cross into one of the most dangerous territories in American politics: fiddling with the Social Security system. According to multiple reports, the administration is entertaining the possibility of eliminating the 12.4 percent payroll tax, which would require it to find a new dedicated funding source for the retirement checks that millions of Americans count on in their old age.\n\nThe plan, first reported by the Associated Press, would be part of a major overhaul of the tax code that would make the US system look much more like that of many European nations, which long ago adopted a Value Added Tax model. A VAT is a form of consumption tax that falls on consumers rather than producers.\n\nRelated: Think Trump Will Make Your Taxes Easier Next Year? Don’t Get Your Hopes Up\n\nThe VAT model under consideration would generate significantly more revenue than the current corporate tax, allowing the elimination of the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and, all other things equal, giving workers a considerable boost in their take-home pay. (The 12.4 percent payroll tax is split evenly, with 6.2 percent paid by the employer and 6.2 percent paid out of the worker’s gross wages.)\n\nBut as former president George W. Bush learned, people start getting nervous when politicians in Washington mess with Social Security.\n\nFor better or worse, the system was set up by design to be funded by a dedicated tax that appeared on every worker’s pay stub throughout their working lives. One thing that did was create a sense of ownership of the benefit -- a sense of “entitlement,” though not in the pejorative sense of the word as it is commonly used today.\n\nSocial Security is an entitlement not because people feel they are due to something that they didn’t earn, but because they believe, rightly, that they have paid for it directly from their wages throughout their working lives.\n\nRelated: The Fed, the Reality of Tax Cuts, and Donald Trump\n\nIf the payroll tax is eliminated, and the system is funded by Congressional appropriations, the link between work and the Social Security check that one receives in retirement will be weakened, and that could have real ramifications for future debates about the program.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why it is easier for Congress to propose cuts in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or other social safety net entitlement programs than it is to talk about cutting Social Security benefits. One of them is that many people view the recipients of social safety net spending as undeserving of a government handout, while Social Security recipients are merely collecting what they are owed.\n\n(The fact is that most Americans who live long enough to collect Social Security will actually get far more back from the system than they paid into it. So, while they may not be getting something they don’t deserve, they’re definitely getting more than they deserve.)\n\nThe Trump team’s tax plans are in the formative stages at this point, and the suggestion that Congress should get under the hood of Social Security and change out the funding mechanism may be nothing more than an attempt to see how receptive, or not, the public is to the idea of Trump and Congressional Republicans tinkering with the program.\n\nEventually, though, some president and some Congress are going to have to find a way to change the Social Security system to ensure long-term solvency. The reaction to this proposal could provide some indication of whether that’s a possibility during the Trump presidency."

    "text": "The Trump administration is closing a $600 million deal to permit the sale of a dozen highly sophisticated turboprop fighter planes to Nigeria to combat the Boko Haram Islamic terrorists despite the Nigerian air force’s repeated bombing of civilian targets.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, the White House is expected to formally notify Congress of its controversial decision to sell as many as 12 Embraer A-29 Super Tucano aircraft equipped with special targeting and surveillance equipment.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nNigeria – a strong African ally of the U.S. -- has been attempting to purchase the highly versatile aircraft since 2015. President Obama had given preliminary approval of the sale shortly before he left office, but the deal was then put on hold.\n\nThe turboprop light attack airplane – which costs as little as $10 million per copy or as much as nearly $50 million, depending on the specs -- is particularly effective for counter-insurgency, close aerial reconnaissance and close air support.\n\nIn skirmishes in remote areas, the Super Tucano can be a game changer. It functions and navigates well in rugged terrain with high temperatures and high humidity.\n\nThe plane is equipped with a wide array of armaments, including precision-guided munitions. It boasts advanced avionics, communications, and sensors and can operate from remote, unpaved airstrips. It has a maximum speed of 367 mph and a flight ceiling of 6.6 miles.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nAlthough Nigeria is considered an important ally and economic partner for the U.S., its tactics in fighting Boko Haram have generated sharp criticism within the international community -- and raised questions about the wisdom of the proposed sale of the Super Tucanos.\n\nThe Nigerian air force has bombed civilian targets at least three times in recent years. Most recently, as many as 236 civilians and aid workers were killed on January 17 when a Nigerian fighter jet repeatedly bombed a camp at Rann, near the border with Cameroon, where civilians had fled to escape Boko Haram.\n\nAmnesty International has also accused Nigeria's military of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the killings of an estimated 8,000 Boko Haram suspects. Trump nevertheless indicated in February that he would approve the plane deal during a call with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, according to reports.\n\nRelated: Newsmaker: Pressure Grows on Nigeria's Central Bank Governor\n\nThe aircraft sales to Nigeria – which boasts the largest economy in Africa -- are many military sales to other countries that are undergoing a final review before being submitted to Congress for approval.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 200 Super Tucanos operating in 10 countries in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. With the help of the U.S., the highly lethal aircraft was added to the Afghan air force in the spring of 2016 for use in that country’s long-standing war with the Taliban. The attack aircraft is manned by Afghan pilots who were trained in the U.S. before deployment.\n\nThe plane is manufactured by Embraer S.A., a Brazilian conglomerate and one of the largest aerospace companies in the world. Embraer operates a Super Tucanos production line in Jacksonville, Florida, in partnership with the privately held Sierra Nevada Corp. of Sparks, Nevada."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/10/Why-US-Cant-Just-Take-Out-Assad",
    "text": "The Trump administration has done an abrupt about-face on Syria, contradicting its own nascent foreign policy. Within 24 hours, it went from calling out the Assad regime for using chemical weapons to launching missiles at military targets. As limited as the strikes were, there are also statements that plans are in the works to target Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: It “would seem there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of Assad on April 6.\n\nAs costly as inaction has been in the six years since the Arab Spring uprisings first took hold in Syria, recent history suggests that removing Assad in a hurry would be an even bigger mistake. In 16 years studying and working with complex conflicts like Syria, I have yet to see an exception to this rule.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nWe know where this goes next\n\nTargeting Assad would likely give birth to the same kind of catastrophe we saw in Libya after Muammar Gaddafi’s fall. In Libya, with no true civil governance to hold the structure together, tribal alliances collapsed and a four-way fight for power emerged. It continues even now, accented by a growing presence of the Islamic State. The power vacuum that would follow the sudden and unwise removal of Assad could be worse than the current warfare, and nourish the already fertile growing conditions for violent extremist and paramilitary actors.\n\nAssad shouldn’t remain in power – he’s been proving that for six years. The recent Sarin gas attack is only the most recent on a long list of other human rights violations. But he should be part of a political and legal process that removes him. That process must come from the Syrians themselves, not from the outside. His departure should be negotiated with Syrian civil society leadership to legitimize the claim to power of a civilian government. Justice for his crimes should be served by Syrian courts.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nNature abhors a vacuum: Unlike in a game of chess, in war removing the king is not the end, but only another beginning. The idea that Syria still exists as it looks on the map is a fantasy. Part of its territory is held by the government, part is lost to the Islamic State, part of it is in rebel hands. It won’t come cleanly back together should the fighting suddenly end tomorrow. Tensions among rebel groups – which are already high – and between pro- and anti-IS forces will only increase with one combatant removed from the field. We can only attempt to predict where Assad’s loyalist forces will go with their leader removed.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nIn order for Assad’s withdrawal to be beneficial, it needs to come in the context of a sound Syrian-driven plan to move from immediate containment of violence to a return of civilian Syrian leadership and security. That plan currently doesn’t exist.\n\nOutside solutions never work: In the international development world, it’s been repeatedly shown that solutions to complicated problems can’t be imposed from outside. They won’t be sustainable and often do harm. Solutions have to come from inside a country’s own civil society. Otherwise, the result is to undermine the legitimacy of the same systems of politics and justice that are necessary to hold a population together in the long term. At present there is little left of Syrian civil society, but local councils continue to provide the connective tissue that holds the country together in areas not held by Assad. These organizations can jump-start efforts to create new democratic institutions.\n\nWhat’s the endgame? The classic underpinnings of our own strategic doctrine stress that military action should never be taken without a clear goal for a desired end-state. Of all the possible actions the U.S. could take, regime change is the most deceptively simple – but it doesn’t qualify as an end-state. In fact, it would usher in a more chaotic and violent environment that would be hard to contain even by several countries working together militarily.\n\nLibya and Iraq both demonstrated this all too clearly. They fell into chaos despite the efforts – or perhaps because of the efforts – of multinational coalitions. Thursday’s strikes only increased the sense of crisis and confusion, as everyone from the Syrians to the Russians to America itself wonders what the next move will be. Most worrisome, it’s unclear whether Trump himself has a firm grasp on what he’s doing next or why.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria: The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nWhither the ship of state? Most of America’s high-level diplomatic positions are still unfilled. These are positions that manage complex State Department processes, and which have the political heft to hold their own with the Department of Defense in fights over direction and leadership. They coordinate with international partners to ensure there are no miscommunications and that missteps are minimized. They provide much-needed analysis about dynamics and changes in conflict zones. They also help to mitigate the heightened probability of accidental clashes with international actors such as Russia in the confusion and increased tension that follows military action.\n\nThe infrastructure through which Assad mounts his offensives cannot be decisively destroyed by anything limited and quick. They are too dispersed and numerous. Unless the United States is willing to commit to a sustained and substantial campaign or to throw its weight behind a political end to the war, Thursday’s strikes are an empty gesture. At the same time, it’s also true that even a sustained and substantial military campaign would not bring about peace and security, and would put American troops on a battlefield that’s essentially one big crossfire. It’s a catch-22.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. has now literally fired its opening salvo limits the American government’s options – but the political process is a sustainable path that offers a way out of the catch, and there’s still time to put our weight behind that. It does neither the Syrian people nor our own security any good to find urgency overnight, only to make a bad situation worse.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation.

    "text": "The chances of the average American being able to file their taxes on a postcard this time next year are getting smaller by the day.\n\nThe Trump administration, once hopeful that it would see a substantive tax reform bill ready to move through Congress and to the president’s desk by the end of August, is effectively ditching that deadline, according to the Associated Press. The existing framework — a sort of Frankenstein’s monster of different proposals and pet projects — is being tossed aside to allow the White House and lawmakers to make a fresh start, the news wire reported on Monday.\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\nIn comments to Bloomberg, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn confirmed that the schedule is now more flexible. “Getting it done well and getting it done right is more important than getting it done soon. We are committed to getting it done this calendar year.”\n\nPresident Trump campaigned on a promise to completely overhaul the tax code and lower taxes for everyone while simultaneously funding a $1 trillion infrastructure program and a huge increase in spending on the military, all without raising the federal debt. He also promised to greatly simplify the process of filing taxes by eliminating many deductions and loopholes.\n\nAs in the case of reforming the health insurance market, though, it seems tax reform will be more complicated that the president anticipated.\n\nThe Trump White House has already suffered one major legislative setback in the failure of its promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In that case, the administration adopted a plan that was largely concocted by House Republican leaders, and Trump officials found themselves in the position of advocating an immensely unpopular bill that couldn’t even pass with a GOP majority in the House.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\nThere seems to be an effort underway to avoid repeating some of those problems with the tax legislation. For one, the White House has signaled that it plans to play an active role in the development of the proposal, and unlike its previous legislative effort, it will bring some people with relevant experience to the task.\n\nThe White House is staffed with former investment bankers who are bound to have strong opinions on the question of business taxes. Trump also just named Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute to chair his Council of Economic Advisers. Tax policy is one of Hassett’s main areas of interest.\n\nSo far, the existing tax plan has been a smorgasbord of disparate ideas and trial balloons, many of which appeal strongly to people with strong ideological points of view but might struggle to find broad support on their own.\n\nThere is wide agreement among both the White House and lawmakers on the need to slash or even eliminate corporate taxes. House leadership, for example, has been pushing a plan to replace the tax on corporate profits with a tax on imported goods and raw materials intended to spur domestic production.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Gamble on a Border Tax and Anger Millions of Walmart Shoppers?\n\nTrump himself has said that he is interested in imposing import taxes on goods on a country-by-country basis, generally in line with how fairly he believes other countries treat exports coming from the United States. Both of those proposals would likely drive up some prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nAnother factor that may have worked itself into the decision to start from scratch and hammer out a bill with Congress was the warning from the House Freedom Caucus last week that it is not willing to tolerate another major bill — like the health care proposal — that is written behind closed doors.\n\nIn an obvious shot across the bow, Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina toled Republican leaders not to spring a bill on his members at the last moment: “When a member sees the text for the first time in a leaked draft from Politico, therein is a problem.”\n\nBecause the Freedom Caucus has the power to scuttle any bill the GOP tries to pass with only Republican votes, it’s going to be difficult to deny them a seat at the table, and this delay may be a way for Trump and House leadership to signal that they are letting multiple factions within the party have a voice from the beginning of the process.\n\nRelated: Why Budget Hawks Want to Keep Obama’s ‘Cadillac Tax’\n\nWhatever the motivation, restarting the process in April with the hope of wrapping it up by year-end seems extremely optimistic, given the legislative knife-fight that any major tax reform proposal is guaranteed to become once plans start to produce winners and losers. After all, the last major tax reform bill happened in 1986, and it took years to hash out. There’s a reason why it hasn’t been successfully tried again since.\n\nThat whole filing on a postcard thing may be a few tax seasons away."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/10/Why-It-s-Too-Soon-Count-Steve-Bannon-Out",
    "text": "The MSM (mainstream media), as right-wing coo-coo clocks like Ann Coulter like to call America’s press corps, are delirious with glee over infighting within the White House and practically drooling in their “I’m With Her” coffee mugs now that Steve Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, seems to have been sidelined.\n\nThe story lines in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere over the past five days go mostly like this: The odd alliance between nationalist know-it-all Bannon, the former commandant of Breitbart News, and rich-kid know-it-all Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and himself a New York real estate hustler, has shattered.\n\nRelated: How Long Can Trump Tolerate the ‘President Bannon’ Headlines?\n\nKushner — along with his wife and No. 1 Trump offspring, Ivanka — had a strong hand in bringing in Bannon to lead the flailing Trump campaign last summer, and during the transition and the very early days of the young administration they seemed to have developed a strangely close working relationship.\n\nWhy so weird?\n\nBannon is a man on a mission to save America and Western Civilization from the Huns at the door — be they illegal immigrants crossing the border or manic Muslims armed to the teeth and taking selfies. He disdains globalism, espouses “economic nationalism,” has contempt for the corporate elite that puts profits before patriotism and doesn’t think the U.S. needs to police the planet.\n\nHis path to power — not-so-rich kid from Richmond, Naval officer, investment banker, filmmaker, conservative zealot — has been as idiosyncratic as his boss’s road to the Oval Office. Beyond that, Bannon is rumpled, profane, bombastic, sixtysomething and has been accused — probably unfairly — of being an anti-Semite.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nKushner is a man on a mission to fix everything that ails the country and the world, thereby proving he is the smartest Harvard grad in the global room. Like his father, Charles, who did time for being too enthusiastic in his donations to Democrats, he is a real-estate developer who helped restore the family empire while Dad was in the slammer. He also ran a low-circulation, quirky New York newspaper, The Observer.\n\nHe derives his newfound political power from his closeness to his father-in-law, the president. He is smooth, sleek, soft-spoken, well-dressed and until the campaign, a thirtysomething with presumably Manhattan Democratic values — save for his hard-right support of Israel (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once bunked in his room during a stay with the Kushner family).\n\nNow, many media stories say, Bannon and Kushner are at opposite ends of White House conference tables. Bannon and his lieutenants (including former Breitbart staffers) are lined up against Kushner, ex-Goldman Sachs President and Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and ex-Goldman exec Dina Powell.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\nIn the middle are Chief of Staff Reince Prebius, Press Secretary Sean Spicer (who worked for Prebius when he ran the Republican National Committee) and perhaps senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who joined the campaign around the same time as Bannon. She has other ties to Bannon but is basically a political operative for hire (early in the election cycle when she worked for Sen. Ted Cruz, she wasn’t above bashing Trump).\n\nWhat has so many members of the press so giddy is that Bannon has been booted from the National Security Council, where he had installed himself while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThis weekend, Bloomberg reported that K.T. McFarland, a Fox News commentator and veteran of the Reagan White House installed by disgraced former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, was also stepping down, further depoliticizing the NSC.\n\nThose developments are seen as new NSC chief Gen. H.R. McMaster exerting his influence. But besides restoring the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Joe Dunford, and intelligence overseer Dan Coats, Powell has been made a Deputy National Security Adviser — a win for the Kushner/Cohn cabal, which Bannon reportedly calls the “West Wing Democrats.”\n\n“Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon’s economic nationalism is Washington’s military hawks,” Robert Draper wrote in The New York Times Magazine on April 2.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria — The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nOn Meet the Press yesterday, Times Pentagon correspondent Helene Cooper said that the military “thinks that Kushner is where their future is.”\n\nThat may be so, but while Trump’s “America First” message was all Bannon and the strategist is said to have argued against the strike on Syria last Thursday, it might be a mistake to conclude he is against U.S. military might.\n\nBannon has a degree in national security from Georgetown, served as a special assistant to the chief of Naval operations at the Pentagon during his years in the Navy and has a daughter who graduated from West Point.\n\nIt might also be a mistake to think Bannon will be out like Flynn sometime soon.\n\nIn a discussion of the infighting at the White House on Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka of the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute said: “Bannon is the one who is expendable.” And according to reports, Bannon threatened to quit when he was removed from the NSC but was talked out of leaving by Rebekah Mercer, daughter of billionaire Trump backer Robert Mercer and the person who brought Bannon and Conway into the Trump campaign.\n\nRelated: Feuding Trump Aides Meet and Agree to End 'Palace Intrigue': Source\n\nFor now, Kushner and Cohn — who has been talked about as a possible replacement for Prebius as chief of staff — appear to be in the ascendancy (and as Ivanka’s husband, Kushner is unlikely to ever be demoted), though with as mercurial a president as Trump, there are no guarantees of anything. Bloomberg quoted McMaster as saying of Bannon’s departure from the NSC: “This is not as significant as it appears. Steve Bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so.”\n\nReuters and others have reported that warring White House factions are working to repair relations, and there are two big reasons Bannon won’t be toast: The Mercers and the base — the blue collars championed by Bannon who voted for Trump and will be needed again in the future.\n\nThere is also the fact that were he not in the White House, Bannon untethered to Trump could be a serious danger to his presidency as it goes more, um, mainstream.\n\nAs Lyndon Johnson is said to have remarked about FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover: “It's probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in.”"

    "text": "Kremlin officials on Monday publicly distanced themselves from a what appeared to be a threat by commanders on the ground in Syria to attack US interests if the Trump administration orders any more strikes against the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe move came in reaction to a statement published by the Assad-friendly Al-Watan newspaper and attributed to the joint command center in Syria that is shared by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah militia and other forces supporting the regime in the ongoing civil war.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Still in Search of a Coherent Syria Policy\n\n“The aggression against Syria oversteps all red lines,” the statement said. “We will react firmly to any aggression against Syria and to any infringement of red lines, whoever carries them out.”\n\nThe statement was plainly a reaction to the decision by President Trump last Thursday to fire 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase in retaliation for the Assad regime’s apparent use of chemical weapons against the civilian population of the town of Idlib, an attack that killed dozens, including children. It also came not long after top Trump administration officials said plainly that more attacks against Syria were possible if the regime continues to target civilians.\n\n“The strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the UN, your agreements under the chemical weapons charter back in 2013 that those would not go without a response in the future,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in an interview with ABC News broadcast Sunday morning.\n\nRelated: Trump Bombed Syria’s Airfield. Now, Here Comes Putin’s Response\n\n“Our objective was to deter continued use of chemical weapons,” said National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. “We’re prepared to do more.” However, the Russian leadership, while it condemned the US attack, quickly repudiated the statement published in Al-Watan.\n\n“We are not aware about that; we cannot confirm that, and we do not know where Reuters got this and where these anonymous sources appeared from again,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, referring to one of the news wires that reported on the statement.\n\nUntil the promise of retaliation was published, Russian officials had been very careful in their condemnation of the US attack, claiming that it violated international law, among other things, but not threatening action against the United States.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that the missile attacks had placed the US “on the verge” of conflict with Russia in a highly critical Facebook post.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\n“The Trump administration proved that it will fiercely fight the legitimate Syrian government, in a tough contradiction with international law and without UN approval, in violation of its own procedures stipulating that the Congress must first be notified of any military operation unrelated to aggression against the US. On the verge of a military clash with Russia.”\n\nMedvedev added, “This military action is a clear indication of the US President’s extreme dependency on the opinion of the Washington establishment, the one that the new president strongly criticized in his inauguration speech. Soon after his victory, I noted that everything would depend on how soon Trump’s election promises would be broken by the existing power machine. It took only two and a half months.”\n\nAs a backdrop to this, senior US officials including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain over the weekend all suggested that US sanctions against Russia should be tightened as a consequence for ongoing Kremlin support for the Assad regime.\n\nThe further deterioration of the relationship between Washington and Moscow comes just days before Secretary of State Tillerson is scheduled to visit Russia for high-level talks with senior officials."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/10/All-Those-Warnings-About-National-Debt-May-Understate-Problem",
    "text": "The national debt is on track to reach 150 percent of gross domestic product by 2047, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s 2017 long-term budget outlook. Publicly held debt – the amount the Treasury borrows to keep the government afloat, currently about $14.5 trillion – is already at post-war high of 77 percent of GDP, and the CBO sees it doubling over the next three decades.\n\nThe CBO outlook paints a fairly grim picture, but a well-known spending watchdog says the national debt may be in even worse shape. A new analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that given the right set of policies and economic circumstances, the debt could actually rise as high as 225 percent of GDP over the next three decades.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts - Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nOf course, predicting economic performance and the size of the cumulative public debt over the next 30 years is no easy task. Some might say it’s a fool’s mission.\n\nEven so, at a time when the gross national debt is fast approaching $20 trillion and the Treasury is bumping up against the limits of its borrowing authority, this exercise by the CRFB is worth considering.\n\nThe crux of the difference in the forecasts by CBO and CRFB is this: CBO uses a baseline reflecting “current law,” which means that the agency’s numbers crunchers assumes that no new legislation will be passed in the future other than what is needed to keep the government operating at a normal pace. That includes approving budgets, enacting appropriations bills, funding government agencies and programs and financing needed public works projects.\n\nWhile other legislation will no doubt be proposed and enacted, CBO says it’s impossible to predict what might happen, so they don’t try to anticipate major changes in policy. But the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget takes a different approach.\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\nAnalysts for the anti-deficit research organization go out on a limb in making predictions. They assume, for instance, that a number of temporary tax cuts and business loopholes will be made permanent at some point. Also, they are counting on Congress to permanently repeal three Obamacare taxes currently in abeyance – the medical device tax, the health insurers’ tax and the “Cadillac” tax on high-end health insurance policies offered by employers.\n\nAdditionally, the CRFB makes the not unrealistic assumption that Congress will permanently repeal the spending caps on defense and domestic programs mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Those discretionary spending caps have been partially repealed in each of the past four years, but are scheduled to come back in 2018. President Trump has proposed lifting the defense spending cap again next year to make way for a huge military buildup, and there’s a good chance he’ll get his way, especially in the wake of the recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria.\n\nThese anticipated policy changes would reduce taxes by $752 billion over the coming decade, boost general spending by $1 trillion and increase interest costs on the debt by $260 billion, according to CFRFB.\n\n“The result would be $2 trillion higher debt, which would bring debt to 96 percent of GDP by 2027 as opposed to 89 percent,” the group’s report states. “By 2047, along with a slight decrease in GDP growth, these policies would bring debt to 180 percent of GDP compared to 150 percent under current law.”\n\nFinally, the CRFP considers an “alternative fiscal scenario” in which revenues are lower after tax cuts and non-health care spending increases to its historical norm of about 10 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, debt would rise to 225 percent of GDP by 2047, nearly three times higher than the current level."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/10/Fed-Reality-Tax-Cuts-Reality-and-Donald-Trump",
    "text": "For many years, Republicans argued that tax cuts for the wealthy pay for themselves. Cutting taxes on the wealthy, according to Republicans, allows them to keep a larger share of anything new they create and this leads to new economic activity and new innovation – so much that the resulting increase in economic growth and tax revenue fully offsets the budgetary effects of the tax cuts. Everyone is better off as income “trickled down” from the top.\n\nWhat actually happened is that the tax cuts had very little, if any, impact on economic growth. Deficits went up, and somehow income never trickled down – if anything, it trickled up. Today, Republicans are less likely to argue that tax cuts pay for themselves, though you still hear it, but they still insist tax cuts for the wealthy magically increase economic growth and offset much of the revenue loss.\n\nRelated: It’s a Ruse: Tax Cuts Can’t be Financed by Reducing Government Waste\n\nBut even in the very unlikely case that Trump’s proposed tax cuts are successful (beyond increasing the income of the wealthy which many argue is the true goal), the economic growth rates Trump has promised are unlikely to be attained. In fact, if the economy is near full employment as it is now, output growth is unlikely to go up at all except briefly. To see why, it’s important to consider how the Federal Reserve will react to upward pressure on output.\n\nWhen the Fed sets interest rates, it reacts to the “output gap,” the difference between actual output and something known as the natural rate of output. The Fed also reacts to inflation, but for the moment let’s focus on the output gap.\n\nThe natural rate of output is the rate of economic activity that keeps labor and all other inputs to production fully employed and is sustainable in the long-run. When the economy begins to push above the natural rate, the Fed worries that inflation will rise above its target level of 2 percent. To guard against this, the Fed increases interest rates to slow economic activity and reduce the inflationary pressure, and it will keep raising interest rates until output stabilizes at the natural rate. No matter how much Trump tries to increase economic growth, the Fed will not let output rise above the natural rate, at least not for very long.\n\nRelated: The Big Risk in Trump's Plan to Cuts Taxes and Boost Spending\n\nBut if the natural rate of output is consistent with full employment – if labor and other resources are fully employed – how can output go above that level? The key is the word sustainable in the definition of the natural rate of output. Think of it this way. Over the course of a semester in college, there is only so much studying that can be done day-to-day and week-to-week – there is a maximum sustainable level of effort. But when exams approach, it’s possible to work for, say, 20 hours or more to get ready. The students’ output rises above the natural rate in the short-run, but it will fall back to the natural level over time.\n\nThe same is true for labor and capital. For awhile, when demand is high (due hypothetically to tax cuts, but this can happen for other reasons as well), labor can be pushed beyond 40 hours per week. A trucking fleet can pull trucks out of maintenance and put them on the road to meet the increased demand. The factory floor can be run full-time instead of stopping at intervals for the maintenance it needs. But to do this, workers must be paid overtime. Trucks and factories that do not get the maintenance they require will be more costly down the road, all of which force the firm to raise prices to cover the higher costs. That is, inflation will begin to go up.\n\nThe alternative to pushing labor and capital beyond their sustainable levels of use is to hire more workers, purchase more trucks, or build new factory capacity. But since the economy is already at full employment, labor, capital, and the resources needed to expand capacity must be bid away from other firms. The firm must be willing to pay more than other firms that are also attempting to expand and meet the increase in aggregate demand. Bidding labor, capital, and other inputs to production away from other firms raises costs and hence prices too, and would also be inflationary.\n\nRelated: US Debt Is Going to Soar Over the Next 30 Years: CBO Report\n\nThe only way for the increase in demand to be non-inflationary is for the natural rate of output to increase as a result of the tax cuts, that is, for aggregate supply to go up and match the increase in demand. But that is the essence of supply side economics, to increase our productive capacity, and we know how well that has worked out in the past. Somehow, however, it doesn’t stop Republicans from continuing to make supply side arguments to justify the tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nThere may be a way for tax cuts to increase our productive capacity, but they would need to be very different from the tax cuts that have been proposed by the Trump administration. For example, well-targeted and well-constructed investment tax credits can enhance our ability to produce goods and services.\n\nTrump has promised to increase economic growth substantially, but it’s unlikely he will succeed based upon evidence of similar tax cuts in the past. Even in the unlikely event he does succeed in stimulating demand, the Fed will not let economic growth reach the levels he has promised. Wonder who he’ll blame for his failure?"

    "text": "Despite high premiums and diminished consumer choices that might deter consumers from enrolling in Obamacare, a new financial analysis concludes that the individual health insurance market has shaken off its early losses and will likely break even this year.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global Ratings of the performance of scores of Blue Cross plans in nearly three dozen states also predicts that insurance companies providing millions of Americans with subsidized coverage under Obamacare will begin showing modest profits in 2018.\n\nRelated: Insurer’s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We’re Out\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s report describes a “fragile” market that has begun to stabilize after a shaky launch in 2014 and that appears on the road to profitability in the coming years -- unless Republican lawmakers pull the rug out from under it.\n\nThat’s just when President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) are hoping to replace Obamacare with a GOP alternative that so far has gained little traction on Capitol Hill. The report warns that any significant overhaul or increased uncertainty over subsidies and other vital aspects of the program may lead to a much different -- and far more negative –result for insurers.\n\n“Our analysis of 2016 results and the market enrollment so far in 2017 shows that the ACA individual market is not in a ‘death spiral,’” the report stated.\" But it isn't on a stable footing either.” If the market continues on its current course, with a “few fixes” rather than a major overhaul, “We expect 2018 . . . to be one of gradual improvement with more insurers reporting positive (albeit low single-digit) margins,” according to S&P.\n\nWhile the S&P study focuses on insurer profitability and the likelihood the industry can overcome economic challenges in the coming years, it doesn't speak to the larger question of the impact of rising premiums and deductibles on consumers -- or what can be done to increase access to affordable health care.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nThe latest Kaiser Family Foundation Tracking Poll found that two-thirds of the public believe it is “a good thing” that Congress didn’t pass the GOP replacement plan while nearly three-fourths of Americans think Trump and Congress should do what they can to make the current system work. Polls also show that, for the first time, a majority of the public favors Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nThe S&P report looked at Blue Cross plans covering about five million of the estimated 8 million people who are covered under Obamacare through 2017.\n\nSince Obamacare was first launched in 2014, an alarming number of major insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealth Group. Humana, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and Anthem have either pulled out of some states or are threatening to do so after incurring millions of dollars in losses.\n\nAnd based on recent announcements of more departures by insurers, some states like Tennessee and Iowa may have counties with no insurers on the exchange in 2018. The situation could worsen in the coming months if uncertainty over the future of Obamacare persists, the report says. Insurance companies must file their initial rates and products for 2018 in May and June, and more may decide to pull out of the system if they consider the situation too risky.\n\n“Having them decide without adequate information may result in either higher-than-expected premium rate increases, or a few insurers hesitating to remain in the market,” according to S&P.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Americans Are Blaming Paul Ryan for the Health Care Debacle\n\nThe report suggests that after several years of turmoil and losses in the Obamacare markets, many insurers are beginning to better understand how the new subsidized individual markets work. Most have made adjustments in premiums and the number of doctors and hospitals in their networks to enhance their profitability.\n\nAmong key findings of the report:"

    "text": "More than 48 hours after President Trump ordered a missile assault on a Syrian government airbase as retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians in the town of Idlib, the administration was still unable to articulate a clear explanation of how US policy toward Syria and its leader, Bashar al-Assad, has changed, and why.\n\nTop officials from the administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House National Security Adviser all appeared on the Sunday talk shows, and presented seemingly contradictory and at times, frankly incoherent explanations of what the United States’ role in the Syrian conflict will be moving forward.\n\nRelated: Trump Bombed Syria’s Airfield. Now, Here Comes Putin’s Response\n\nTillerson, for example, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, said that the US stands prepared to take additional action against Assad if he uses chemical weapons again, while at the same time making the plainly incorrect claim that this represents no change in US military policy toward Syria.\n\nAsked by host George Stephanopoulos if he was saying that there had been no change in US posture on the use of force against Assad, he agreed. But then, he said, “The strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the UN, your agreements under the chemical weapons charter back in 2013 that those would not go without a response in the future.”\n\nOf course, the strikes themselves were a major reversal for Trump, who campaigned as a non-interventionist “America First” candidate, and who has for years argued against getting involved in the Syrian civil war. And the promise of further attacks if chemical weapons are used again is plainly an escalation beyond a one-off “message” strike.\n\nUntil Thursday, the Trump administration seemed to be following the president’s original policy against greater involvement in Syria. As recently as March 30, both Tillerson and Haley had made public comments that seemed to suggest that removing Assad from power was at best a secondary goal for the United States and that his remaining was one possible outcome.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria: The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nAt the time, Tillerson said that “the longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people.”\n\nOn the same day, Haley said, “Our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out.” She added, “Do we think he's a hindrance? Yes. Are we going to sit there and focus on getting him out? No.”\n\nBy April 6, the day of the missile attack, though, the language was notably different.\n\n“Assad’s role in the future is uncertain, clearly, and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people,” Tillerson said in a brief press conference.\n\n“The process by which Assad would leave is something that requires an international community effort both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country to avoid further civil war and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving,” he said.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nAsked if he and President Trump would “organize an international coalition” to remove Assad, Tillerson responded, “Those steps are under way.”\n\nOn the same day, Haley also signaled that the US planned to lead an effort to remove Assad from power.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the US decision to about-face and rain 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles down on an airfield as Trump sat down to dinner on Thursday night was the Syrian regime’s apparent use of the deadly nerve agent Sarin in the attack on Idlib earlier in the week. The gas attack killed dozens and produced images of small children dead on the ground and others gasping for breath as they struggled to survive the effects of the noxious gas.\n\nBut what many found puzzling was that the attack on Idlib was different only in degree from what Assad’s regime has been doing, with some consistency, for years. The list of chemical attacks on rebel-held parts of Syria is long and detailed, and as Tillerson pointed out in interviews on This Week CBS’s Face the Nation, the Syrian military used chemical weapons twice in the week prior to the Idlib attack.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Strengthened His Hand on Defense Spending\n\nIt’s also unclear why gassing civilians drew such a dramatically different response than indiscriminately blowing them up with conventional explosives and the Assad regime’s “barrel bombs.”\n\nIt was a question that McMaster struggled to address in an appearance on Fox News Sunday.\n\n“We’re prepared to do more,” McMaster said. “We were prepared to do more two days ago as well. What’s significant about this strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime’s capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people but it was to send a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians\n\nHost Chris Wallace followed up by pointing out that Assad is still committing mass murder, just with different weapons, and asking if the US is now prepared to retaliate against him for attacks on civilians with conventional weapons as well. After several attempts to pin McMaster down, Wallace had to be satisfied with this statement: “The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.”"

    "text": "Last year, the federal government spent $576 billion on Medicaid coverage, and that total is projected to steadily rise in the coming years. Knowing that budget cuts are likely, the pressure is on the states that are responsible for managing their Medicaid programs to find ways to lower their costs.\n\nOne way to do that is by changing from a fee-for-service healthcare model to a managed care system. Today, 42 states have privately managed Medicaid, and 73 percent of the 81 million beneficiaries are now covered by private managed-care health plans, according to Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC). By comparison, just 55 percent of beneficiaries were in managed care programs in 2012.\n\n“Overall, things are going pretty well, as evidence by the fact that more and more states seem to add private coverage options, and states that already have it continue to expand the share of the population that is actually eligible for private coverage,” said Ari Gottlieb, a health care industry analyst with PwC.\n\n“There are always some challenges,” he added, noting that states frequently missed their start-up schedules and insurers and health care providers lost money in the early going. “That said, there are not a lot of states moving in the other direction.” But it’s not always a slam dunk to make that switch.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nAlabama officials stumbled recently in their effort to join most other states in privatizing their Medicaid coverage for the poor and disabled. Their mishaps offer a cautionary tale of some of the budgetary challenges facing state officials down the road if the Trump administration and Congress succeed in sharply reducing federal assistance for the massive health care program.\n\nAlabama legislators and Republican Gov. Robert Bentley had been pushing for several years to replace their state’s traditional Medicaid fee-for-service system with a managed care system that would force hospitals and doctors to deliver services to the poor and elderly within fixed per-capita costs, or absorb the financial losses.\n\nMore than 650,000 of the state’s one million Medicaid recipients would receive care through this approach. But Alabama couldn’t raise enough up-front funding to organize and launch the program last April. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services offered as much as $748 million over five years to help launch the pilot project, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nAnxious to keep the project alive, officials say they will begin enrolling beneficiaries into managed care by October 1. CMS responded in a March 30 letter approving the delay but is insisting on onsite inspections before allowing Alabama officials to move ahead.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nModern Healthcare says Alabama’s start-up snafus come on the heels of widespread problems in Iowa’s Medicaid managed-care program since it was launched early in 2016. Former Republican governor Terry E. Brandstad rushed through a fundamental transformation of the state’s traditional Medicaid program to a private managed-care model a year ago, before he left office to become U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nBrandstad insisted the new approach would save the state money. Instead, critics complain about inadequate patient access to health care, shoddy administration and revenue shortfalls for three insurers who are now demanding that the state assume more of the risk. A Des Moines Register editorial from April 1 described the state’s ongoing “ordeal” with managed care as “an April Fool’s joke with no end.”"

    "text": "In the wake of U.S. missile strikes against Syria, President Trump’s call for huge increase in defense spending is suddenly looking more likely to succeed.\n\nOvernight, the new president was transformed into a war-time commander-in-chief, one who received widespread kudos for his action from lawmakers as diverse as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ), both frequent critics of the president.\n\nRelated: America's Strike in Syria - The Generals Are Taking Charge\n\nMcCain, the most prominent defense hawk on Capitol Hill, on Friday praised Trump for standing up to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key Syrian ally.\n\n“Peace through strength,” McCain said during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe program. “We’ve got to rebuild our military. It’s in terrible shape.”\n\nIf the Tomahawk cruise missile attack on the al-Shayrat airfield in Syria – launched in retaliation for the a chemical weapons attack this week that killed more than 80 civilians -- was the prelude to sustained military intervention in that civil-war torn county, Trump could wind up with the tens of billions of additional dollars he is requesting for defense – or even more.\n\n“There’s no question historically that presidents who are involved in shooting wars find their defense budget hands strengthened,” said Gordon Adams, a defense spending expert. “There’s almost a one-to-one correlation historically. If you’re at war, your requests for defense budgets are generally approved with a speed that would blind you.”\n\nTrump has ambitions to preside over a Reagan-era-style military buildup, and ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nHe is also calling for a major buildup of all four branches of the military, including more troops, jet fighters, ships and other weaponry.\n\nTrump on March 16 formally asked Congress for $54 billion of additional defense spending in fiscal 2018 – a 10 percent increase -- by lifting a statutory cap on the Pentagon budget while cutting deeply into practically every government agency to offset the increased cost. While he has received pushback from a number of senior Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the scope of the cuts he is seeking in domestic programs -- especially at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State Department, Housing and Urban Development and National Institutes of Health -- Trump is likely to win most of the defense spending increases he is seeking for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.\n\nUntil now, however, his request for an additional $30 billion for defense in the current fiscal year and the offsetting cuts in domestic programs has generally been met with derision. There are only three weeks remaining before a continuing resolution expires and Congress could be faced with another partial government shutdown. Lawmakers in both parties are eager to finish up work on the fiscal 2017 appropriations without have to try to shoe-horn in extra defense spending and cuts to popular programs.\n\nNow, however, it is far more likely that Trump could wind up with all the fresh defense dollars he wants if he decides to escalate U.S. military involvement in Syria. And if the country is suddenly put on war-time footing and (more) American troops are put in harm’s way, Congress may be open to rewriting the 2017 appropriations bill or accepting an emergency supplemental to meet Trump’s defense spending demands for this year.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nAdams, a professor emeritus at American University, said a lot will depend on Trump’s next moves and how aggressive he becomes in challenging Russian and Iranian influence over the course of the Syrian civil war. “If we see more direct involvement in the civil war in Syria as a consequence, a repeated use of American Tomahawks and fighter aircraft, a decision to create or maintain some kind of a safe zone in northern Syria patrolled or policed by American military power, all of these things are steps down the road to deeper engagement.”\n\n“And any deeper engagement that involves putting American men and women at risk and firing real things, strengthens the president’s hand when it comes to budget time,” he added. “It’s axiomatic, practically.”\n\nStan Collender, a budget expert and executive vice president of Qorvis MSLGROUP, thinks that it would take more than a single missile attack on a Syria air field to make Congress completely pliant on defense spending issues. Moreover, while Trump’s actions have generally been applauded, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and a handful of other lawmakers complained that Trump launched the attack without consulting with Congress and must seek congressional authorization.\n\n“If it’s a one-time activity, I don’t see it making much of a difference at all,” said Collender. “By the time Congress gets back in two weeks from recess, this will largely be forgotten. But if it continues in some form – if there’s another bombing strike, if there’s saber rattling and he wants to commit ground troops to it, then I could see there being some need by Congress to provide extra dollars for 2017.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/07/Why-March-s-Shockingly-Weak-Jobs-Report-No-Reason-Panic",
    "text": "The relatively weak jobs numbers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday are no reason to worry about a sudden slowdown of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe 98,000 jobs added in March — well shy of the 180,000 economists had been expecting — may have come as a shock to people who have become accustomed to monthly gains in the neighborhood of 200,000, but economists believe the disappointing headline number was largely due to a major snowstorm that hit the country during the week the survey was conducted.\n\n“After the unseasonably warm January and February, which pushed monthly job gains back above 200,000, there was always going to be some pay back in March, when the weather snapped back to seasonal norms, including some heavy snowstorms,” wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.\n\nRelated: Why the 2020 Census Could Blow a Huge Hole in the Federal Budget\n\nOne piece of evidence for that theory is that the fall-off in job growth was accompanied by a drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent to 4.5 percent, a level the U.S. hasn’t enjoyed in nearly 10 years. A broader measure of unemployment — one that includes people unable to find work within the past month, people working part-time who would prefer to be employed full-time and people who are unemployed but want to work and have sought a job in the past year — also fell sharply, from 9.5 percent to 8.9 percent.\n\n“We suspect the three-month average job gain of 178,000 is more indicative of the underlying trend in job growth,” J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli said.\n\nThe bottom line is that today’s report is unlikely to change the prevailing sentiment among Federal Reserve officials about the need to continue raising interest rates to fend off future inflation.\n\nIan Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said that the more important thing to note about the latest jobs report is that the unemployment rate is now at the very bottom of the range of the Fed’s estimate of full employment — the line at which the tightness in the labor market triggers inflation.\n\n“For the Fed, the unemployment rate is the ultimate arbiter of the tightness of the labor market, and the prospect of the rate continuing to fall towards 4% will be very disconcerting,” he wrote.\n\nRelated: IRS Chief Warns: Budget Cuts Could Cost the US Billions\n\nEconomists expect the Fed, which raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in December and then again in March, to nudge rates up again in June. The report released on Friday, with the sharp movement in unemployment rates, only strengthened that impression."

    "text": "Donald Trump’s swift and decisive strike against Syria on Thursday may reassure allies and give pause to America’s enemies, but behind what’s being called by many a measured military response to a gas attack on Syrian civilians is this: The generals empowered by the President are now taking charge.\n\nTrump has salted his young Administration with former and -- in the case of National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster – current military leaders, and the move against the repressive and murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad demonstrates that all that gold braid isn’t just window dressing: The President is listening to the generals – especially former Marine General James Mattis, now Defense Secretary, and McMaster -- as they shake off the shackles of the micromanaging Obama Administration.\n\nRelated: Trump Acts on Obama’s “Red Line” by Launching Missiles at Syrian Targets\n\nBut it’s not just the barrage of 59 Tomahawk missiles to neutralize the Syrian air base from which the chemical attack was launched that signals a change in the management of U.S. military and foreign policy.\n\nEarlier in the week, General McMaster – according to multiple accounts and analyses -- exerted his authority and engineered the removal of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council.\n\nThe appointment of Bannon, the political architect of Trump’s once-improbable election victory, to the NSC and the back-benching of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence, who were demoted from full council membership, caused consternation among national security professionals.\n\nBannon’s removal, the restoration of Marine General Joe Dunford and intelligence chief Dan Coats to the NSC and the addition of former Goldman Sachs executive Dina Powell as Deputy National Security Adviser demonstrates that Trump is trying to put to rest concerns about the politicization of an advisory body charged with giving the President untainted options when he must make critical decisions.\n\nOn MSNBC’s Morning Joe today, political analyst John Heilemann asked Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a frequent critic of the President, about Bannon’s removal. McCain said the question of whether Trump would listen to his strong national security team has been answered, and earlier in the show said that the President has restored the U.S. credibility lost when Obama failed to act after Assad crossed “a red line” when he used chemical weapons in 2013.\n\nMcCain said Mattis and McMasters realize that the situation in Syria “will be a long, hard slog” but he said America can expect more enthusiasm from its allies because of that restoration of credibility.\n\nRelated: Trump Bombed Syria’s Airfield. Now, Here Comes Putin’s Response\n\nThe strike against Syria sends several messages from Trump and the American military:\n\nTo Russia, it says: Rein in your client state Syria and think about a political solution that while it may not include regime change, alters the equation in what has become an intractable civil war and a human rights nightmare.\n\nTo Iran, it says: Back off. Your free hand and continuing efforts to destabilize the region and exert influence are being challenged. And certainly, Tehran may see the message as personally signed by Secretary Mattis, who clashed with the Obama Administration when he was a Marine general over not taking a harder line toward Iran.\n\nTo North Korea, it says: Your erratic war-mongering will not be tolerated. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Morning Joe that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must be wondering, “What am I dealing with?”\n\nMcCain also pointed to the threat from Pyongyang. “The most immediate crisis we have right now is not in the Middle East, it’s this crazy fat kid” in North Korea, he said."

    "text": "The Russian government and its state-run media erupted in indignation on Friday, after President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base in retaliation for a chemical attack carried out against civilians in the town of Idlib earlier this week. As Kremlin officials condemned the attack and announced multiple measures in response, propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik hurried to characterize the strikes as poorly executed and ineffective.\n\nThe Kremlin on Friday announced three distinct steps it would take in response to Trump’s decision to have 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at the airfield from which the US believes the chemical attacks were launched.\n\nRelated: Here's What Firing 59 Tomahawk Missiles at Syria's Airfield Cost\n\nSuspension of De-Confliction Agreements\n\nIt has suspended an agreement with the United States to keep lines of communications open between military officials on the ground in and around Syria to prevent accidentally engaging with one another. The process, known as “de-confliction” applies particularly to operations involving air strikes. The US reported, and the Kremlin acknowledged that Russian officials were warned about last night’s strikes in advance. There have, so far, been no reports of Russian casualties.\n\n\n\nThe home page of the Kremlin-run Sputnik News on Friday\n\nThis move has the obvious effect of creating a more dangerous situation in Syria for troops from both countries.\n\nBeefing Up Syria’s Air Defenses\n\nOn Friday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said, “In order to protect the most sensitive objects of the Syrian infrastructure,” the Kremlin would put in place “a system of measures to bolster and increase the effectiveness of the Syrian armed forces’ air defense systems.”\n\nRussia has already supplied Syria with significant air defenses, including state-of-the-art anti-aircraft missiles. The move to strengthen them further is a clear message to Trump that further escalation against Russian client Bashar al-Assad, particularly is it involves manned US aircraft, will come with increased risk.\n\nRelated: Trump Acts on Obama’s “Red Line” by Launching Missiles at Syrian Targets\n\nAdding a Cruise Missile Frigate\n\nThe Russian Navy announced that the cruise missile frigate The Admiral Grigorovich, will stop in the Syrian port of Tartus on the Mediterranean coast. The Russian TASS news agency says the ship will stay on post for at least a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether this is truly a direct response to the US attacks or not. TASS reports that the ship was already in the Black Sea straits on Thursday, meaning that it was likely headed into the Mediterranean already. However, regardless of whether the move is related to the attacks, it represents an escalation of the Russian presence in and around Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, apparently without irony, announced that President Vladimir Putin had condemned the US attack on Syria “as aggression against a sovereign nation,” that was “in violation of international law and also under an invented pretext.”\n\nIt bears mentioning that aggression against sovereign nations in violation of international law and also under an invented pretext is actually one of Putin’s specialties.\n\nRelated: A Fleet of ‘Lightning Carriers’: The Marines’ Big Plans for the F-35\n\n“This step deals significant damage to US-Russian ties, which are already in a deplorable state,” Peskov added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin’s propaganda outlets were busy posting pictures of a sunglasses-wearing Putin looking grim and decisive, and downplaying the effectiveness of US strikes.\n\n“According to the data recording equipment, only 23 missiles reached the Syrian air base,” the Defense Ministry’s Konashenkov said. “The place of the fall of the other missiles is unknown.”\n\nHe added, “The combat effectiveness of the US massive missile strike on Syria’s airbase was thus very low. The strike destroyed a logistics warehouse, a training building, a canteen, six MiG-23 planes in the repair hangars and also a radar station. The runway, taxiways and parked planes of the Syrian Air Force have not been damaged.”\n\nReports of casualties were mixed, with most saying about six people were killed in the attack."

    "text": "Over the last decade, investors have grown accustomed to a Federal Reserve that constantly coddled them, allayed their fears and did everything possible to support the financial markets and asset prices. The Fed also carefully communicated policy to avoid any nervousness in the hearts of investors and \"verbally intervened\" to nip any downturn in the bud — like back in late 2014, when stocks were careening lower on Ebola fears, and another round of bond buying was teased.\n\nNow the worm has turned. The Fed has dramatically quickened its pace of rate hikes. Officials are becoming increasingly aggressive in their speeches, talking up the chances of as many as three or four rate hikes this year. And now, as revealed this week in the release of the March meeting minutes, policymakers are preparing to start shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet — which swelled from $1 trillion before the recession to some $4.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities now — as soon as this year.\n\nRelated: The Federal Reserve Bank, Explained\n\nThis is a big deal. The Fed's bond-buying programs — multiple rounds of \"quantitative easing\" and an \"Operation Twist\" — kept the bull market on track through multiple scares: the Eurozone debt crisis and \"flash crash\" in 2010; the 2011 U.S. credit rating downgrade; the 2012 Greek bailout; the 2013 \"fiscal cliff\" and government shutdown; and the 2014 Ebola scare and crude oil meltdown.\n\nInvestors have now been programmed to believe any major negative catalyst doesn't matter because, if things get really bad the Fed will step in. It's the \"Fed put\" in action — the trite name for the idea that prices will only be allowed to go so low.\n\nWhat's changed is that the Fed realizes that the job market is near maximum employment (with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and Baby Boomer retirements driving an ongoing tightening of the labor market) and inflation is reaching their target of a sustained 2 percent (with the PCE index now at 2.1 percent).\n\nMoreover, asset valuations have become a concern. Within the meeting minutes, it was noted that some members believed stock market valuations were \"quite high.\" This is a rare admittance for a body that, for years, has preferred to let the animal spirits roar. Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned of pockets of market froth back in 2014 — in biotech and big-tech stocks — but after a selloff resulted she quickly backed off her warning and hasn't repeated it since.\n\nRelated: Federal Reserve Inconsistent in Monitoring Big Banks, Auditors Say\n\nThe Shiller Price-to-Earnings ratio, which takes a 10-year average of earnings so as to smooth cyclicality, has only been higher than it is now heading into the 1929 and 2000 market bubble peaks. Bonds are pricey across the risk spectrum, both in terms of absolute yield and yield spreads. Farmland values are lofty. Global real estate has bounced back (especially in areas attracting Asian capital, like Vancouver, Canada).\n\nSave precious metals, pretty much everything is expensive right now, and the economy is running hot, especially if one considers the likelihood of simulative actions, including possible tax cuts and spending increases, by President Trump and Republicans in Congress. About half of the Fed policymakers have factored such stimulus into their forecasts.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economists expect the Fed to start drawing down its balance sheet once the federal funds rate hits a range of 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent, which would require another two quarter-point hikes, widely expected in June and September. That means a portfolio drawdown could start late in the year, possibly in December, and be slowly ramped up.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Will Determine if Stocks Rise or Fall\n\nThe result will likely be higher long-term interest rates, wider non-Treasury bond spreads (that is, higher mortgage and auto loan rates, for instance) and pressure on stocks as the discount rate rises. Also watch for a possible slowing of the debt-fueled corporate stock buyback bonanza as credit costs rise above equity earnings yields.\n\nOther likely effects include a drop in bank deposit balances and loan activity and a rise in the dollar that could pressure commodity prices as well as dollar-denominated foreign loans as funding gets more expensive.\n\nLong story short: Market volatility, which has been nearly extinguished by the Fed's ample liquidity, will make a return. After all, every bear market since the Fed was established in 1913 has been caused by tighter monetary policy."

    "text": "Sarin gas is a horrible nerve agent that should never be used on human beings. Even if one doesn't die from exposure, there could be permanent damage to the nervous system after even a short encounter with the life-altering chemical.\n\nBashar al-Assad, Syria's dictatorial leader, once again violated the Geneva convention by attacking his own people with this deadly nerve gas. He had used it before in neighborhoods where he claimed rebels were conspiring.\n\nRelated: Trump Acts on Obama’s “Red Line” by Launching Missiles at Syrian Targets\n\nThat's why President Obama drew that red line, challenging Assad not to cross it by using chemical weapons. Assad did cross that line during Obama's presidency, but Obama decided not to strike back, not even to send a message.\n\nThat message was sent Thursday by President Donald Trump who had been clearly shaken by images of small children gassed to death by the nerve agent. He ordered a surgical strike of the Syrian airfield that had launched the gas attack. And, he did it smartly. Fifty-nine tomahawk missiles launched from an aircraft carrier hit their target. At $1.59 million a piece, the attack cost the Defense Department $93,810,000.\n\nTrump called in leaders from both parties to alert them to the missile attack and why it was discreet. Russian soldiers in Syria were alerted shortly before the strike as well.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story used the wrong unit cost of each missile, $1.59 million is based on DoD FY2015 report."

    "text": "A week ago, administration officials said that ousting Syrian President Bashar al–Assad was no longer the U.S. priority. After Obama and then-Secretary of State Kerry argued this point for months with the Pentagon and the CIA, the Trump White House simply labeled the idea of removing Assad “silly.”\n\nNow it isn’t silly. In response to the chemical weapons attack in a rebel-held zone of northern Syria Tuesday, ousting Assad has returned as Trump’s policy priority. \"I think what Assad did is terrible,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One today. \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity, and he’s there, and I guess he’s running things, so something should happen.\"\n\nRelated: Russia Says Assad Did Not Use Chemicals, Defying Trump\n\nIt happened Thursday when the United States launched an estimated 59 cruise missiles at the Syrian military target that launched the deadly sarin gas attack against innocent men, women and children. The U.S. response happened more quickly than most expected, possibly surprising the Syrian military.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said today, “Assad’s role in the future is uncertain, and there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.” He went on to say that Assad would be removed by a political process of an international coalition and that those steps are already under way.\n\nWhen asked about U.S. military intervention, Tillerson said, “It’s a serious matter that deserves a serious response.” When UN Ambassador Nikki Haley told the Security Council Tuesday that the U.S. “may take our own action,” that seems to be what she meant.\n\nA vigorous response to the attack is imperative, most agree. How the U.S. responds could trigger a response from Russia. Or worse, Iran. Syria’s now a test for Trump’s foreign policy and military teams. The White House has already given the Pentagon more autonomy in the Middle East’s conflict zones.\n\nChina’s another test for Trump, and the exam started Thursday when President Xi Jinping arrived for a two-day summit at Mar–a–Lago. Secretary of State Tillerson smoothed the edges of Trump’s rough start with Xi when he visited Beijing a month ago. But it’s going to be an uncomfortable encounter: The two aren’t a match—not on personality and not on policy.\n\n“The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one,” Trump Tweeted last week. “We can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.”\n\nTrump has often had the wrong end of the stick with China, and he’s holding it again. China’s economy is expected to overtake the European Union’s by the end of this year. There are no alternatives for U.S. companies, which have somewhere between $50 billion and $80 billion (depending on which side is counting) invested on the ground in China.\n\nRelated: Tillerson says time for Russia to rethink support for Syria's Assad\n\nStrong domestic demand has been boosting China’s imports from the U.S. since the final quarter of 2015; exports to the U.S. have slowed, while Chinese investment in the U.S. hits one record after another. If the trade and investment accounts are headed in the right direction, it’s worse than pointless to face off with them.\n\nTrump’s other priority is to leverage economic ties to get Xi to put more pressure on North Korea. For a variety of reasons—political, diplomatic, strategic, economic—this holds zero potential. The Obama administration spent eight years proving this.\n\nTrump could have made his mark by improving on the pointlessly tense relationship Obama left him with, notably on the South China Sea issue. Instead, he’s on track to make Obama’s mistakes again and some of his own—worsening ties while getting little or nothing for it.\n\nOn NATO, Israel, Iran, and other questions, Trump’s rhetoric has proven one thing, his policy framework another: This administration’s more about continuity than change—and transformation is out of the question.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Chemical Attack In Syria Went 'Beyond A Red Line'\n\nThat’s a very mixed blessing. Trump’s verbal excesses will no longer threaten global stability and longstanding alliances. But the previous administration’s messes and failures were many, and Trump stands to miss a lot of opportunities to fix or at least improve on them.\n\nRelations with Russia are an outstanding question. Trump’s idea of a new “détente” with Moscow had supporters and critics in Washington; it could have opened the door to cooperation in areas of mutual interest. But the tragedy in Syria this week is the latest of many signs that Trump is going to stay with the acrimonious relationship that took root during the Obama years."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/06/Clock-Ticking-Government-Shutdown-5-Things-You-Need-Know",
    "text": "As Congress prepares to leave town for another break, the Senate has been focused on the effort to confirm (or deny) Neil Gorsuch as a justice of the Supreme Court. The GOP House is desperate to show some progress on the Republican promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But the urgent matter of making sure the federal government doesn’t have to shut down after the current Continuing Resolution under which it is authorized to spend money expires at midnight on April 28 is still on the back burner. That’s a problem because when lawmakers get back to town later this month, they aren’t going to have much time to solve a problem that has proved very tricky in the past.\n\nRelated: How Trump's Latest Twitter Tantrum Could Shut Down the Government\n\nWhere is everybody going?\n\nBoth houses of Congress are leaving town for “district work periods.” The House is leaving on what is generally referred to as a “two week” break, but at 18 days, it’s closer to three. When it returns, there are four scheduled “legislative days” before the federal government will be forced to shut down. The Senate, which doesn’t leave town until Friday, will have five legislative days to work before the federal government runs out of spending authority.\n\nWhat is expiring?\n\nCongress never managed to pass the spending bills necessary to authorize the departments of the executive branch to pay their bills and their employees’ salaries for Fiscal 2017, so since last fall, the government has been operating under a “Continuing Resolution” that allows spending set, for the most part, at levels established a year before.\n\nThat CR, as it is called, was renewed in December of last year, with an expiration date of April 28. At the time, then-Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers said, “[T]his type of short-term spending absolutely should not be the final answer to funding the federal government for the year. It is imperative that Congress complete its work on the remaining 11 Appropriations bills to ensure the proper and responsible use of tax dollars, to provide necessary resources for important programs and services, and to hold federal agencies accountable to the American people.”\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nSpoiler alert: It never happened.\n\nWhat happens if the CR expires?\n\nThe Constitution of the United States is pretty explicit on the topic. Article I, Section 9 says “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.” In other words, if there is no appropriation passed by Congress, it is generally illegal for the executive branch to spend money. That means that any government agency funded through the appropriations process -- and that’s most of them -- must shut down. An exception is made for people and offices that are deemed essential to protecting “the safety of human life or the protection of property.”\n\nIf the government shuts down, most federal employees would be allowed into the office briefly on the next workday to prepare for an orderly shutdown, but would afterward be barred from their places of employment until the shutdown ends.\n\nThen what?\n\nIt’s important to note that April 28 is a Friday, so by midnight on that day, most federal employees will have started their weekend, effectively giving Congress an extra two days before the full effects of the shutdown become apparent to most Americans.\n\nHowever, that’s no guarantee that there will be a speedy resolution. A dozen shutdowns dating back to the Reagan administration averaged five days in length, with many resolved in a single day. However, the last two -- under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, lasted 21 and 16 days, respectively.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\nCongress will eventually have to come to some sort of agreement to allow the government to continue spending money, but what that will look like is anybody’s guess.\n\nThe simplest method would be to authorize another CR, keeping spending locked at its current levels. But influential members of Congress, like Arizona Sen. John McCain, have promised to fight for a full year funding plan so that the armed forces can take advantage of proposed budget increases.\n\nAnother potential stumbling block is that more extreme members of Congress recognize that their leverage is greatly magnified in a crisis, and have in the past used moments like this to make extraordinary demands to secure their votes. Must-pass legislation like debt ceiling increases and appropriations bills have often been subject to attempts to tie them to things like defunding of the Affordable Care Act or making Planned Parenthood ineligible for federal funds.\n\nWhen will we know if a shutdown is coming?\n\nShutdown negotiations are, almost by definition, an exercise in political brinkmanship, so it will be no surprise of there is no resolution reached until late on the 28th or, given the buffer of the weekend, sometime before federal workers would be expected to show up on the following Monday morning.\n\nAs House members were getting ready to leave on Friday, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said that there were ongoing negotiations among the members of the Appropriations Committees. However, she told reporters, a daunting number of issues remained to resolve.\n\n“The number I know is 115,” Pelosi said, according to The Hill. “It went from 200 to 115, and now we’ll see.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/06/Obamacare-Repeal-Lives-GOP-Fiddles-Risk-Pools-Revised-Plan",
    "text": "In a last-minute effort to avoid going home to their constituents with nothing to show for their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans on Thursday were working on an amendment to their proposed alternative. A draft of the amendment making the rounds Thursday morning indicated that the aim is to create a new $15 billion reinsurance fund called the “Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program” to compensate insurance companies for covering people at high risk of incurring large medical costs.\n\nIn theory, the move would push premiums down for healthy individuals -- something the conservative House Freedom Caucus had been demanding -- by eliminating some of the risk within the universe of people covered by a particular insurer. However, the description of the plan in the brief amendment were so vague that it was difficult to know exactly how the program would work, especially given the confusion around whether the GOP plans to try to eliminate the ACA’s ban on discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that all non-smokers of the same age be offered identical coverage and pricing options.\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nIn general, when an insurer identifies a consumer within its coverage pool who presents a risk (or a certainty) of very high costs, they would be able to apply to the risk sharing program for assistance. The company would remit a percentage of the premiums paid by those individuals to the agency administering the risk sharing program in exchange for a promise to pay the insurer back for costs of covering that patient above a certain threshold.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the plan was being widely referred to as creating “risk pools,” but experts point out that risk pools have typically involved states or the federal government setting themselves up as insurers of last resort for high-risk patients. This proposal is more properly viewed as a “reinsurance” plan, in which the state promises to, in effect, insure the insurance companies.\n\nLike risk pools, the program would be designed to operate at a loss: insurers, on average, would be getting more money back in compensation than they paid in by transferring premium revenue to the program, with the government making up the difference.\n\nThe amendment being circulated Thursday would provide $15 billion over nine years to fund the program. But Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, warned that is not even close to the amount of money a program like this would likely cost.\n\nRelated: Looks Like the GOP Is Breaking Their Promise to Repeal and Replace Obamacare\n\n“Back in 2011 there were 35 states that had high-risk pools -- this program is a kind of cousin of high risk pools. The 35 state high risk pools combined covered a little over 200,000 people and the losses for those people was then about $1.2 billion per year.”\n\nIn 2011, a number of populous states including Ohio, Georgia, and North Carolina didn’t even have high-risk pools. In addition, many of the states that did have them imposed waiting periods, annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage, and enrollment caps in order to keep costs down. Most of those tactics were eliminated under the ACA, and would be politically difficult to reinstate.\n\nBottom line, Pollitz said, the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would be trying to cover many more people than the old risk pools did, and to do it without the cost control measures that those pools put in place.\n\n“It doesn’t add up,” she said, adding that for a program like this one, “$15 billion really isn’t a lot of money.”\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Could Flip-Flop on Obamacare and Save the Floundering Program\n\nIt was unclear on Thursday just how much the addition of the risk sharing program to the AHCA would change the math in the House, where conservative Republicans who wanted to pull the bill farther to the right and more moderate ones who were afraid it went too far currently have enough votes to prevent House leadership from assembling a majority in favor of the legislation. The bill currently has no Democratic support whatsoever.\n\nOn Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the change, “gets us closer together, closer to that consensus.” However, he added, “I want to be clear: we still have more work to do.”"

    "text": "The 2010 Decennial Census --the last time the government sought to count every person and household in the country -- proved to be a rocky and costly venture.\n\nChaotic operations and mounting staff needs drove the budget through the roof. Plans for census takers to use state-of-the-art, hand-held devices to record data in the field had to be scrapped when the devices proved unreliable. The Census Bureau had to quickly hire thousands of more workers and train them to record their findings the old fashion way -- on paper forms.\n\nRelated: Uncle Sam’s Environmental Cleanup Bill: $447 Billion and Rising\n\nAt the same time, the rate of return of census questionnaires by mail, historically the primary method of collecting data, sharply declined from 78 percent in 1970 to just 63 percent in 2010 -- a telltale sign of declining cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn the end, the 2010 Census proved to be the costliest census in U.S. history, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The $12.3 billion spent on that venture was 31 percent higher than the $9.4 billion cost of the 2000 Census, adjusted for inflation.\n\nIncredibly, the average cost for counting a single housing unit surged from about $16 in 1970 to roughly $92 in 2010, measured in 2020 constant dollars.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the 2020 Census operation now just a few years off is getting close scrutiny by government watchdogs and was included recently in the GAO’s latest report listing “high risk” government programs and agencies.\n\nThe 2020 Census was one of three programs or functions added to the list, along with management of federal programs that service Indian tribes and the federal government’s environmental liabilities. In all, there are 34 “high risk” governmental programs and areas that GAO asserts are particularly vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse or in dire need of “broad-based transformation.”\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog Tells Trump Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nThe decennial census unquestionably is one of the most important functions of the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau – a laborious and sometimes highly imprecise operation mandated by the Constitution.\n\nThe census generates vital information and data for the nation that is used -- among other things -- to reapportion the seats in the House of Representatives, realign the boundaries of legislative districts in every state, and provide invaluable social, demographic and economic profiles of the country essential in developing public policy and conducting research.\n\nThe data is also used by the federal government in allocating billions of dollars in federal financial assistance to state and local governments for highways construction, social services, grants and other assistance.\n\nAt a time when President Trump and his conservative allies are questioning the accuracy and validity of economic and scientific research, making sure that the Census Bureau conducts an accurate and smoothly run count will be of extreme importance.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe coming census will require the counting of an increasingly diverse and growing population of about 330 million people, according to the Commerce Department. Census takers will be attempting to contact and interview people in more than 140 million housing units.\n\nTo get an accurate count, the Census Bureau must build an accurate address list for every housing unit, find ways to maximize the number of people taking it upon themselves to respond to requests for information, and then follow up with people and families that don’t respond.\n\nThe 2017 Commerce Department budget plan for the 2020 Census will include “sweeping design changes in four key areas:\n\nNew methodologies to conduct address canvassing.\n\nInnovative ways of optimizing self-response.\n\nThe use of administrative records to reduce the nonresponse workload.\n\nAnd the use of technology to replace manual tasks.\n\nCommerce officials believe the new approaches will save the government more than $5 billion compared to the previous census costs. Yet given past costly snafus and mission creep, there is no assurance the 2020 census will cost far more than the last one.\n\nThe challenges will be many – not the least of which will be overcoming the reluctance of many undocumented immigrants to cooperate with a census taker when immigration agents are rounding up illegal immigrants for deportation.\n\nWith the Trump administration pressing for major cuts in most domestic programs to offset the cost of a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year, the Census Bureau could feel increased pressure to curtail spending and hiring.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nStill, the administration signaled in its new budget proposal the need to get the census right. While the White House Budget Office proposed a 16 percent overall cut in the Commerce Department’s spending in 2018, it provided $1.5 billion for the Census Bureau – an increase of more than $100 million from the previous year to continue to prepare for the new census.\n\n“This additional funding prioritizes fun­damental investments in information technology and field infrastructure, which would allow the bureau to more effectively administer the 2020 Decennial Census,” Trump’s budget document declared.\n\nIn 2010, the bureau operated 506 census offices throughout the country with 550,000 staff on the ground. Last year, the bureau floated a “cost effective” census-taking plan for 2020 with as few as 150 offices nationwide and just 200,000 staffers.\n\n“A complete count of the nation's population is an enormous challenge as the Bureau seeks to control the cost of the census while it implements several new innovations and manages the processes of acquiring and developing new and modified information technology (IT) systems supporting them,” the GAO said in its recent report on “high risk” government operations. However, the GAO added, it’s time for the Census Bureau to get on the stick and make improvements before the next census is upon us.\n\nOver the past three years, the GAO has made 30 recommendations to help the Bureau design and implement a more cost-effective census for 2020. So far, only six of them had been fully implemented as of January."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/06/Infrastructure-Trump-Gives-New-York-Times-Master-Class-Evasion",
    "text": "Donald Trump’s sit-down interview with The New York Times on Wednesday mostly gained attention because of the president’s evidence-free assertion that he believes former Obama administration National Security Adviser Susan Rice committed a crime by asking for the identities of some Trump associates who were caught up in intelligence monitoring and his decision to defend Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in the face of multiple sexual assault settlements.\n\nHowever, the interview was fascinating for another reason, too. The Times sent two extremely experienced reporters, Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush, to talk to Trump about his plans to revamp the nation’s infrastructure, something the president campaigned on and even added to his inaugural address, promising, “We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.”\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Still Doesn’t Understand the Unemployment Rate\n\nBut despite multiple attempts to get the president to provide some details about his intentions, Haberman and Thrush came away with virtually nothing.\n\nHaberman began by asking Trump to provide the “broad outlooks” of the plan.\n\nTrump: We want to do a great infrastructure plan, and on that side, I will say that we’re going to have, I believe, tremendous Democrat support. We are also going to have some good Republican support, and I think it’s going to be one of the very bipartisan bills and it’s going to happen. I may put it in with health care.\n\nHaberman: Really?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. I may put it in with something else because it’s a very popular thing. We’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, as of two months ago. Uh, $6 trillion. And yet we can’t fix our own roads and our own highways. And our bridges, which are, in many cases, in very bad shape. And we’re going to have a very big infrastructure plan. And bill. And it’s going to come soon. And I think we’ll have support from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\nThe interview would go on this way at length, with the Times reporters pressing Trump for details and getting back a stream of adjectives (Great! Tremendous!) offering no actual detail before veering wildly away from the actual topic at hand.\n\nHere’s what happened when Thrush then Haberman, after being told that Trump was considering an “acceleration” of the infrastructure plan, asked for details about the timing.\n\nHABERMAN: What’s your time frame, at this point, that you’re looking at as an accelerated?\n\nTRUMP: Well, we’re working — you know when people said, when you guys, because you know we have a very solid administration. We have some very, very good people. This man was the president of Goldman Sachs. I mean, he was, like, the president of Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor reasons that are unclear -- other than perhaps a reluctance or inability to actually answer the question, Trump was directing attention to one of his top advisers, former investment banker Gary Cohn. The conversation never made it back to timing.\n\nRelated: The Art of an F-35 Deal: Did Trump Engineer a Lockheed-Boeing Pact?\n\nThen there was the question of money. Trump always refers to the infrastructure proposal as a “trillion dollar” plan but has never really explained where that money will come from or how it will be directed. Some guidance coming from the administration suggests that the idea is to offer a few hundred billions of dollars in tax credits in order to stimulate $1 trillion in private sector investment.\n\nThrush tried to pin Trump down on an actual number. Once:\n\nTHRUSH: We’ve heard some outlines in the press — how much public money versus tax credits are we talking about?\n\nTRUMP: We may go public/private on some deals. We’re going to do a very big — you know, the money that was squandered by the past administrations. Squandered on airplane routing systems that don’t work. That, you know — what would you call the actual system itself?\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nTwice:\n\nTHRUSH: Well, how much money in total? There are numbers that have been floating around. It’s two to three hundred billion over 10 years of federal aid.\n\nTRUMP: No. More than that. Much more than that.\n\nTHRUSH: How much more?\n\nTRUMP: We’re talking about a trillion-dollar infrastructure.\n\nTHRUSH: But I mean, in terms of actual —\n\nTRUMP: We may take that trillion, and we may also, in addition, use public/private. But we’re talking about an investment of a trillion dollars.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nThree times:\n\nTHRUSH: Can we bookmark that for one second? I just want to ask you about — O.K. Tax credits versus actual money on the table, federal money. You say a trillion total. The estimates out there are two to three hundred billion in federal expenditures as opposed to tax credits. Are those numbers accurate? Give me a general account.\n\nTRUMP: Nothing is accurate now because we haven’t made a final determination. We haven’t made a determination as to public/private. There are some things that work very nicely public/private. There are some things that don’t. The federal government, we’re doing very well you saw, a lot of good numbers coming out. You saw our imports. You saw what happened with China. And various other people that this country has been dealing with over the years. You saw the numbers come out today, they’re very promising. Lots of good numbers are coming out. We are borrowing very inexpensively. When you can borrow so inexpensively, you don’t have to do the public/private thing. Because public/private can be very expensive. When you go equity, when you give equity to people who own your highways essentially for a 30-year period, who own your tollbooths for a period of time — come on in, Mike! You know Mike and Reince?\n\nAnd came away empty at each attempt.\n\nRelated: Looks Like the GOP Is Breaking Their Promise to Repeal and Replace Obamacare\n\nLikewise, Trump wouldn’t name a single project that he would consider a “signature” element of the infrastructure plan. Nor would he touch the question of whether the plan would seek to avoid the federal law requiring federal contractors pay workers the prevailing local wage for the kind of work they are doing.\n\nCould he give them a hint? Haberman asked.\n\n“No,” Trump replied, as the interview ended. “It’s an important question, actually. It’s going to be good.”"

The $122 million jets are designed for short takeoff and vertical landing, which makes them operational from amphibious assaults ships – referred to as “Lightning carriers” in this scenario.\n\nThe 2017 Marine Corps Aviation Plan says that by 2025, the service will have 185 F-35Bs that could populate its fleet of amphibious assault ships. “While the amphibious assault ship will never replace the aircraft carrier,” the outline of where Marine aviation is headed said, “it can be complementary if employed in imaginative ways.”\n\nThe plan, released late last month, goes on to say, “A Lightning Carrier, taking full advantage of the amphibious assault ship as a sea base, can provide the naval and joint force with significant access, collection and strike capabilities.”\n\nA story on the website of the U.S. Naval Institute said that “the Lightning Carrier concept includes an amphibious assault ship carrying 16 to 20 F-35Bs with four MV-22 Ospreys to refuel them.” Such ships could operate independently as a component of an expeditionary force or could be “part of a Carrier Strike Group [that would include] a Navy aircraft carrier and guided-missile cruisers and destroyers.”\n\nWhile amphibious ships may never have to be deployed as Lightning carriers, the Marine Corps plan says that to not develop “this capability” would be to ignore a “force multiplier.”\n\nAmong the benefits of such a scenario, Lightning carriers would be smaller targets for the “carrier killer” missiles being developed by China and Russia.\n\nAnother benefit is cost. While the new America-class amphibious assault ships aren’t cheap at $3.4 billion each, they cost a lot less than a full-size flattop. And they don’t skimp on firepower. Maj. John Dirk, an F-35 test pilot, said that the Lightning carrier produces \"the most powerful concentration of combat power ever put to sea in the history of the world.\""

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/06/Susan-Rice-and-Media-Will-Only-Investigate-Republicans",
    "text": "For months, the media has demonstrated an insatiable – and understandable – appetite for the story of potential Russian interference in American politics during the 2016 election cycle. Demands for investigations into whether people in the Donald Trump campaign had contact or coordinated with Russian intel operatives have resulted in probes at the FBI as well as in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe stakes for US security and global standing are obviously high, and the need for accountability in governance may never be greater. This potential scandal will almost certainly wind up as one of the most-watched stories of 2017 – and deservedly so.\n\nOddly, though, media curiosity does not appear to extend equally in all directions. Some of the sources for the concerns over political interference come from leaked transcripts of conversations apparently monitored by the National Security Agency (NSA), an agency with heavy restrictions on surveillance involving domestic communications, especially when involving “US persons” – American citizens and legal residents at home or abroad.\n\nFBI Turns Up the Heat on Russian Election Hacking Investigation\n\nBefore the passage of the Patriot Act and its controversial Section 702, the NSA could not collect such data even if incidentally captured. Since then, it has become permissible in some circumstances, but analysts redact the names of those inadvertently captured from transcripts of such conversations unless a specific FISA warrant allows for their collection. The fact sheet for Section 702 published by the NSA to argue for its renewals every five years notes that dissemination of surveillance data involving US persons is prohibited in all but a narrow set of circumstances:\n\n\n\nThe dissemination of any information about U.S. persons is expressly prohibited unless it is necessary to understand foreign intelligence or assess its importance; is evidence of a crime, or indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\n\n\nEven then, that information would be only disseminated to agencies with jurisdiction over those issues, not publicly released. The leaking of transcripts identifying Michael Flynn in a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergei Kirlyak in December did not meet any of those conditions, and neither did subsequent leaks of similar material naming other US persons. This led Republicans in Congress to demand investigations into the leaks themselves; FBI director James Comey declined to tell Congress whether such an investigation was underway. Rep. Trey Gowdy demanded an investigation, calling the leaks “the felonious dissemination of classified material.”\n\nThat brings us back to one big question: how did the names of US persons get back into the transcripts in the first place, after being redacted? When former national security advisor Susan Rice was asked by PBS two weeks ago about incidental surveillance of Trump campaign members, she demurred on the topic altogether. “I know nothing about this,” Rice replied. “I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.”\n\nHowever, Bloomberg’s Eli Lake reported that not only did Rice know about the collection of this data, she specifically requested to be provided the unredacted transcripts – and had done so as a “pattern” discovered by the National Security Council. While those requests fall within the jurisdiction of a national security advisor, it flatly contradicted what Rice had claimed to PBS in March. When confronted with Lake’s reporting, Rice cemented the contradiction, claiming that although she had seen the transcripts, “I leaked nothing to nobody.”\n\nRelated: Trump Told the New York Times that Susan Rice Might Have Committed a Crime\n\nThat’s quite the memory boost in a two-week span, but strangely enough, media outlets began rushing to let Rice off the hook. At CNN alone, Jim Sciutto assured viewers that a source “close to Rice” insists that there was nothing to this story, and both Sciutto and anchor Don Lemon proclaimed it a “diversion” from the Trump-Russia scandal. Fellow anchor Chris Cuomo called it “fake news.” The Washington Post declared it “ginned-up … a fake scandal.”\n\nNBC News argued that Rice couldn’t have gotten the transcripts without permission from the agencies, an explanation that didn’t explain why she just didn’t explain that when first asked. The New York Times buried mention of Rice’s extraordinary flip-flop on page A16, prompting a round of laughter from the panel on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday, and a provocative question from host Joe Scarborough.\n\n“What if Dick Cheney had asked for the unmasking of names for Barack Obama’s incoming administration?” Scarborough continued, “There are a lot of things we don’t know. A lot of questions we don’t know. I do know this, though, I heard the hallelujah chorus come and immediately on cue last night saying…nothing to see here. Move along, move along.”\n\nRelated: Major Donor Set Up Secret Meeting to Create Trump-Putin Back Channel\n\nThis display of aggressive incuriosity was all the more remarkable given its immediacy. Not only did the national media want to instruct people to ignore Lake’s report, but they also wanted to make sure they were seen as completely unwilling to ask questions on the basis of it. Rather than investigate it and ask tough questions of former Obama administration officials about the approval and dissemination process that gave Rice access to unredacted information about US persons, they wanted to paint the questions themselves as illegitimate.\n\nFurthermore, every one of these pushbacks painted the Rice story as an either/or decision for coverage with the Trump-Russia probe. Major media outlets can cover more than one story at a time, however, and the possibility that an administration might have used intelligence data for political purposes would be just as big a story – if not perhaps even bigger. That, after all, was a key component in the Watergate scandal that brought down the Richard Nixon presidency, a scandal largely uncovered under media pressure.\n\nPerhaps further investigation would demonstrate that Rice and other Obama administration officials did not use intelligence for political purposes. The information from those unredacted transcripts got leaked by someone, though, and Rice is the first major figure known to have accessed them outside of the agencies that collected the data in the first place. After having demonstrated such drive to connect dots between Russians and Trump, the lack of curiosity from the same media to follow up on such an obvious lead on a major leak lends itself to the conclusion that the media only has an interest in intrigue when it involves Republicans."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/05/IRS-Chief-Warns-Budget-Cuts-Could-Cost-US-Billions",
    "text": "Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen on Wednesday offered a bleak assessment of what will happen to the national debt if his agency continues to face funding shortfalls and is prevented from replacing most of the employees who retire or leave for other reasons. The end result, he predicted, will be lower rates of compliance, less revenue for the federal government and larger federal budget deficits.\n\nKoskinen, who came out of retirement to take over the agency four years ago, was speaking at the National Press Club in Washington when he reminded his audience that the IRS has been operating under a virtual hiring freeze since 2011, which left the agency powerless to replace the 17,000 employees who have left government service since then.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Sales Taxes\n\nThe agency’s enforcement arm has been particularly hard hit, he said. As an example, he noted that the ranks of revenue officers -- people who go out into the field to find delinquent taxpayers and arrange for them to make payments -- has been cut by more than half since 1996. There were 7,400 revenue officers 20 years ago, compared to only 3,500 now. This is despite the fact that the number of annual tax returns filed by Americans has gone up many millions over the same period.\n\nKoskinen said that the percentage of taxpayers who are audited on an annual basis is at a decade-long low. He warned that continued cuts that make it difficult for the IRS to do its job extend well beyond a revenue shortfall.\n\n“If someone who is paying their fair share of taxes sees other who don’t, and those others get away with it, that taxpayer may be a lot less motivated to be tax compliant the next time around,” he said. “If the situation continues, the risk is to the nation’s overall compliance rate.”\n\nHe added, “As the notion takes hold that the tax system is unfair, reversing that notion and the decline of the compliance rate won’t be easy to do.”\n\nKoskinen’s appearance came just a few weeks after the Trump administration released a budget plan that called for major cuts to IRS funding. He expressed hope that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would try to defend the agency’s funding in the White House, arguing that when an investor purchases an existing business, “You don’t look at the revenue arm and say, ‘I think I’ll starve it of funds and see how it does.’”\n\nRelated: How GOP Conservatives Could Make Tax Reform Impossible\n\n“We’ll have a real problem if the IRS doesn’t have enough employees to help people figure out what they owe or to fairly enforce the tax code,” he said. “And the impact will be on the ability of the government to fund itself. A one percent drop [in compliance] translates into more than $30 billion a year in lost revenues. Think about what a loss of $300 billion over 10 years would do to the federal deficit.”\n\nKoskinen also noted that he would be leaving the IRS in November, when his term as commissioner expires. The 77-year-old, who has been facing demands that he resign or be impeached by House Republicans angry at how he dealt with an investigation into the agency’s treatment of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt non-profit status, did not seem sorry to be leaving.\n\n“Next year at this time, with any luck, there will be a new commissioner,” he said. “Although I still have several months to go as commissioner, I’ve encouraged the administration to search for a candidate who can follow me as soon as possible.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/05/Trump-s-Pick-Head-FDA-Too-Close-Big-Pharma",
    "text": "President Trump has been pressing for proposals to lower prescription drug prices to the point that he has begun conferring with a senior Democratic lawmaker on ways to prevent the pharmaceutical industry from “getting away with murder” in their pricing practices.\n\nWhile Trump has yet to unveil concrete proposals for addressing the problem, during the campaign he proposed allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries to enhance competition. He also favors allowing Medicare officials to negotiate prices with the major drug companies by eliminating a non-negotiating ban.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nIronically, Trump’s choice to head the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dr. Scott Gottlieb, worked as a consultant for the pharmaceutical industry for years and was a sharp critic of those proposals during the 2016 presidential campaign. “The Trump plan—while perhaps good politics—will offer consumers little relief,” Gottlieb wrote in a March 2016 commentary in Forbes.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Wednesday morning, Gottlieb repeatedly ducked questions about his views on drug importation and strengthening Medicare officials’ hands in negotiating lower prices.\n\nPressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on whether he would now get behind Trump on these and other schemes for dealing with runaway drug costs that add billions of dollars in costs to consumers and federal health agencies, the typically expansive Gottlieb demurred by saying that drug prices weren’t the responsibility of the FDA.\n\n“Senator, it’s true I have written a lot of things on a lot of different subjects including issues around Medicare [drug pricing],” Gottlieb said. “I think I’m coming before you for the position at FDA and I’m going to get asked my position on a lot of different subjects that fall outside FDA’s purview. I think I would be doing the agency I hope to lead no favors by wading into other territory.”\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nGottlieb is technically correct that the FDA’s principal mandate is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products and medical devices and ensuring the safety of the country’s food supply. But as Sanders noted, the agency’s stated mission is also to make medicine “more effective, safer and more affordable.”\n\nGottlieb said he shared those goals, but that drew a rejoinder from Sanders, a major proponent of both drug importation and strengthening Medicare’s bargaining hand: “But your goal is, from what I’m hearing, you oppose the ideas that President Trump told he was going to do for the American people. It sounds a little strange to me.”\n\nGottlieb, 44, is a clinical assistant professor at New York University’s School of Medicine and a resident fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI).\n\nLast year, Gottlieb complained in a post on the Brookings Institution website about what he described as “political pressure” to enact policies giving federal and state government authority to set drug prices or limit price increase. Trump and many Democrats at the time were pressing to grant Medicare the same authority that the Veterans’ Administration and Medicaid have to directly negotiate with drug companies to contain or bring down drug costs.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nGottlieb wrote that “these policies could have the unintended consequences of reducing the incentive to develop more effective drugs.”\n\nOn the issue of drug importation, Trump strongly supported that idea throughout the campaign. He recently met with Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, about legislation that Cummings and Sanders are promoting to allow drug importation and enhance Medicare’s drug price bargaining clout.\n\nGottlieb argued in a March 2016 commentary in Forbes that the added costs of regulating imported drugs would practically erase any net savings to the government. Moreover, he argued, foreign countries would have no incentive to sell cheaper drugs to the U.S. or ensure their safety.\n\nSanders, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and other Democrats are highly suspicious of Gottlieb and his ability to be objective in regulating a prescription drug industry. Gottlieb, a one-time FDA official, has spent most of his career working as a consultant to the drug and health care industry – raising obvious questions about the potential for conflicts of interest. The New York Times recently reported that Gottlieb was paid millions of dollars in consulting fees over the years.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nAs a condition of his nomination, Gottlieb has promised to recuse himself for a year from any FDA decisions involving about 20 health care companies he has worked for.\n\nDuring his testimony this morning before the committee chaired by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Gottlieb suggested there were a number of things the FDA could do to spur more competition – possibly by speeding up the review of less expensive generic drugs and thwarting efforts by major drug companies to game the system by seeking anti-competitive regulatory changes\n\n“I think this is a problem that I am uniquely suited to try to look at and solve because of my background – because I understand how companies have tried to game the process in the past,” he said.\n\n“It’s not illegal to try to use the regulatory process to gain commercial advantage,” he added. “We should try to design policies that prevent those abuses because we don’t want to be playing ‘whack-a-mole’ with companies and going after them one by one. What I want is a framework in place that prevents those kinds of things from happening so that people can’t use the regulatory process as a commercial arbitrage to gain unfair advantages.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/05/Will-Most-Conservative-Republicans-Congress-Scuttle-Tax-Reform-Too",
    "text": "House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows made some news last month when, just days after his group helped kill the health care reform bill favored by House leadership and the Trump administration, he signaled that they would be open to compromise on a tax reform bill by not insisting that tax cuts be offset by replacement revenue or spending cuts. But on Tuesday he made it clear that the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus’s willingness to cooperate comes with conditions and a not-so-subtle reminder that what the Caucus members did to the American Health Care Act can be done to any tax reform bill.\n\nSpecifically, Meadows insisted that unlike the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, any tax reform bill would have to be written with the active participation of the Freedom Caucus. The failed AHCA, by contrast, was written in virtual secrecy, and members only learned of its details through the media.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\n“When a member sees the text for the first time in a leaked draft from Politico, therein is a problem,” he said late Monday, as the GOP worked in vain to revive the health care bill.\n\nThe structure of the House Republican majority is such that, when the Freedom Caucus signals that it has a problem, that means House leadership also has a problem. Republicans hold a comfortable majority in the House if they all stick together, but the Freedom Caucus has, over the years, demonstrated a willingness to walk away from legislation supported by the majority of the House GOP if it doesn’t meet their standards of ideological purity. Because its three dozen members are enough to deprive the GOP of a majority on the House floor, when that happens, Republican legislation crafted without Democratic support dies.\n\nWhile it may seem only sensible for House leadership to make sure the Freedom Caucus has a seat at the table as they try to write a bill overhauling the tax code, the danger is that including them in advance means the bill dies a slow, lingering death rather than a relatively quick one, like the AHCA’s.\n\nThe default Freedom Caucus position on issues it considers vital tends to be maximalist and uncompromising, as House leadership re-learned during the battle over the AHCA. The group’s hardcore members were unwilling to support a bill that gave them most of what they wanted\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nFormer Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan has already come out against something expected to be a major element of any plan backed by House leadership: a border adjustment tax that would benefit US exporters and penalize importers. His objection to it is seemingly not grounded in policy, per se, so much as in a blanket unwillingness to create a new tax, even in the context of reform that would do away with other kinds of taxes.\n\n“My reasoning is very basic,” Jordan said in an interview with The Atlantic. “Why in the world would we want to add another revenue stream?...We come at it from a fundamental perspective. The idea that you’re going to add an entirely new tax is a big problem.”\n\nIf it turns out that being “at the table” just means that the Freedom Caucus can start presenting its ultimatums earlier in the negotiation, including them is likely a recipe for another legislative failure, albeit one that plays out over months rather than weeks.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nThe real wild card here is public opinion. President Trump has already shown his willingness to attack Freedom Caucus members on social media, and while that didn’t have much of an effect on them during the health care debate, it’s conceivable that if a tax reform proposal can be presented as a major tax cut for Middle America that still keeps popular government programs in place (a dubious prospect, but still,) the politics could change.\n\nAs Molly E. Reynolds of the Brookings Institution points out, “The [House Freedom Caucus] may find the politics of opposing tax reform on principle more difficult than their obstruction on health care. So we’ll have to wait and see.”"

    "text": "Hopes that the House Republicans would reach a compromise that could allow them to vote on a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act before leaving town for recess at the end of the week -- never very realistic in the first place -- are fading as lawmakers appear unable to find enough common ground between the party’s hard right and its less doctrinaire members.\n\nIn a late-night meeting that dragged on for two hours Tuesday, members of the Republican conference appeared to make little substantial progress on the plan, meaning that lawmakers will likely have to go home and face constituents having failed to keep their promise to do away with President Obama’s signature domestic achievement.\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nThe main problem continues to be the demands from the far-right House Freedom Caucus that any repeal bill must eliminate various requirements the ACA placed on health insurance providers who sell policies to consumers who receive government subsidies for their coverage.\n\nFreedom Caucus members argue that the requirements, including coverage of “essential” health benefits and the premiums that are based solely on the age of the consumer and not health status, have driven up costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the divide between the Freedom Caucus and Republicans who want to see some of the basic protections in the ACA kept in place appeared only to widen. Freedom Caucus members have been touting a plan that would devolve much of the decision-making to the states, through a system that would allow them to individually opt out of some of the law’s requirements.\n\nAmong the things the states would be allowed to opt out of is what’s known as “community rating.” That’s a system under which everyone in the same age cohort is charged the same amount for their insurance, regardless of whether or not they have a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe elimination of discrimination on the basis of a preexisting condition is one of the most popular elements of the ACA, and even the most conservative lawmakers are worried about getting rid of it outright. But it comes at a price for everyone who has to pay some of those costs, whether they're sick or not. But the elimination of community rating would do so through the back door by allowing insurers to raise premiums on people with preexisting conditions so much that they are effectively priced out of the market.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus would like to shift sicker consumers onto state-run high-risk insurance pools subsidized by the federal government, in order to bring down costs for healthy people buying insurance on the open market. More moderate Republicans are balking at the plan, worried that it would have the effect of limiting coverage for vulnerable Americans.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after last night’s meeting in the Capitol, Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows, of North Carolina, tried to put a positive spin on the negotiations, even as he was forced to admit that there was no real agreement within the Republican conference on how to move forward.\n\n“There were no agreements tonight, and no agreements in principle, and certainly no agreements in terms of a foundation,” he said, according to The Washington Post. “There was a general agreement that the progress we’re making is certainly progress, and there are good discussions, but understanding that there’s a whole lot of things that we have to work out.”\n\nRelated: Health Secretary Tom Price’s Latest Shady Deal Is a Serious Conflict of Interest\n\nThe meeting included high-level representatives from the White House, including Vice President Mike Pence and Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, as well as senior members of the House leadership team and representatives of the Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee and the members of the more moderate “Tuesday Group.”\n\nIf there was a bright spot for the GOP, it was that members of the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group were in the same room together. Reports earlier in the day suggested that some members of the more moderate wing of the party didn’t want to even bother discussing matters with their more hard-right colleagues."

    "text": "No state has defaulted on its public debt since the 1930s. Despite many near misses more recently, the possibility of any state going under financially is remote at best.\n\nYet a senior official at S&P Global Ratings, a premier government credit rating agency, warned on Tuesday that nearly a dozen states with festering budget problems and woefully underfunded employee pension programs are struggling through “chronic budget stress” that could push them to the brink.\n\nStates Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem: Here Are the Worst 10\n\n“This long period of relative calm may have lulled some people into complacency when it comes to state finances [but] it shouldn’t have,” Gabriel Petek, a managing director and expert on state finances at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in The Hill. “We now see a profound shift unfolding in states such as Illinois, Kentucky and New Jersey, whose pension systems are funded at distressed levels.”\n\nSince January 2016, S&P Global Ratings has issued 11 state credit rating downgrades and only two upgrades. States that received negative ratings or “outlooks” ranged from Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota to Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas and New Mexico. But far and away the three most problematic states are New Jersey, Illinois and Kentucky.\n\nIn October 2016, for instance, S&P Global Ratings dropped Illinois' credit rating one notch to BBB, virtually junk bond status and the lowest rating of any state. S&P warned that the rating could fall even further unless Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and his Democratic opponents in the state legislature come to an agreement on a long-term solution to Illinois’ chronic budget deficit and pension problems.\n\nThe impasse is so great that the two sides have been unable to agree on a new budget for nearly two years.\n\nRelated: Illinois Is Not Alone: States Facing $1 Trillion Pension Shortfall\n\nLast November, S&P Global Ratings downgraded New Jersey’s credit rating from “A” to “A-minus” after citing the state's struggling pension system and a recent, ill-conceived deal between Republican Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic lawmakers to cut more than $1 billion in taxes at a time when the state lacked sufficient revenue to cover its obligations.\n\nThe nation’s three top credit rating agencies -- S&P, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors -- have now downgraded New Jersey for a total of 10 times. Christie, an unsuccessful 2016 Republican presidential candidate who was later passed over by President Trump for a cabinet post, is struggling to hold the state together financially before he leaves office.\n\nFinally, last January, S&P raised a red flag regarding Kentucky’s $32.6 billion public pension debt. The credit rating agency revised its outlook on Kentucky from stable to negative, just as the state was getting ready to hold a bond sale.\n\nThe lowered outlook reflected the reasonable likelihood that S&P would further lower the rating sometime over the next two years, making it more expensive for Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and the state government to borrow.\n\nMany factors have adversely impacted state finances. For instance, low oil prices help to explain fiscal gaps for the leading energy states, such as Alaska, North Dakota and Oklahoma. Moreover, slower revenue growth, declining worker-to-beneficiary ratios in state retirement systems, and rising Medicaid enrollments “are widespread and have meant that fiscal stress is no longer confined to recessionary times,” Petek wrote.\n\nRelated: States Keep Using Gimmicks to ‘Balance’ Their Budgets\n\n“This stress is leading states to forego crucially needed investment in infrastructure and higher education,” he added.\n\nAlthough a handful of states including West Virginia, New York and Indiana have made important strides in reducing major shortfalls in their employee pension plans, many others are just treading water or losing ground, as The Fiscal Times reported last year. A study by the Pew Charitable Trust renewed its warning about a widening gap between assets and obligations.\n\nState-run retirement systems reported shortfalls totaling $934 billion in fiscal 2014, the latest figures available, which was a slight improvement over the $969 billion deficit from the previous year. Many states were fortunate to make smart investments to chip away at their pension fund shortfalls. Others were not so fortunate.\n\nTo be sure, says Petek, states continue to benefit from certain “inherent advantages” that result in mostly high credit ratings and low borrowing costs. Among these advantages are legally imposed controls against financial excess such as balanced-budget requirements and limits on borrowing.\n\nRelated: Anti-Tax GOP Governors Find It Hard to Hold the Line\n\nStill, states face “asymmetric” budget challenges, according to Petek. While the budgetary gains to states during the current expansion have been relatively modest, “recent downdrafts have been severe.” State revenue trends over the past half-century illustrate the problem. Between 1951 and 2001, state revenues received the aggregate never showed year-over-year declines – all in all, a stellar performance.\n\nYet aggregate revenues have shown year-over-year decline three times in the past 15 years. The sharpest decline occurred in 2009 when aggregate revenues dropped 8.5 percent.\n\nWith a new Republican president and Congress seeking deep cuts in most domestic spending to offset a major boost in spending for defense and homeland security, Petek cautions that states likely must “go it alone” the next time a recession strikes.\n\n“In our view, it’s unlikely that in a downturn the current Congress would deliver enhanced aid to states via Medicaid as previous Congresses did in response to the last two recessions,” he wrote."

Surprise – it’s not the GOP.\n\nThe Donnybrook over the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court makes it clear: the Extreme Left has hijacked the Democratic Party. That’s a tragedy for Democrats, and for the country. It guarantees continued paralysis in Washington, which will prompt the Trump White House to act through executive orders and regulations, just like President Obama. That, in turn, will harden positions and extend the cycle of divisive politics.\n\nWhat will it take to break this vicious pattern? A natural disaster? A terror attack? North Korea using its nuclear arsenal? The possibilities are too grim to consider. There is a better way, but Democrats can’t see it, so blinded are they by their hatred of President Trump.\n\nRelated: The Gorsuch Vote Will Show the Democrats Can’t Govern, Either\n\nIf Democrats could pause for breath, they would realize something that frightens a good many conservatives –- Donald Trump is not an ideologue. He doesn’t care about (or even understand the nuances of) the abortion issue, for instance, but he positioned himself as pro-life because that’s what his conservative followers demanded.\n\nAs an elderly cab driver in D.C. said to me recently, “Donald Trump isn’t a Republican or a Democrat. He just wants to fix things.” He is completely right, but the geniuses in the opposition don’t get it.\n\nTrump has not made any secret of his unorthodoxy. He is “fine” with same-sex marriage, he says, and not interested in reviewing the Supreme Court decision that legalized such unions. He is open to granting legal status to people in the country illegally, a stance which is anathema to conservatives and surprising to many in light of his push to close our southern border. He is also content to protect many provisions of Obamacare, much to the horror of the Freedom Caucus folks, who want to roll the clock back.\n\nNot only is Trump not a staunch conservative, he is pliable. Sit him down in the Oval Office with President Obama for ninety minutes and suddenly he’s got “great respect” for his predecessor; three days later he’s promising to protect popular parts of Obamacare, after earlier vowing to shred the unpopular program.\n\nRelated: McConnell Prepared to Invoke ‘Nuclear Option’ to Confirm Gorsuch\n\nCan’t Democrats turn these Trump traits to their advantage? Find a way to work with the man? The Trump White House isn’t off-limits to Democrats; they will be welcomed by Gary Cohn, for instance, a long-time Dem who is Trump’s National Economic Council Director. Chuck Schumer should find common ground with Special Advisor Jared Kushner, for heaven’s sake; Kushner helped fund Schumer’s campaign! Or how about Dina Powell, Deputy National Security Advisor, who is said to be close to Valerie Jarrett and other Dems – isn’t she a plausible ally?\n\nPolling shows that most of the country (specifically, 63 percent of likely voters according to Rasmussen) would prefer Democrats to knock off their petulant resistance to all things Trump, and work with the White House to fix the nation’s problems. Unfortunately, the leadership of the Democratic Party doesn’t see it that way; they think they can rebuild their party’s influence by blocking the Trump agenda, even if it means losing forever those blue-collar voters that went rogue in the last election.\n\nIt’s a mistake. By following the lead of Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, two of the most strident voices in the party, Democrats are abandoning their moderate voters. In the midst of Michael Flynn’s chaotic downfall, people said they would vote for a generic Democrat over the president (43 percent to 35 percent). But given a head-to-head match-up with Senator Warren, they chose Trump by a wide (42 percent to 36 percent) margin. That is telling.\n\nRelated: Early Signs of ‘Nuclear Warfare’ in Clashes Over Trump’s Cabinet Picks\n\nNot only are Democrats further severing their ties with swing-state voters who objected to Obama’s progressive agenda, their so-called “resistance” isn’t even filling their coffers. The FEC reports that despite upheaval in the Trump White House and sinking approval ratings, the Republican National Committee raised $9.5 million last month, compared to $6.4 million hauled in by the Democratic National Committee. To date this year, GOP campaign committees have collected nearly $60 million, far outpacing Dems, who have raked in only $36.6 million.\n\nSo why persist in behavior that isn’t yielding any discernible results? Democrats fear they will fall prey to the same forces that felled many mainstream Republicans in the early Obama years. They're worried they will be challenged from the Left, as many Republican incumbents were deposed by Tea Partiers on the right.\n\nAlready a political action committee called We Will Replace You, staffed and directed by Sanders supporters and millennial progressives, is promising to launch primary bids against any Democrat caught collaborating with Trump. Other groups, like the Progressive Campaign Committee, MoveOn, and Democracy for America, are also raising money to fund progressive candidates.\n\nSquaring off against the left flank with be Organizing for America, which reportedly commands an army of some 32,000 volunteers, and has raised over $40 million since it morphed from acting as Obama’s campaign vehicle. In the fight for DNC Chair, Obama’s candidate Tom Perez won over Bernie Sanders’ pick Keith Ellison. Perez, who recently proclaimed that Republicans “don’t give a s**t about people”, and that “Trump didn’t win the election”, was considered the more moderate choice. And they say Republicans are in trouble."

    "text": "President Trump has had very bad luck so far with congressional numbers crunchers at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nAs he and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) were treading water while trying to rally their party behind the GOP’s health plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, the CBO and tax analysts tossed them an anchor. A report concluded that the plan would have the effect of driving up insurance premiums in the short term and leaving as many as 24 million Americans off the health insurance rolls in the coming decade—14 million by choice.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nNow comes a report from the scrupulously non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) with equally bad news about Trump’s plan to boost defense spending by $54 billion in fiscal 2018 while offsetting the cost with deep, dollar-for-dollar cuts in virtually every domestic program and federal agency.\n\nTrump spelled out his plan in his March 16 proposal for essentially raising the legal spending caps on defense and lowering the caps on non-defense discretionary spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. He also sought to amend the current year budget by adding $30 billion more to defense and again finding partial offsetting cuts in other parts of the budget.\n\nTrump campaigned on a pledge to pump billions more into the Pentagon to transform the four military services into an unparalleled global fighting machine. However, the CRS report dated April 3 and leaked to the Federation of American Scientists, concluded that Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense buildup would breach the 2011 Budget Control Act -- a budget law worked out by former President Obama and Republican congressional leaders that equally constrains defense and non-defense spending.\n\n“In addition, the administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations would exceed the current fiscal 2017 defense limit by $25 billion,” wrote analysts Pat Towell and Lynn Williams. They noted that in the arcane world of congressional budgeting, the caps on defense and nondefense spending for each year are “independently binding,” as Government Executive reported.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nDefense appropriations at those levels for either fiscal year under Trump’s plan “would trigger sequestration, in the absence of the appropriate statutory changes to BCA,” the analysts wrote.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service serves as shared staff to congressional committees and members of Congress. CRS experts and other staff assist lawmakers at every stage of the legislative process — from the early considerations that precede bill drafting, through committee hearings and floor debate, to the oversight of enacted laws and various agency activities.\n\nTrump and other White House aides belittled the CBO for getting its health care forecasts wrong in the past, and they can be expected to brush off the CRS findings as well.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\nThe CRS findings are a setback of sorts but hardly decisive. Trump is not the only one who is interested in raising the defense spending cap in the coming years to beef up the military. President Obama and many other Democrats were in favor of raising the defense cap even higher – but insisted that there had to be equal increases in domestic spending as well.\n\nSome Republican defense hawks including Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) complained that Trump’s proposed military buildup wasn’t nearly enough. In January, he issued a plan calling for a fiscal 2018 defense budget totaling $640 billion, or $91.3 billion above the cap.\n\nThere are many ways to get around the CRS findings, including altering congressional rules for appropriating funds or intervention by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is technically responsible for enforcing the spending caps."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/04/Donald-Trump-Still-Doesn-t-Understand-Unemployment-Rat",
    "text": "Back when he was still on the campaign trail, President Trump consistently displayed what seemed like a radical disregard for the facts about unemployment in the United States. He repeatedly insisted that the “real” unemployment rate was actually somewhere around 40 percent and that the Bureau of Labor Statistics — widely respected by economists and policymakers across the country — was perpetrating a fraud against the American people.\n\nAt the time, most political reporters assumed that Trump was just cynically manipulating the crowds at his rallies — that a self-professed “smart person” who graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania actually possessed at least a basic understanding of how unemployment figures are calculated.\n\nTurns out...not so much.\n\nRelated: Travel Industry Warns that Trump’s ‘Extreme Vetting’ Would Be Disastrous\n\nAt a “CEO Town Hall” hosted by the White House on Tuesday, Trump appeared on stage for a brief question-and-answer session. Sitting in front of a room full of business leaders — people he plainly considers his peers — the president displayed pretty remarkable ignorance of how one of the country’s most watched economic indicators is measured.\n\n“You know, one of the statistics that, to me, is just ridiculous...when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed,” he said.\n\nThat is spectacularly wrong. When someone looking for a job gives up, the BLS considers them to have left the workforce. It absolutely does not consider them as employed, though it no longer counts them in the ranks of the unemployed either.\n\nIf Trump had stopped there, it might have been glossed over as a slip of the tongue at a live event. But he didn’t. He decided to emphasize his disagreement with BLS, adding, “But I don't consider those people employed,” thus making it certain that he believes discouraged workers are counted as having jobs for purposes of the unemployment rate.\n\nRelated: New Obamacare Repeal Plan Would Leave the Hard Decisions to the States\n\nThe comments about discouraged workers came just seconds after Trump let loose another howler in front of the crowd of businesspeople. He was discussing the actual unemployment rate, which came in at 4.6 percent last month, when he replayed one of his hits from the campaign trail.\n\n“We have 100 million people if you look,” he said. “You know, the real number's not 4.6 percent. They told me I had 4.6 percent last month. I'm doing great. I said, ‘Yeah, but what about the hundred million people?’ A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people — a good percentage of them would like to have jobs and they don’t.”\n\nThe idea that 100 million people are out of work is also wildly incorrect, and something one would have expected White House economists to brief the president on once he took office. Here’s where Trump appears to be deriving his figure:\n\nThe BLS reports that there are about 253 million Americans in what’s known as the civilian noninstitutional population — that is, people 16 years of age or older who are not in the military or in jail, mental hospitals, retirement homes or other facilities. The agency also reports that there are about 150 million Americans currently employed. That leaves roughly 100 million people unaccounted for.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nTrump is treating those 100 million as though all of them are job seekers unable to find work. However, a vast number are high school, college and graduate school students. Others are stay-at-home parents and still others are retirees. A couple of lines down the table that BLS produces every month is the actual number of people the agency believes are looking for a job. It’s not 100 million, but 5.9 million.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that there was a single person invited to attend the event who didn’t realize how laughably uninformed the president — who talks constantly about jobs — was on the actual details of the employment situation in the U.S.\n\nThe only one in the room who didn’t know what Trump didn’t know was the man himself."

    "text": "Has the Dealmaker-in-Chief engineered an agreement with Lockheed Martin to secure a block purchase of controversial F-35 stealth fighters in exchange for Lockheed not protesting possible Navy plans to buy advanced versions of Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet?\n\nThe deal, which the military watchdog website Center for Defense Information says could involve more than 450 F-35s, would be worth about $42.7 billion based on the lowest current per-unit cost of the aircraft. The post on CDI, which is part of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), was the source for a CNBC story today, but Michael Rein, a spokesman for Lockheed, said in an email, “The assertions made in the POGO blog concerning Lockheed Martin and the potential block buy for F-35s are 100 percent false.”\n\nRelated: F-18 vs. F-35: Why Is Trump Talking Up the Super Hornet?\n\nA Defense Dept. official said that there had been discussions about a block buy for about two years but denied any knowledge of a quid pro quo involving Lockheed’s silence in the face of a push for more F/A-18s. He also said that the 452 aircraft in any block buy would not all be purchased by the U.S. A Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the company would have no comment.\n\nHowever, Dan Grazier, the author of the POGO post and a former Marine officer, said that his source is impeccable and he stands by the report. “I note that [Lockheed Martin] issued a blanket denial rather than attempt to refute the specifics.”\n\nAs Grazier notes in his report, President Trump has held meetings with Lockheed CEO Marilyn Hewson and Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and taken credit for jawboning down the spiraling cost of both the F-35 and a new Air Force One being built by Boeing.\n\nCiting an unnamed source, Grazier wrote: “The deal is essentially this: The Pentagon will purchase new model F/A-18 fighters from Boeing (approximate cost $92 million each) while the company agrees to work with the government to keep costs down on the Air Force One replacement.”\n\nGrazier is referring to what would be the F/A-18 Advanced Super Hornet. The cost for the most current version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet is about $77 million each.\n\nThe rest of the deal, he went on to say, is that “Lockheed Martin will not complain about the F/A-18 purchases because the president will work to secure the F-35 multi-year block buy.”\n\nRelated: Is the F-35 Really Streaking by Its Troubled Past?\n\nThe POGO post said that since the F-35 “has not yet even started the critical combat testing phase of its development,” production should be halted until the tests are completed. The DoD spokesman said the Pentagon is at the “tail end” of F-35 development and testing would be completed next year.\n\nOne F-35 flaw cited by CNBC was vertical oscillation on takeoff by the Navy’s carrier version of the aircraft, the F-35C, causing whiplash for some pilots. Lockheed said it has “just finished testing on a solution [to that issue in] the past month and it is being evaluated for approval by the Navy. If approved, we’d test it this fall during a sea deployment.”"

    "text": "In a move sure to rile US allies abroad and the travel industry at home, the Trump administration is considering a plan to set up a much more adversarial system for deciding which non-citizens should be allowed into the United States. Even if they are only coming into the country for a short stay, like a vacation, foreign nationals could be forced to disclose financial records and asked to hand over things like their social media account passwords and the contact records in their mobile phones. Travelers could also face interviews in which they are quizzed about their “ideology” and their attitude toward the United States\n\nThe program, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning, would keep President Trump’s campaign promise to impose “extreme vetting” on travelers entering the country as a means of keeping terrorists out of the US.\n\nRelated: How the New Trump Travel Ban Could Hurt the US Economy\n\nThe stepped-up scrutiny of travelers would, reportedly, extend even to those coming from countries that are currently part of the visa waiver program, which allows residents of certain countries to travel to the US for up to 90 days without first obtaining a visa.\n\nTrump administration officials characterized the intrusive examinations as necessary to keep the country safe in a dangerous world. Gene Hamilton, senior counselor to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told the Journal, “If there is any doubt about a person’s intentions coming to the United States, they should have to overcome—really and truly prove to our satisfaction—that they are coming for legitimate reasons.”\n\nBut industry professionals described the move as potentially catastrophic for the travel and tourism business, a sector already suffering because the high value of the US dollar is deterring visitors from traveling to the country.\n\n“It would obviously have a negative effect,” said Dr. Charles Goeldner, Professor Emeritus of Marketing and Tourism at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado at Boulder. “People would go elsewhere. You go where you’re welcome, and this casts an image of not being welcoming.”\n\nIt would be particularly hard on the tourism industry to apply the proposed requirements to countries that are currently part of the visa waiver program, said Goeldner, who also sits on the board of the Travel and Tourism Research Association. “One of the goals of the visa waiver program was to make it easy for these people to come into our country and boost our tourism industry, and it’s been a very successful program.”\n\nRelated: After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream\n\nOthers warned of the possibility of tit-for-tat retaliation against US travelers by the immigration enforcement services in other countries, making international travel less convenient for Americans. In the past, the US faced a diplomatic row with Brazil when that country temporarily imposed tougher entry requirements on Americans in response to similar action taken by the US against Brazilians.\n\nHowever, some cautioned, it is also possible that other countries, particularly those with economies that rely on tourism dollars to a greater extent than the United States does, might be initially reluctant to do anything to deter Americans from visiting."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/04/04/5-Alarming-Facts-About-America-s-13-Trillion-Student-Loan-Debt",
    "text": "The president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank sounded the alarm on Monday that the student debt crisis continues to mount.\n\nAt a staggering $1.3 trillion, outstanding student loan debt is casting a financial pall on millions of Americans, according to a new study by the bank.\n\nRelated: 15 States With the Most Student Debt\n\nA college degree generally gives people a leg up in buying a home and achieving other middle-class goals. However, holding debt is associated with a lower rate of homeownership, irrespective of degree type, according to the report.\n\n“Those with significant student debt are much less likely to own a home at any given age than those who completed their education with little or no student debt,” William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, told reporters on Monday. “Of course, home ownership is more than just consumption — it has historically been an important form of wealth accumulation.”\n\nWhile declining to recommend steps the Trump administration might take to follow up on Obama administration measures to ease this financial burden, Dudley said that anything that “makes college more affordable, especially policies that make it more affordable for lower and moderate-income households, would be beneficial for income mobility over time.”\n\nHere are five alarming details from the New York Fed report:\n\n1. Student debt continues to pile up and has nearly doubled over the past decade to $1.3 trillion. Borrowing by students and their families has picked up steam over the years as social and economic pressure grows to obtain a college education to get ahead, even as states reduce their financial support for colleges and colleges raise their tuition.\n\nRelated: How You Can Escape Student Loan Repayment\n\n2. Borrowers now leave school owing on average about $34,000. That is up 70 percent from a decade ago. About 5 percent of student loan borrowers owe more than $100,000, but they account for roughly a third of outstanding student debt.\n\n3. Loan delinquency climbed to 11.2 percent in the last quarter of 2016, the highest rate for all types of household debt. That means that student loan repayment is taking a back seat to other pressing financial demands, such as rent, mortgage payments, phone bills and credit card balances. This comes nearly eight years after the end of the Great Recession.\n\n4. More than one in ten borrowers are at least 90 days behind in repaying their student debt, which puts them in the “serious” debt category. Payment progress was particularly low among those with larger debts and those from lower-income areas.\n\n5. Although college-educated people are more likely to have the financial wherewithal to buy a home than those without a college education, the mounting rate of default on student loans is hurting young people’s credit ratings – and making it much harder for them to buy a home or condominium."

Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said the M27s that have already been deployed are “the most reliable, durable, and accurate weapons in our rifle squads,” according to Marine Corps Times.\n\nThe M27, a variation of the HK416 built by the German gunmaker Heckler & Koch, sells for about $3,000. The M4, which is used by most Army and Marines combat units, is manufactured by Colt Defense and FN America and costs less than $1,000.\n\nIf the Marines equipped 11,000 infantry riflemen – the number under discussion -- with the M27, the price tag would be about $33 million.\n\nThe M27 is said to be far superior to the M4, but Marine Corps Times quoted Neller as saying that while he is looking at a new weapon for infantry Marines, “we have to balance improved capabilities and increased lethality with cost.” But, he added, “our infantry Marines should be the most lethal force we can afford.”\n\nRelated: The Army’s New State-of-the-Art $580 Million Handgun\n\nThere is little question that the M27 is lethal.

    "text": "It can be hard to know which of President Trump’s tweets to take seriously sometimes, but evidently, his claim that the White House and Republicans in Congress are still working on health care reform after last month’s debacle with the American Health Care Act was true. According to The Washington Post, the White House is pressing an alternative version of the bill in an effort to win over both the hard right Freedom Caucus and the more moderate elements of the party, which combined to block a vote on the AHCA in March.\n\nHowever, it’s unclear whether the measure being discussed will have much more success than its predecessor.\n\nRelated: Under Pressure from Insurers, Trump Continues Obamacare Taxpayer Subsidies\n\nHouse Republicans found themselves in a bind two weeks ago when President Trump was demanding they vote to pass the extremely unpopular AHCA, a bill that had the support of about 17 percent of the country according to public opinion polls. It was unpopular largely because it would result in some 24 million Americans to be without health insurance within a decade -- 14 million by choice -- and would dramatically drive up costs for older Americans and the poor.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus was upset that the bill didn’t go far enough, demanding a rollback of multiple elements of the ACA that the bill didn’t touch, such as requirements that insurers not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and that they offer a suite of “essential” health benefits with every plan and more. Their object, above all, was to drive down the cost of insurance premiums.\n\nHouse moderates, at the same time, were balking at the changes already in the AHCA, concerned that many fewer Americans would be insured and that costs would skyrocket for the poor and older Americans who were not yet eligible for Medicare.\n\nThe version of the bill now being considered would not solve those problems so much as avoid them. The plan would be to push decisions about issues like essential benefits and coverage requirements down to the state level.\n\nRelated: Insurer’s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We’re Out\n\nFor example, the proposal would allow states to drop the “community rating” requirement of the ACA, which demands that insurers charge the same amount for coverage for people who are the same age. In effect, this is a backdoor way of eliminating the ACA’s ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. While insurers would still be nominally required to offer policies to people with existing illnesses, there would be no limit on what they could charge them. Just as it was in the days before the ACA, sick people would be effectively priced out of the market for health insurance.\n\nSimilarly, the proposal would allow states to eliminate the ACA’s requirement that insurance policies purchased with government subsidies cover a set of standard benefits, including hospital stays, outpatient procedures, addiction and mental health treatment, maternity care, and more. The new plan would allow states to create a system in which people could use federal dollars to buy insurance plans that offer far less protection from health-related costs than the ACA requires.\n\nThis last move would create at least the possibility that states could achieve one of the key goals articulated by members of the Freedom Caucus: driving down average health insurance premiums. But it would do so in the same way that removing the requirement that new cars have brakes and airbags would make automobiles more affordable.\n\nThe hope among supporters of the plan is that by allowing the sale of bare-bones policies, the change would reduce the number of people who lose coverage under the new rules. However, it’s not clear that the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation would be willing to play ball when they score the bill. Last year, the CBO made it plain that for purposes of analyzing the effects of healthcare legislation, it would not consider people “covered” by insurance unless they were substantially protected from major financial risks.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nThe upside of this plan, from the perspective of the White House and Congressional Republicans, is that it would allow them to claim that they have kept their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act while avoiding the hard work of crafting a measure that solves the thorny problems that repealing the bill creates.\n\nAs with the original version of the AHCA, Republicans in the House can’t count on getting any Democratic votes for this iteration of the ACA replacement plan. So, assuming the changes are sufficient to win over the Freedom Caucus, the big question is the reaction of the more moderate members of the Republican conference.\n\nWill the fig leaf of devolving key decisions to the states be enough political cover, or will the latest attempt to repeal the ACA cause another fracture in the party, albeit along a different fault line?"

    "text": "President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have squandered their first few months of unified control, bungling a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and finding it difficult to even keep the government funded by the end of April. But they’ve had a lonely area of success: methodically taking down Obama-era regulations.\n\nAn obscure law (only used once before in history) called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) empowers Congress to pass resolutions of disapproval for any regulation passed in the last 60 legislative days of the last session. The resolutions require only a majority vote, avoiding the Senate filibuster. And Republicans have leaned heavily on the CRA in 2017, passing 13 resolutions through the House and Senate.\n\nTrump has signed nine of them into law thus far, out of only 18 public laws signed. The latest, signed just yesterday, kills a rule that would have blocked Internet providers from selling their customers' personal information. Another four await his signature, and 20 more could pass Congress before a mid-May deadline.\n\nRelated: The One Way Trump’s Administration Really Is a Fine-Tuned Machine\n\nSenator Pat Toomey (R-PA) wants to extend CRA’s reach into routine agency guidance on how they will interpret existing rules. Toomey wants to eliminate banking regulators’ warnings to banks to reduce issuance of risky “leveraged loans,” and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s bulletin to indirect auto lenders about complying with anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOnce Trump signs a resolution, the regulation is nullified, and federal agencies cannot create a “substantially similar” rule without Congressional approval. So the Fair Play and Safe Workplaces rule, which would have forced federal contractors to disclose violations of labor law, or the stream protection rule barring waste disposal from surface coal mining into waterways, will be sidelined potentially forever.\n\nBecause I like drinking water untainted by coal waste, and oppose my tax dollars going to companies that continually harm their workers, I’m saddened by the rampant use of CRA. But I’m also wondering why so many rules weren’t finalized by the Obama administration earlier in his presidency, when they wouldn’t be vulnerable to Congressional nullification. The CRA makes “midnight rules” enacted as far back as June 2016 eligible for disapproval. But that’s seven and a half years into Obama’s tenure. Why did so many important rules wait so long?\n\nRelated: Here’s Who Wins With Trump’s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nThere’s no one answer to this question. But part can be found in the byzantine rulemaking process, which creates unnecessary bottlenecks and mountains of delays. In fact, contrary to Republican claims about dark-of-night scheming to usher in regulations before leaving the White House, some of these “midnight” rules were proposed as long as three years ago.\n\nUnder the current process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and over a dozen other statutes, agencies must publish proposed rules openly, give the public ample time to comment, and take those comments into account in the final regulation. Agencies must study the impact of their rule on the environment and small businesses. They have to analyze costs to state, local and tribal governments. They have to review whether the rule would collect undue information on Americans. Combine that with having to work through comments, which historically come overwhelmingly from the industry subject to the rule, and the gauntlet can take years to complete.\n\nThere’s another hurdle at every step, a subsidiary of the Office of Management and Budget called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Established in 1980, OIRA adds another layer of review of all proposed and final rules, performing cost-benefit analyses and ensuring that a rule fits with presidential priorities. Rules can bounce back and forth between an agency and OIRA for years, constraining agency manpower and running out the clock. Most of the groups meeting with OIRA on rules have industry affiliations.\n\nRelated: Why Your Web-Browsing History Could Soon Be for Sale\n\nTechnically, OIRA has 90 days from receiving a submission from a federal agency to issue a response. But “those deadlines are basically not honored,” says Lisa Heinzerling, a Georgetown law professor who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama. “So the rules can sit for a long time.”\n\nAgencies can grant a 30-day extension of the OIRA deadline, and Heinzerling explained that what usually happens is that OIRA calls the agency and tells them they’d better ask for another 30 days because that’s how much time they need. “The bottlenecks were huge,” Heinzerling said, regarding her time at EPA.\n\nWhile Heinzerling added these OIRA bottlenecks became less prominent in Obama’s second term, it still had an impact on late rulemaking, which is a defined trend. A study by the right-leaning think tank R Street looked at 1,400 rules between 1996 and 2014, finding that more than 50 percent of them missed statutory deadlines set by Congress for implementation.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Dangers of Government Tweets — and Not Just Trump’s\n\nAny delay gives industry more days of non-compliance. So all the burdens placed on agencies in finalizing rules are deliberate, to drown them in bureaucracy. It has a chilling effect too, making it seem insurmountable just to initiate a rulemaking effort. And the OIRA bottleneck shows that Congress isn’t the only entity meddling in the process. As part of OMB, the agency is directly under control of the president, and can be used to delay or kill rules that the president doesn’t favor.\n\nThe newfound love for the CRA adds a further complication. If endless delays in rules get too close to the CRA deadline, Congress can just wipe them out with a majority vote.\n\nHere’s one case study: a Department of Education rule on teacher preparation, designed to measure the effectiveness of classroom certification programs serving half a million would-be teachers, and help them improve. The final regulation got published last Oct. 31. But it began with a notice of proposed rulemaking back in December 2014. OIRA got a hold of it in September 2015, held onto it well beyond the 90-day deadline and got it withdrawn in February 2016, approving a new version in March. After another comment period, the final rule went to OIRA in July, and they took another three months to finalize it.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump\n\nUnfortunately, this was months after the CRA deadline, and last week Trump signed the resolution killing the regulation. Teacher prep programs will not be scrutinized as rigorously because OIRA dragged out the rulemaking.\n\nFixing most of the broken rulemaking process will require Congressional action. But presidents can change the OIRA component of it as they see fit. They can trust the experts they install at the regulatory agencies to properly balance economic effects of regulations with the public interest. In other words, as president, Obama could have done something to rein in the delays to his rules. He didn’t, and Trump is picking them off one by one as a result."

    "text": "The insurance industry, rattled by the chaos caused by the Republicans’ failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, has been demanding some reassurance from the Trump administration of a semblance of fiscal stability in the Obamacare marketplaces or else many more large companies will bail out.\n\nPresident Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) haven’t given are still trying to strike a compromise with the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House and other GOP factions to enact a major overhaul of Obamacare in the coming months.\n\nRelated: Insurer’s Message to Trump: Fix Obamacare or We’re Out\n\nBut on Monday, the Trump administration sent a reassuring message to the health insurance industry that it would continue to support billions of dollars of Affordable Care Act cost-sharing subsidies vital to insurers and moderate to middle-income beneficiaries while a lawsuit challenging their constitutionality works its way through the courts.\n\nCiting comments by unidentified administration officials, The Hill and Morning Consult reported on Monday afternoon that the White House and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would continue to make the payments while the lawsuit is being litigated.\n\nSince he took office two months ago, the Trump administration has been exploring ways to erode Obamacare through executive orders and administrative actions to ensure the government subsidized insurance program is caught in a “death spiral” of soaring premiums, high deductibles, and limited consumer choices.\n\nMany major insurers, including Aetna, UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and others had pulled out of many markets before the November 2016 election.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nAnthem and its Blue Cross-Blue Shield affiliates are seriously considering pulling back in 2018, as Jefferies analysts David Windley and David Styblo said is “likely” to happen in a note last week. If that happens, it will leave more than 800,000 individual plan customers in 14 states either without subsidized Obamacare coverage or more limited choices.\n\nIf Trump does pull the plug on the cost-sharing subsidies to cover patients’ co-payment and out of pocket costs, it would be a near fatal blow to the struggling program that has insured more than 20 million Americans since it was fully launched near four years ago.\n\nThe subsidies, totaling $7 billion this year and projected to rise to $10 billion next year, are considered essential by consumers and insurance companies to keep insurance costs relatively affordable.\n\nHouse Republicans claimed in a lawsuit that the subsidies were unconstitutional because Congress didn’t specifically appropriate the money, and a federal judge ruled in their favor in May 2016. The Obama administration appealed the ruling, but the new Trump administration has been silent until now whether it will continue to challenge the court ruling.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Americans Are Blaming Paul Ryan for the Health Care Debacle\n\nRyan optimistically told reporters last week that Trump could keep the subsidies alive while the case works its way through the courts. “While the lawsuit is being litigated, then the administration funds these benefits,” Ryan said, “That’s how they’ve been doing it, and I don’t see any change in that.”\n\nBut Ryan’s assurances alone weren’t good enough for many insurance executives, and executives told Axios that they wanted a pledge from Trump that the subsidies will continue before they commit to another season with Obamacare. During testimony last week on Capitol Hill, HHS Secretary Tom Price wouldn’t say whether the administration would continue making the payments, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nNow, apparently, the issue has been resolved, and Anthem and others may reconsider their tentative decisions to pull out from many markets."

    "text": "The Internal Revenue Service is the agency of the federal government that most people love to hate. As a result, it has been used as a political punching bag on and off for almost as long as it has been in existence. The most recent trend in politicians demonstrating their contempt for the national tax collector -- other than trying to get its commissioner impeached -- is to starve the agency of funding.\n\nHowever, despite major budget reductions -- or perhaps partly because of them -- the agency had been doing more with less over the past several years. One of the metrics the IRS uses to measure its performance is by comparing the amount of money the agency receives from Congress to the amount it collects in taxes due, expressing the result in the cost to collect $100.\n\nRelated: IRS Still Lacks Enough Auditors to Close the $458 Billion Tax Gap\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, that figure stood at $0.35 per $100, down from $0.53 as recently as 2010. It’s also the lowest cost per $100 collected that the agency has recorded since at least 1981, according to the IRS 2016 Data Book.\n\nWhile some of the recent efficiency gains can be attributed to the increase in electronic tax filing, the bulk of the transition to automatic filing had already occurred by 2011, before the most recent downturn in the cost-per-$100 measurement.\n\nIronically, at a time when Washington echoes with calls to further slash federal spending, one of the best investments lawmakers could make, at least with respect to return on investment, would be to funnel more money, not less, to the IRS. That’s because, properly directed, more IRS funding would drive those average costs even lower.\n\nThe Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent agency within the IRS, put it this way: “The main reason the IRS is underfunded is because the congressional budget rules were written with classic spending programs in mind — namely, a dollar spent is treated as increasing the budget deficit by one dollar. As the government’s revenue collector, the IRS is the only significant exception to that rule — a dollar spent generates substantially more than one dollar in additional revenue and thus reduces the deficit.”\n\nRelated: The IRS Just Invited More Tax Cheating by the Public\n\nOne of the effects of constant budget cuts has been a large reduction in agency headcount. The IRS had 50,400 full-time equivalent employees funded by annual appropriations in 2010. By last year, that had fallen to 38,800. One result of this has been the shriveling up of the agency’s enforcement arm.\n\nThe IRS left an estimated $458 billion in taxes uncollected last year because it doesn’t have the necessary auditors and enforcement personnel to collect it -- an investment that would cost only a tiny fraction of the expected return."

    "text": "Former President Obama wasn’t shy about ordering drone strikes – including a notable one that killed a fiery American cleric in Yemen who was accused of fomenting jihadist attacks – but his successor is ramping up the use of unmanned autonomous vehicles to attack America’s enemies.\n\nMicah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations recently calculated that Obama authorized 542 targeted drone strikes and special ops missions in 2,920 days -- an average of once every 5.4 days. In his first 74 days in office, President Trump has given the go-ahead at least 75 times, or about once a day.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Is Fast Becoming the World’s Policeman\n\nNow, as the Trump administration gives the military and the Central Intelligence Agency a freer hand to fight Islamic radicals on multiple fronts, and as air warfare increasingly comes to rely on remotely piloted aircraft, the frequency of drone strikes is likely headed higher.\n\nOverall, the pace of military operations appears to be increasing. Operations in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Somalia have all been ratcheted up in recent weeks. The New York Times reported last week that in the month of March there were more U.S. air strikes against targets in Yemen than there were in all of 2016.\n\nHowever, Gen. Joseph Votel, chief of U.S. Central Command, told Congress on Mar. 29 that there have been no changes in the rules of engagement since the end of the Obama administration.\n\nAt the same time, the Pentagon has become less forthcoming about troop levels. Recent deployments of 400 Marines to Syria and almost 300 82nd Airborne Division soldiers to Iraq were not announced, as had been the practice during the Obama administration.\n\nThe increase in the pace of operations may come as a surprise to Trump supporters who had hoped the new admisntration would withdraw from costly foreign wars. “People who believed that Trump would be less interventionist than Obama are wrong, at least so far and at least when it comes to drone strikes,” Micah Zenko wrote.\n\nRelated: Swarms of Cheap, Disposable Drones Could Be the Future of Warfare\n\nAccording to data compiled by Airwars -- a website that monitors allied coalition air strikes in Iraq, Syria and Libya but does not break out drone attacks – the number of monthly raids since the beginning of the year corresponds to peak periods during the Obama administration.\n\nWhat is different in the number of strikes in Syria: In November 2016, for example, Airwars recorded 351 allied strikes there; In February 2017, it counted 547."

    "text": "President Donald Trump has been trying very hard to convince his supporters that the ongoing FBI investigation into Russian interference in the US election and possible connections between members of his campaign and the Russian government are some sort of plot against him. Over the past several days, Trump has labeled the stories about the investigation “fake” and “a scam” on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the Federal Bureau of Investigation appears to disagree. Over the weekend, The Financial Times revealed that the agency charged with counter-espionage investigations is ramping up its inquiry into Russian election-meddling by bringing a veteran agent back to Washington to head up a new 20-person unit dedicated to the direction of the sprawling effort.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Protests Over Russia Investigation Hit a Crescendo\n\nOne of the sources the FT relied on said that the change reflected a “surge” of new resources into the investigation, and was seen as confirmation that the agency is taking the case extremely seriously. At the same time, Trump has been using his social media accounts to point fingers everywhere but toward himself and his associates.\n\n“When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?” he tweeted Saturday, referring to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer. “It is the same Fake News Media that said there is \"no path to victory for Trump\" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!”\n\nBy Sunday, he was touting a Fox News story from the previous day that he claimed proved that he and his associates had been “spied on” by the Obama administration. In fact, the story indicates, as was already known, that conversations involving people affiliated with Trump’s campaign were picked up as part of routine monitoring of foreign diplomats and other non-US persons.\n\nRelated: Flynn’s Immunity Request May Not Be the Bombshell Everyone Thinks It Is\n\nAfter Trump's claim last month that then-president Barack Obama had him wiretapped was debunked by intelligence officials, the argument turned to the question of whether the identity of Trump-related individuals was “unmasked” in reports disseminated within the intelligence community.\n\nThe Fox report on Saturday said that the “unmasking” was done at the request of a senior figure in the Intelligence Community. That, too sent trump to Twitter, to claim he had been “spied on” by the Obama administration. “If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.,” he wrote.\n\nOn Monday morning, Bloomberg’s Eli Lake wrote a story suggesting the unmasking of Trump associates in dozens of reports containing accounts of conversations between Trump associates and foreign actors came at the request of then-National Security Adviser Susan Rice.\n\nAccording to Lake, “One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration.”\n\nRelated: Is Nunes Toast? White House Struggles to Explain Who Leaked Intelligence\n\nThis would dovetail with Trump’s repeated claim that he was placed under surveillance for political reasons. However, it also raises a fairly obvious question: If this information was gathered for a political hit on Trump during the election year -- something that would be a stunning abuse of power -- why did nothing emerge given that it’s now clear that there were multiple contacts between the Trump team and Russian officials during the campaign?\n\nAn alternative explanation is that Rice, as President Obama’s National Security Adviser, had been informed that there was an active FBI investigation into the Russian meddling and the potential connection between the Kremlin and the Trump team and that she wanted to stay abreast of what intelligence agencies were finding."

    "text": "You wouldn't know it from the market's quiet performance over the last few weeks, but Wall Street just wrapped up its biggest quarter in four years, with the Nasdaq gaining 9.8 percent. In terms of consistency, the Dow's 4.6 percent gain marked the sixth consecutive quarterly rise, the best run since 2006.\n\nYet a combination of fears — over the fate of President Trump's agenda, the pace of Federal Reserve policy tightening and the disconcerting disconnect between \"hard\" and \"soft\" economic data — pushed large-cap stocks lower in March: The Dow lost 0.7 percent while the S&P 500 lost a fraction.\n\nWhere do we go from here? It all depends on whether the \"reflation\" trade that has driven the market higher since Election Day will continue.\n\nRelated: Is This a Sign of a Looming Stock Market Correction?\n\nThe stocks buoyed by that trade — particularly financials and industrials — suffered a violent reversal two weeks ago, leading the Dow to its worst one-day loss since October, as the GOP's health care reform effort died in the House of Representatives before even coming to a vote.\n\nCharlie McElligott, cross-asset strategist at RBC, notes that the reflation trade, if it's going to continue into this month, will need to be supported by ongoing strength in the dollar and crude oil. This, in turn, will depend on what the oil sheiks that run OPEC and the career economists/bureaucrats at the Federal Reserve do in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFor now, instead of putting pressure on risk assets, the Fed's newfound hawkishness is bolstering the reflation trade by lifting the dollar higher and attracting global capital into U.S. assets. Same with OPEC's jawboning about extending its production freeze agreement from late last year, keeping oil traders distracted from swollen inventories and ramping U.S. shale oil production.\n\nRelated: The 9 States With the Hottest Housing Markets to Start 2017\n\nWhat's helping all this is the fact that investors are in the midst of one of the great periods of easy gains and low volatility in market history. The only times stocks have been more expensive than they are now, in terms of cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings valuation, is the climax of the 1929 and 2000 market bubbles.\n\nAs for volatility, or lack thereof, Jason Goepfert at SenitmenTrader notes that the first quarter was the quietest for the Dow since 1965, with an average move (+/-) of just 0.32 percent. Since the last major volatility breakout in 2011, each successive macroeconomic scare has had a smaller and smaller drawdown and a quicker and quicker rebound. Traders have learned to \"buy the dip.\" The exceptions were fears over China and the meltdown in crude oil in late 2015 and early 2016. But support at Dow 15,500 held fast.\n\nEventually, the strong dollar and higher U.S. interest rates generated by the reflation trade will fuel fears of financial tightening — both in terms of consumer credit costs and corporate debt funding.\n\nBut not yet.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Deep Subprime’ Auto Loans Are Beginning to Worry Wall Street\n\nLooking ahead, the first-quarter earnings reporting season will kick off soon with the big banks: Bank of America (BAC) will report on April 18.

    "text": "After years of largely brutal budget cuts and workforce reductions that hampered their enforcement efforts, the Internal Revenue Service recently emerged relatively unscathed from the first round of President Trump’s budget cuts for 2018.\n\nWhile early forecasts suggested the IRS would be hit with a 14 percent reduction from 2017 levels, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin apparently successfully intervened to blunt the cut. Trump sent a preliminary budget request to Congress last month proposing deep cuts in most agencies but seeking a reduction of just two percent or $239 million from the IRS’s $11.2 billion fiscal 2017 spending level.\n\nRelated: The IRS Just Invited More Tax Cheating by the Public\n\nThe budget request states that the new, reduced spending level would be enough to “preserve key operations of the IRS,” including combating identification theft and tax fraud and improving tax collections to help reduce the deficit. The proposed budget would also shift resources to hasten the timetable for handling virtually all tax returns and correspondence electronically rather than on paper.\n\nBut while IRS Commissioner John Koskinen dodged another budgetary bullet, his agency is still understaffed and could take years to rebuild its tax enforcement and auditing operations to previous levels. The IRS, once a feared and highly respected agency, saw its influence diminished after congressional Republicans began slashing its budget in protest of the agency’s harsh responses to requests from conservative activist groups for tax-exempt status during the 2012 election.\n\nIn a letter last week to a House appropriations subcommittee, 48 Democrats including Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota urged that Congress boost IRS spending by $1.7 billion in the coming year rather than impose further cutbacks. “An increase in funding for the IRS will reverse the short-sighted and damaging budget cuts which have increased our national debt, left the IRS ill-equipped to combat refund errors and fraud, drastically reduced taxpayer services, dangerously reduced audits, and limits the IRS’s ability to implement new laws passed by Congress,” the letter states.\n\nNearly 80 percent of all tax returns are filed electronically, which accounts for the reduction of some IRS staffers. Similarly, the IRS website and automated phone service have taken some of the burdens away from customer service agents, who have also been reduced. The agency is also considering 16 “electronic recommendations” that would continue to transform the agency into a digital enterprise.\n\nOver the past five years, as the agency’s budget continued to shrink, the IRS lost almost 15 percent of its workforce, according to the new 2016 IRS Data Book. “Key measures of enforcement activity, including audit rates, have also declined in several categories,” the IRS said in a summary accompanying the new data compilation.\n\nBy 2016, the IRS workforce totaled 77,924 full-time equivalent employees, down slightly from 79,890 in 2015. That workforce included 10,174 revenue agents, 8,235 customer service representative, 8,267 tax examiners, 2,184 special agents and scores of seasonal employees.\n\nRelated: IRS Now Pegs Tax Cheating by Americans at $458 Billion Annually\n\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the agency’s current budget of $11.2 billion is 18 percent below the 2010 level, after adjusting for inflation. Because the agency is labor intensive and most IRS funding goes for staffing, the budget cuts have rippled through the workforce.\n\nArguably, the biggest loss has been in the enforcement division – which over the years has taken the lead in cracking down on tax scofflaws and recovering billions in unpaid taxes. The agency’s enforcement staff has steadily declined, from more than 50,000 in 2010 to just 38,000 in 2016, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\nIndeed, the agency conducted just 1.2 million examinations of tax returns in 2013, a 16 percent decline from audits the previous year. Although the IRS data document covers only the past two years, a more expansive analysis by The Washington Post published last month concluded that 1.2 million reviews were the lowest number since 2004. It also represented the sixth consecutive year of decline.\n\nLong under attack by GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill that included a failed effort to impeach him, Koskinen has been forced to make significant cutbacks in audits and compliance operations. That, in turn, has helped to spawn widespread tax cheating and major revenue losses, as The Fiscal Times previously reported.\n\nLast year alone, the IRS reported a stunning $458 billion average annual difference between taxes that were owed and paid, a 5.5 percent increase in what’s known as the “tax gap.”\n\nRelated: Here’s the Basic Problem With Trump’s Plan to Slash the IRS Budget\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Mnuchin stressed the need to beef up the IRS enforcement division, saying “That is an important part of fixing the tax gap.” Treasury officials estimate that every additional $1 invested in enforcement can generate $6 of additional tax revenue.\n\nSeven former IRS commissioners who served in both GOP and Democratic administrations have written, “Over the last fifty years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last five years and the impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.”\n\nThe IRS is charged with a broad array of responsibilities. During Fiscal Year 2016, the agency collected more than $3.3 trillion, processed more than 244 million tax returns and other forms, and issued more than $426 billion in tax refunds.\n\nIRS employees assisted more than 68 million taxpayers over the telephone through live assistance and automated services, taxpayers used the IRS website in far greater numbers. The post popular feature on IRS.gov, “Where’s My Refund,” was used almost 300 million times last year – up 27 percent from the year before.\n\nRelated: IRS May Have Allowed Insurers to Escape Millions in Fees and Penalties\n\nThe IRS is also responsible for helping implement the Affordable Care Act, both by providing refundable tax credit subsidies to moderate to middle-income Americans who qualify for health insurance coverage and by enforcing a mandate penalizing uninsured people who don’t apply for coverage.\n\nPresident Trump and congressional Republican leaders are planning to simplify the tax code, which could ease the workload. But the trillions of dollars in proposed tax cuts would be the first major overhaul of the federal tax system since 1986, requiring new training for staff.\n\nThe White House is still figuring out the best path forward on tax reform, though it does have one potential starting point: the tax plans that the Trump transition team developed between election night and the inauguration.\n\nPolitico obtained a copy of the transition document that essentially outlines many of the key tax proposals floated by Trump and his campaign advisers during the 2016 campaign. On the individual side of the tax code, for example, Trump would collapse the current seven brackets to three brackets of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent, while keeping the capital gains rates as they are and repealing the estate tax.\n\nOn the corporate side, Trump would lower the rate from 35 percent to 15 percent for all types of businesses and wipe out the corporate alternative minimum tax. The plan would also repatriate corporate profits from overseas at a one-time rate of 10 percent and scrap most corporate tax deductions, other than research and development credits."

And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don’t it won’t be good for anyone,” he said.\n\nPressed for details, he said, “Well, if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you,” Trump said. Asked to clarify that he was saying he could solve the problem without assistance from China, one of North Korea’s few global allies, he confirmed, “Totally...I don’t have to say anymore. Totally.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Protests Over Russia Investigation Hit a Crescendo\n\nThe president appeared equally assured of himself on the question of trade. He spent much of his presidential campaign attacking China for what he describes as unfair trade practices and vowing to slap punitive tariffs on goods coming to the US from China unless Beijing offered major concessions. He also promised to officially declare China a “currency manipulator” on his first day as president -- a promise he failed to keep.\n\nTrump is fixated on the fact that there is a trade deficit between the US and China -- something he sees as unfair on its face, even though trade economists insist that the mere existence of a trade deficit between any two given countries is not by itself important.\n\nAsked how he would bring down the deficit, Trump said it would be as simple as telling the Chinese president that it needs to happen.\n\nHe would do it, he said, “By telling China that we cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. This is an unfair deal.”\n\nRelated: China Finds a New Source of Cutting-Edge Military Technology: US Startups\n\nHowever, he balked at discussing tariffs, offering a brief soliloquy on how badly other presidents had misunderstood the mechanics of global trade and how he has the knowledge to solve the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet,” he said. “So I don’t want to talk about tariffs yet. But you used the word equalize. That is a very good word because they are not equalized. If you used a word other than tariff, it is not an equal. You know when you talk about, when you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations, they are world champions. And our country hasn’t had a clue, they haven’t had a clue. The past administration hasn’t had and many administrations — I don’t want to say only Obama; this has gone on for many years — they haven’t had a clue. But I do.”\n\nThe thing to watch when Xi arrives at Mar-a-Lago later this week will be which of Trump’s advisers seem most closely engaged with the Chinese president and his entourage. During the campaign, much of Trump’s tough talk on China seemed to emanate from a cadre of hardliners in his inner circle, including White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. All three are advocates of a much more confrontational policy on trade issues.\n\nThe other element of the Trump team is embodied by Kushner and, to some extent, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Until recently, Kushner’s family was in negotiations with a government-connected Chinese insurance company to make a massive investment in an office tower they own in Manhattan, and Kushner himself has been the object of a charm offensive by senior Chinese officials visiting Washington.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD? A $1.6 Billion US Weapon That’s Going to Korea – and Worrying China\n\nFor his part, Tillerson is the highest-ranking member of the administration to have met Xi so far, and he came out of a meeting with the Chinese president mouthing phrases, like “mutual respect,” that Beijing often uses to draw lines around areas they see as non-negotiable.\n\nThe faction within the Trump team that takes the lead in this week’s talks will tell observers a lot about the direction of the US-China relationship."

    "text": "It is widely believed that the air warfare of tomorrow will rely even more heavily on killer drones, but in a twist that could lessen the need for wildly expensive weapons systems, swarms of those lethal UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) could be disposable.\n\nRelated: Top Pay for Top Guns: Fighter Pilots Could Get $455,000 in Bonuses\n\nAt a conference last week hosted by the Air Force Association’s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a top Pentagon strategist suggested that autonomous, intelligent drones hunting targets in packs could make some multimillion-dollar weapons obsolete, Defense News reported. And they might not even return to base.\n\n“There’s a reason why we don’t take fine china and crystal to have picnics anymore,” William Roper, chief of the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office said, according to the website National Defense. “Once you’ve used paper plates and Dixie cups, you’re not coming back from that. It makes it a completely different experience. We haven’t had that equivalent in the military.”\n\n“All the things we build are expensive, and if they take off, it’s our expectation that they come home and land,” Roper said, adding that until now, survivability has constrained designed and planners. But relying on lower-cost robotic weapons that don’t require refueling, maintenance or protection could decrease the chances of human losses, deliver more operational flexibility and reduce budgets.\n\nThe notion of a swarm of drones launched and directed by a manned aircraft isn’t new, but what is fresh is the idea of sending wave after wave of throwaway UAVs into battle without risking the life of a human.\n\nRelated: More Killer Drones, Please: The Air Force Places a $371 Million Order\n\nRoper didn’t say what such expendable weapons might cost. The price tag on General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper drone, which can carry up to four Hellfire missiles, is about $17 million. Presumably, a disposable attack drone would cost far less.\n\nBut one analyst Defense News talked with was skeptical. “We can't even get a fighter jet to work for all the requirements of the different services,” he said."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/04/03/Universal-Basic-Income-Idea-Whose-Time-Should-Never-Come",
    "text": "Imagine if the government sent all of us a monthly check that covered our basic living expenses. We would be liberated from financial insecurity, and those of us working in jobs threatened by robotics and artificial intelligence (such as factory workers and Uber drivers) would no longer have to fear long-term unemployment.\n\nIt sounds great in theory, which is why the idea has drawn increasing interest both in the U.S. and in countries from Canada to Finland to India. A number of prominent techies and futurists have come out in favor of the concept, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently saying, “It’s going to be necessary.” Notable advocacy for a universal basic income has come from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley-based incubator, and the Niskanen Center, a DC-based think tank.\n\nRelated: 8 Reasons You Might Not Get the Social Security Benefits You Deserve\n\nThe idea isn’t just some socialist fantasy. The notion of replacing government services and in-kind benefits with cash has interested many libertarians and conservatives since economist Milton Friedman first advocated a negative income tax in 1962. The virtues of a system of cash payments include reduced bureaucracy, lower administrative costs and less paternalism. By giving people cash instead of food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers and other forms of in-kind assistance, government treats recipients as adults capable of making intelligent consumption decisions rather than as children whose lives need to be managed by a benevolent authority.\n\nUnfortunately, America’s city streets provide abundant evidence that many adults are unable or unwilling to manage their lives. Ultimately, universal basic income (UBI) would have devastating budgetary consequences, would not end poverty and could have adverse effects on our social compact.\n\nFrom a fiscal perspective, UBI proposals range from insufficient to catastrophic, depending on the level of the payment and eligibility. Finland is currently experimenting with a monthly payment of about $600 per adult. That is a far cry from the income a single adult would need to make ends meet in a major U.S. city. Even the federal poverty level of $990 for a one-person household is less than the median rent for a studio apartment in any of the nation’s 10 most expensive cities — and that’s before considering the cost of food, transportation, clothing and other essentials. In Oakland, California, Y Combinator is experimenting with a more realistic basic income grant of $2,000 per month per family.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push — Medicare for All\n\nUBI could be set at varying levels around the country based on living costs, or at a flat level nationally, which would encourage those in more expensive areas to relocate or supplement their income. Aside from location, income payments may need to vary by size of household. Right now, UBI proposals often specify a flat payment regardless of family size. But if a proposal were to reach Congress, I would anticipate calls for increased payments to larger families on both sides of the political spectrum. The current Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program pays variable amounts depending on family size.\n\nFinally, from a cost perspective, there is the question of how universal a UBI program should really be. Finland is limiting its experiment to the unemployed, but cutting off or scaling back benefits to those who find jobs creates disincentives. On the other hand, paying $2,000 a month to Bill Gates seems absurd, but Social Security checks already go to older billionaires such as Warren Buffett and President Trump.\n\nTo give some sense of the budgetary impact of introducing UBI, consider a scenario under which every head of household between the ages of 18 and 64 received a monthly $2,000 check. Based on a Census estimate of 94.8 million households, that would cost $2.275 trillion dollars annually. Offsetting this cost would be savings from eliminating federal nutrition programs ($100 million), federal rental assistance programs ($21 billion), TANF ($17 billion), Supplemental Security Income ($62 billion), Earned Income Tax Credits ($67 billion) and public assistance spending at the state and local level ($543 billion). Since these offsets total only $810 billion, we are left with a net budgetary cost of over $1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program. With a projected 2017 deficit of $559 billion and trillions in unfunded entitlements, the federal government is not well positioned to take on such a large commitment.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won’t Touch Entitlement Reform…Yet\n\nA final objection to UBI is philosophical. Western nations climbed out of millennia of poverty when they developed a capitalistic regime undergirded by the Protestant work ethic — an attitude that was embraced by people of all religions. The idea that all able-bodied adults have an obligation to work runs deep in our culture. Although there are many exceptions arising from luck (like inheritance) and rent-seeking (getting deals based on connections rather than competence), most of us still have an expectation that our economic circumstances should be connected to our willingness and ability to create value for others.\n\nUniversal basic income would delink productive behavior and economic well-being. It could thus break popular support for the market economy. Once the public conceives of income as a right rather than as a reward for value creation, voters will wonder why some still receive more than others. And if we stop thinking of strangers as potential employers, clients and customers, we may start treating them as rivals and enemies.\n\nAlthough I doubt that technological advances will produce mass unemployment, even if they do, paying people to remain idle or indulge in hobbies isn’t the correct policy response. Better alternatives would be to create labor-intensive public projects or to subsidize the wages of lower-skilled private sector employees to keep them competitive with automated alternatives. These options at least maintain some link between effort, value creation and reward."

    "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed on Sunday that – one way or another – the Senate will confirm President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme\n\nMcConnell has threatened to change the rules so that the Republicans can confirm Gorsuch as an associate justice with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote super majority typically required.\n\nRelated: Republicans Exhale With Trump’s Supreme Court Choice of Gorsuch\n\nIn a chamber where the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority, McConnell would need to round up at least eight Democrats to achieve a super majority – a task that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said today is virtually impossible. Just three Democrats have announced they will support Gorsuch while a few others are mulling over their options.\n\nIf McConnell blows up the rules by invoking the “nuclear option” to get Gorsuch’s nomination through the Senate with mostly Republican votes, it will risk provoking all-out warfare with the Democrats.\n\nAlthough the Republicans ignored the Democrats in their first ill-conceived effort to rewrite the Affordable Care Act, they will have little choice but to seek their support on virtually all the remainder of Trump’s agenda, including tax reform, infrastructure, and spending legislation crucial to avoiding another government shutdown late this month and raising the debt ceiling.\n\n“Judge Gorsuch deserves to be confirmed,” McConnell asserted during an appearance on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “Exactly how that happens, Chris, will be up to our Democratic colleagues. I think it is noteworthy that no Supreme Court justice has ever in the history of our country been stopped by a partisan filibuster -- ever.”\n\nPressed by Fox News host Chris Wallace about whether he would invoke the nuclear option and cut off the Democratic filibuster if necessary, McConnell replied, “What I’m telling you is that Judge Gorsuch is going to be confirmed. The way in which that occurs is in the hands of the Democratic minority. And I think we will find out exactly how this will end – but it will end.”\n\nRelated: Potentially Nasty Fight Looms Over Trump U.S. Supreme Court Pick\n\nLater during a joint appearance with McConnell on NBC’s Meet the Press, Schumer said it’s “unlikely” Republicans can muster a 60-vote supermajority to confirm Gorsuch and urged Trump and the Republicans to pull the nomination. “So instead of changing the rules, which is up to Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority, why doesn’t President Trump, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate sit down and try to come up with a mainstream nominee?” Schumer said.\n\n“Look, when a nominee doesn’t get 60 votes, you shouldn’t change the rules, you should change the nominee,” he added.\n\nMcConnell, the savvy, battle-tested Kentucky Republican, is under enormous pressure to deliver a big victory for Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) following their humiliating failure to unite conservative and moderate members of their party around an Obamacare replacement bill in the House.\n\nTrump has goaded McConnell to “go nuclear” since the president announced his choice of Gorsuch during a nationally televised White House ceremony the evening of Jan. 31. Trump picked Gorsuch from a list of 21 potential nominees to the Supreme Court that Trump’s campaign released last year. Trump boasted that Gorsuch is the “very best judge in the country.”\n\nRelated: Trump Would Favor Senate Rule Change If Supreme Court Choice Blocked\n\nGorsuch, 49, a federal appeals court judge on the 10th circuit in Denver, looked like a shoo-in to succeed the late associate justice Antonin Scalia, thanks largely to his Ivy League education, boyish good looks and sterling conservative credentials.\n\nThe widely respected jurist is pro-life and pro-religious liberty and is viewed by many as at least as conservative as Scalia. His appointment if confirmed will bring the nine-member High Court back to the same right-of-center balance that existed prior to the 79-year-old Scalia’s death. As McConnell frequently points out, Gorsuch received high ratings from the American Bar Association, 97 percent of the opinions he wrote were unanimous and he was reversed by the Supreme Court only once in his career.\n\nBut Schumer and many other Democrats in the Senate soured on Gorsuch throughout two grueling days of testimony and private meetings. Some said they found Gorsuch to be evasive on hot-button issues like abortion, gun-rights and labor-management issues. They questioned whether he would be independent enough on cases challenging Trump administration policies. Others complained that Gorsuch was a strict constitutional constructionist whose views were outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n\nSchumer complained that Trump never conferred with Democrats before choosing Gorsuch, in contrast with the past practices of both Republican and Democratic presidents who consulted with senior members of the opposing party. Instead, Trump relied on the recommendations of a few arch-conservative think tanks, including the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\nFurther exacerbating tensions is the lingering Democratic anger that McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders refused to consider former President Obama’s nominee for the same Supreme Court vacancy, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nObama nominated Garland a year ago to fill the vacancy caused by Scalia’s death. But McConnell refused to hold hearings on Garland, insisting that there was precedent the winner of the 2016 presidential election to fill the vacancy.\n\nUntil today, only two Democrats – Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota – announced they will support Gorsuch’s nomination. Both of those senators are from red states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump last year and face difficult re-election campaigns in 2018. However, a third Democrat, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, announced today that he, too, would vote for Gorsuch.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform--A Must Win for Trump and the Republican Party\n\nThe 60-vote requirement for cutting off a filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination was preserved as part of a highly controversial rules change orchestrated by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada in 2013 when the Democrats were still in control of the Upper Chamber.\n\nReid at the time was frustrated and angry with the Republicans for holding up confirmations of many of Obama’s nominees for federal appellate court judgeships and changed the rules to require a simple 51-vote majority for all federal judgeships except for those on the Supreme Court.\n\nAt that time, McConnell blasted Reid for changing a rule that he predicted would come back to haunt the Democrats. “Obviously, you can break the rules to change the rule to achieve that,” he seethed during a floor speech. “But some of us have been around here long enough to know the shoe is sometimes on the other foot.”\n\nMcConnell’s warning to the Democrats was prescient, and now he’s likely to turn the tables on them by killing off the 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nSen.John Cornyn (R-TX) left little doubt today that the Republicans would confirm Gorsuch even if the GOP had to resort to the most extreme tactics. “This is [the Democrats’] last gasp from trying to prevent him from being confirmed,” Cornyn told CBS’s Face the Nation. “But they won’t, and Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed this week one way or another.”"

    "text": "Donald Trump, whose Saturday mornings are apparently much freer than one might expect the president’s to be, spent a good chunk of time between breakfast and lunch yesterday rage-tweeting about news coverage of the investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election last year and possible connections between his campaign and that Kremlin-directed effort.\n\nThe President, like any other American, has the absolute right to challenge the accuracy of anything he sees in the press, and there isn’t a reporter deserving of the job who would argue otherwise. But the Trump White House is looking increasingly desperate to deflect attention from the inquiry to the point where claims of innocence start to have the opposite effect of the one intended.\n\nRelated: Flynn’s Immunity Request May Not Be the Bombshell Everyone Thinks It Is\n\nThe president protests too much.\n\nTrump began Saturday morning with an attack on NBC News and anchor Chuck Todd.\n\nWhen will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017\n\nHe continued, minutes later.\n\nIt is the same Fake News Media that said there is \"no path to victory for Trump\" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017\n\nIn recent days, Trump, through White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, has renewed his claim that former president Barack Obama had him under surveillance during last year’s election, despite sworn testimony from the heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency that this was not the case.\n\nThe effort has been aided by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes who last week made a surreptitious visit to the White House to view documents that he said appeared to validate some of Trump’s claims. It would later come out that the documents were provided by the White House staff, something that Nunes originally denied after making a show of hurrying down Pennsylvania Avenue to personally brief Trump on information Trump’s own staff had provided him.\n\nWhat Nunes appears to have been shown is evidence that intelligence intercepts targeting non-US persons outside the country incidentally picked up conversations by or about associates of the president. In some cases, he said, the identities of those individuals were “unmasked” in reports that were then circulated among intelligence agencies.\n\nRelated: Is Nunes Toast? White House Struggles to Explain Who Leaked Intelligence\n\nWhen US persons are incidentally picked up by intelligence intercepts, their identities are often concealed in reports detailing the findings unless they are relevant to an investigation or are otherwise necessary for analysts to understand what was being discussed. Nunes’ complaint is that he was able to discern the identities of some of the people mentioned in the reports he was shown.\n\nLast week, The New York Times disclosed that some of the reports appear to detail conversations that did not involve the president or his associates but were rather about them -- such as foreign ambassadors discussing plans for gaining influence or access to the Trump White House.\n\nOn Saturday, Fox News reported that the person who gave the order to “unmask” names in the reports is a senior member of the Intelligence Community, which sent Trump rushing to Twitter again.\n\n“Wow,” the president wrote, “@FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: ‘Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated.’ If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.”\n\nRelated: House Intel Chair Says Intel Agencies May Have ‘Spied’ on Trump\n\nIt was unclear why Trump placed some of the material in quotation marks because he did not appear to be quoting the Fox report verbatim. One of the reporters who wrote the Fox piece, in an interview broadcast on the network, suggested that the incidental collection of information about Trump associates had begun even before Trump won the Republican nomination, and was done for political purposes by the Obama administration.\n\nHe did not explain why information from a project ostensibly aimed at discrediting Trump, was withheld until Trump had been elected and sworn in as president.\n\nThe tweets came a day after Spicer, from the White House podium, again repeated Trump’s claim that the Obama administration had targeted him for surveillance despite the claims of intelligence officials that this is not true.\n\nIn support of the claim, Spicer cited comments by Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, that she had encouraged her former colleagues to preserve and disseminate intelligence about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to ‘Benefit the Putin Government’\n\nSpicer described Farkas’s comments as “devastating” evidence of an Obama administration effort to gather intelligence on Trump.\n\nIn fact, Farkas left the administration in 2015, when Trump’s run for president was still widely viewed as a self-indulgent publicity stunt. Multiple fact-checkers have pointed out that Spicer had taken her comments completely out of context.\n\nThe efforts by the administration over the past week, with the apparent assistance of Nunes, appear to be an exercise in muddying the waters on the question of whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the release of stolen emails that were used to embarrass Democrat Hillary Clinton in the final weeks of the presidential election.\n\nThe aim, to all appearances, is to create enough plausible doubt about the investigation to give the president’s supporters the ability to dismiss the possibility that there is real merit to the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nSo far, with public opinion strongly in favor of a continued investigation, it hasn’t been working. But it would be a mistake to discount President Trump’s ability to ultimately bend the political narrative to suit his needs."

    "text": "Only a week away from what will probably be the most challenging meeting with a foreign leader of his presidency so far, Donald Trump has chosen an unusual way of preparing the ground. Trump will host Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida estate next week, for meetings that are expected to focus intensely on trade between the leaders’ two countries -- and in particular, the US trade deficit with China.\n\nTrump, as he does, used Twitter on Thursday to send an early signal to his Chinese counterpart. “The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses,” Trump wrote. “American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Be So Worried About the Trade Deficit\n\nOn Friday, Trump was expected to sign a pair of executive orders directing his administration to undertake a pair of studies. One will look at sources of the trade deficit, with a focus on duties and fees. The other will look into whether foreign companies are “dumping” their products in the US, that is, selling them at abnormally low prices in order to gain market share or damage competitors’ profitability.\n\nThe White House has insisted that the executive orders are not focused on China, but it seems unlikely that Beijing will see things that way. Trump railed against China during his campaign, threatening punitive tariffs and promising to label the country a “currency manipulator” on Day One of his administration, the latter a promise he notably failed to keep.\n\nHe also hired economist Peter Navarro to direct the New White House National Trade Council. Navarro, whose views are well outside the mainstream when it comes to the importance of the balance of trade to the nation’s economic well-being, has made a career out of bashing China and predicting economic ruin for the US if its trade relationship with Beijing doesn’t get overhauled.\n\nThe meeting will also take place at a time when foreign governments and companies are starting to push back against Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on trade as well as on Republican leaders’ plan to consider a border-adjustable tax that would reward domestic production by placing a 20 percent tax on imported goods and raw materials while ceasing to charge US manufacturers taxes on revenues earned overseas. The tax plan, similar to the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed by many United States’ trading partners, would effectively subsidize American manufacturing and penalize foreign companies that sell goods into the US.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Gamble on a Border Tax and Anger Millions of Walmart Shoppers?\n\nJapanese billionaire Tadashi Yanai, whose Fast Retailing company owns the Japanese fashion outlet Uniqlo, said that he would abandon his existing US stores and his plans for a US expansion if the US began penalizing retailers who import goods for resale.\n\nYanai said that he recognizes that part of the desire for a border tax is to pressure companies to manufacture in America, but in an interview with a Japanese newspaper this week, he said he doesn’t like the idea of being pushed into locating his manufacturing facilities anywhere other than where he thinks it’s best for his business.\n\n“If I was directly told to do so, I will withdraw from the United States,” he told The Asahi Shimbun. “We would not be able to make really good products [in the U.S.] at costs that are beneficial to customers. It would become meaningless to do business in the U.S.”\n\nThe administration, perhaps hoping to make an example of someone in advance of the China talks, announced Thursday that it had determined that Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, And Taiwan are all guilty of dumping steel in the US market, and said that it would impose new tariffs on certain steel imports from those countries.\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Next Move Against China Could Spark a Trade War\n\nIn an appearance on CNBC Friday morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross pulled no punches in defending the order. You have to think about it this way: We are in a trade war,” he said. “We have been for decades.”\n\nThe news infuriated the countries named in the report, which included several of the United States’ closest European allies. On Friday, German officials urged the European Union to bring a case before the World Trade Organization, and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel released a statement that said, in part, “The U.S. Government is apparently prepared to provide American companies with unfair competitive advantages over European and other producers, even if such action violates international trade law...I very much fail to comprehend the decision.”\n\nThe message to China was clear: If Trump is willing to do this to his closest allies, consider how tough he’ll be on China.\n\nFor its part, China says that it doesn’t seek a trade surplus -- something its foreign affairs minister, Zheng Zeguang, reiterated this week. The reason there is a surplus/deficit relationship between the China and the US, Beijing argues, is that US consumers demand the inexpensive products that Chinese companies produce\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nBut in negotiating with the Trump administration, Beijing and the rest of the world need to remember that part of the intellectual underpinning of the Trump White House is the idea that traditional economic theories and accepted rules of thumb don’t deserve any particular deference.\n\nThat’s because in the view of White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, the economy is not something that exists apart from the government, and that should always be kept as free as possible from outside interference. In Bannon’s view, the economy serves the nation, not vice versa, and if sub-optimal trade policies serve another goal, then what he calls “economic nationalism” might have to win out over plain old “economics.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/31/Insurer-s-Message-Trump-Fix-Obamacare-or-We-re-Out",
    "text": "Anthem is the latest major insurer to voice its displeasure with the uncertainty and political gamesmanship roiling the Affordable Care Act markets, and is now sending signals that it may pull out of the system next year.\n\nIf Anthem and its Blue Cross-Blue Shield affiliates do in fact pull back in 2018, as Jefferies analysts David Windley and David Styblo said is “likely” to happen in a note on Thursday, it would leave more than 800,000 individual plan customers in 14 states either without subsidized Obamacare coverage or more limited choices.\n\nRelated: Five Ways Trump Can Cripple Obamacare\n\nAbout 255,000 people throughout Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri and Ohio would have no Obamacare insurers beginning in 2018 if Anthem were to pull out, according to a recent analysis by Axios. Meanwhile, 560,000 people in eight other states would have just one insurer to turn to.\n\nAnthem was noncommittal in reacting to the report of its imminent departure from the market. According to Reuters, the analysts said that, based on conversations with the company, “Anthem is leaning toward exiting a ‘high percentage’ of the 144 rating regions in which it currently participates.”\n\nThe company said in a statement, “We continue to actively pursue policy changes that will help with market stabilization and achieve the common goal of making quality health care more affordable and accessible for all.”\n\nReading between the lines, the company’s message seems to be that unless Washington gets its act together on health care, Anthem will join other insurance giants like UnitedHealth Group, Cigna, Humana and Aetna in pulling out of Obamacare markets in many regions of the country.\n\nIt’s an axiom of the health care industry that insurance companies need certainty and relative tranquility in the marketplace to effectively map out a strategy and set premium levels for the coming year if they are expected to stick with the program.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Americans Are Blaming Paul Ryan for the Health Care Debacle\n\nInstead, insurers and health care providers have been thrust into a crisis atmosphere in the wake of the collapse of the GOP Obamacare replacement legislation in the House last week. Since then, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) have been giving conflicting signals on what if anything will be done to try to recoup their losses and eventually push through changes.\n\nMeanwhile, since shortly after Trump took office, the new administration has been pursuing a series of administrative actions to try to undermine Obamacare, in an apparent effort to lend credence to the Republicans’ assertion that the health care law is in a “death spiral” of soaring premiums and shrinking coverage.\n\nOne way Trump administration could effectively torpedo Obamacare is by killing off a $7 billion a year out-of-pocket cost-sharing subsidy for insurers and moderate and middle-income people. The subsidies, considered essential by consumers and insurance companies in order to keep insurance costs affordable, are projected to rise to $10 billion next year.\n\nThe provision has suffered a serious setback in federal court. If Trump and Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price decide to drop an appeal by the Obama administration of the adverse ruling, then the subsidy likely would go down the drain – with dire consequences for the future of Obamacare.\n\nRelated: What Americans Really Want in Health Care Reform\n\nRyan optimistically told reporters on Thursday that Trump could keep the subsidies alive while the case works its way through the courts. “While the lawsuit is being litigated, then the administration funds these benefits,” Ryan said, “That’s how they’ve been doing it, and I don’t see any change in that.”\n\nBut Ryan’s assurances apparently weren’t good enough for many insurance executives, according to a quick survey of the industry by Axios. Many executives said they want a pledge from Trump that the subsidies will continue before the commit to another season with Obamacare.\n\n“Speaker Ryan’s comments are encouraging but not clear enough for companies to make solid business decisions,” said Ceci Connolly, the CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, a not-for-profit network. “If the House maintains its lawsuit and the Trump administration drops the appeal, millions of working families will lose those vital subsidies.”"

    "text": "When the news broke on Thursday that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is seeking immunity to testify before Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it was treated like Sammy “The Bull” Gravano turning on mafia boss John Gotti.\n\n“The First to Crack?” was the headline at Axios, where Mike Allen warned, “Flynn is a loose cannon with nothing left to lose. The Trump camp should be worried.\n\n“The Flynn Ultimatum” splashed across the Huffington Post front page.\n\nRelated: Is Nunes Toast? White House Struggles to Explain Who Leaked Intelligence\n\nOn Bloomberg television, anchor Tom Keene declared that “the weathervane changed last night for the president,” and reporter Kevin Cirilli agreed, calling Flynn’s move “a devastating blow” to the Trump administration.\n\nAcross the media, people were gleefully repeating Flynn’s own words from an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd last year when he suggested something sinister behind immunity requests from people with connections to Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “I mean, five people around her have been given immunity, to include her former chief of staff. When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime.”\n\nOthers reminded us that President Trump, as a candidate, told a rally last year that immunity requests were basically proof of wrongdoing. “The reason they get immunity is because they did something wrong. If they didn’t do anything wrong, they don’t think in terms of immunity,” he said. “If you are not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for, right?”\n\nRelated: House Intel Chair Says Intel Agencies May Have ‘Spied’ on Trump\n\nBut the idea that Trump’s inner circle is about to turn on him with devastating revelations about Russian interference in the election and collusion with the Trump team is probably just wishful thinking on the part of the president’s political opponents.\n\nA retired US Army Lieutenant General, Flynn has been under intense media scrutiny since he was fired as National Security Adviser less than a month after taking the job. He was let go after it was revealed that he had not disclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador that appear to have undercut the Obama administration’s efforts to punish Moscow for what US intelligence agencies insist was a Kremlin-backed effort to damage Clinton’s candidacy.\n\nUnder the circumstances, legal experts say, it makes perfect sense for Flynn to seek assurances that he won’t be put in legal jeopardy, even if he doesn’t believe he has actually done anything wrong.\n\nIndeed, that’s the exact argument his attorney, Robert K. Kelner, made in a statement Thursday. His client, Kelner said, “has a story to tell and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.”\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to ‘Benefit the Putin Government’\n\nHowever, he added, “Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him. He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.”\n\nTrump made the case somewhat less delicately on Twitter Friday morning, writing, “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!”\n\nOn the LawNewz blog, run by ABC chief legal affairs correspondent Dan Abrams, writer Rachel Stockman polled various well-known criminal defense attorneys, and the general verdict was that the immunity request was a simply evidence that Flynn’s attorney knows what he’s doing. The request was “fairly standard,” white collar criminal defense attorney Elkan Abramowitz told her. “I can’t imagine if I were his lawyer that I wouldn’t ask for immunity regardless of whether he did anything illegal or not,” said attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in government whistleblower cases.\n\nThe request was “fairly standard,” white collar criminal defense attorney Elkan Abramowitz told her. “I can’t imagine if I were his lawyer that I wouldn’t ask for immunity regardless of whether he did anything illegal or not,” said attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in government whistleblower cases.\n\nThis is not to say that Flynn hasn’t done anything wrong, or that he definitely won’t provide damning information about the Trump campaign and its relationship to Russia. But the simple fact that he has requested immunity isn’t proof of either."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/31/Mounting-Interest-Costs-Could-Shrink-Federal-Revenues-and-Harm-Economy",
    "text": "The mounting interest costs that the federal government pays on the public debt is rapidly eating away at government resources and could greatly restrict what future government leaders will be able to do in terms of spending and tax policy, according to a new Congressional Budget Office long-term budget outlook.\n\nWhile interest costs on government borrowing typically receive scant public attention, the CBO says that they will eventually exceed all discretionary spending on domestic programs and agencies, other than entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nThe bigger new out of the CBO report released Thursday, of course, is that publicly held debt is at its highest level since 1950 and is projected to rise to a startling 150 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2047 absent any dramatic shift in federal spending and tax policy.\n\nWith President Trump and congressional Republican leaders expected to press for major increases in defense and national security spending and deep tax cuts totaling trillions of dollars, government spending is all but certain to continue to outstrip revenues over the coming decades.\n\nEven under current policies, revenues will grow from 17.8 percent of GDP in 2017 to 19 percent in 2047, while projected spending will surge from 20.7 percent of GDP this year to 29.4 percent in 2047. That will perpetuate a yawning structural revenue gap that has forced the Treasury to accelerate its borrowing and will push the gross national debt to an historic $20 trillion level this year.\n\nAs a line item in the federal budget, interest payments on the debt sometimes gets short shrift or even ignored in congressional debates on budget and tax issues. Yet, in 2015 interest on the debt consumed six percent of the entire $3.7 trillion government budget and is on track to eventually exceed spending for most domestic programs and agencies, including law enforcement and social safety net programs like food stamps, transportation and housing.\n\nRelated: Clock Starts Ticking on Possible Treasury Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\n“Rising interest costs is responsible for half of all spending growth over the next three decades, and it’s not only driving up debt levels but crowding out investments in education, infrastructure, and national defense in the process,” said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a prominent budget watchdog.\n\nIndeed, if the current pattern of mounting debts and rising interest rates persist, interest on the debt will become the third largest category of the budget by 2028, behind only Social Security and Medicare coverage for the fast-growing population of seniors and retirees.\n\nThe combination of a strengthening economy, the Federal Reserve’s decision March 15 to raise interest rates for the second time in three months after keeping them at historic lows since the 2008 financial crisis, and rampant borrowing by the Treasury to keep up with runaway spending have all conspired to boost the government’s interest costs to well in excess of $230 billion annually.\n\nThe government is stuck on a fiscal treadmill, struggling to keep up with interest payments on the debt even as its budget and tax policies put it farther and farther behind. The Treasury regularly must borrow from China, Japan and other major creditors to overcome glaring cash shortage to keep the government operating and repay interest and principle on the debt.\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nUnless the Trump administration and Congress can agree by this fall to raise the debt ceiling and increase the Treasury’s borrowing authority, the government could be facing its first default in history and a partial government shutdown.\n\n“The higher the government’s interest costs, the more difficult it would be to achieve any particular target for lower budget deficits: Tax increases, spending reductions, or both would have to be greater,” according to the CBO. “Such policy changes could affect the economy and people’s well-being.”\n\nIf, for example, policy changes lead to an increase in marginal tax rates, the larger the increase the more people’s incentives to work would diminish, the report said. “Alternatively, if policy changes included a reduction in federal spending for investment, the greater that reduction, the more both output and income would be reduced,” the agency argued.\n\nCBO warns that mounting debt levels could have the effect of shrinking the economy by three percentage points between now and 2047. That would have the effect of stunting average income growth by as much as $4,000 a year – from a projected $90,000 a year to only $86,000 while discouraging government and private investment.\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog to Trump: Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in commenting on the CBO report, wrote that “If policymakers add to the debt, income growth will slow further.” For example, if Congress and the Trump administration were to enact $2 trillion of tax cuts and spending increases over the next decade, “average income will fall by an additional $2,000 per person by 2047,” according to CRFB.\n\nBesides cooling off the economy, CBO said, the mounting national debt may squeeze out other important priorities. That will make it more difficult for the government to respond to emergencies, such as natural disasters and wars, and it could ultimately increase the risk of another fiscal crisis or government shutdown.\n\nThe biggest drivers of government spending – Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest payments on the debt – taken together will nearly double in cost from 11.8 percent of the overall economy in 2017 to 21.8 percent by 2047.\n\nCBO also predicts that rising debt will have the perverse effect of further pushing up interest rates and adding to the government’s overall costs.\n\nUnder that scenario, the government would end up paying interest rates 0.5 points or 13 percent higher than they otherwise would be by 2047 if the government had done a better job of controlling the debt. At the same time, 10-year Treasury notes would be 0.9 points or 23 percent higher than they otherwise would be.\n\nThose rising interest rates would not only further boost interest costs for the federal government, but would “likely flow through to higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and business loans,” the CRFB says."

    "text": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive order earlier this month, declaring the state’s opioid addiction crisis a state of emergency, is yet another example of the state’s leadership in addressing a crisis. With overdose deaths from heroin and fentanyl up by 62 percent between the first nine months of 2015 and the same period in 2016, efforts to combat this tragic epidemic must include detox programs, counseling, and medical treatments.\n\nIn the realm of medical treatments, Maryland took bold action last year to reduce access to the opioid treatment drug, Suboxone, which has become a dangerous drug on the streets and in prisons.\n\nRelated: The White House Is Ignoring the Real Cause of the Opioid Epidemic\n\nSuboxone, which was introduced in 2002, has become a huge money-maker since the opioid epidemic swept the country at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2015 alone, more than 52,000 Americans died from heroin and synthetic opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The drug has generated $1-2 billion a year in revenues, first for its initial British manufacturer, Reckitt Benckiser, and the Richmond, Virginia-based company that it spun off two years ago, Indivior.\n\nMany doctors and patients see the drug as effective, but its manufacturer has fought hard to keep generic or alternative drugs off the market. This has led to an antitrust suit initiated last fall by attorneys general from 42 states, including Maryland.\n\nA sublingual version of Suboxone dispensed as a film that’s placed under the tongue has become a contraband drug smuggled into prisons, endangering inmates and correctional officers. In July, Maryland became the first state to fight back, taking the drug off its preferred Medicaid drug list—an action that Indivior appears to be vigorously fighting. Maryland replaced it with a newer treatment drug, that is said to be absorbed and processed by the body at lower doses and produce less harsh withdrawal symptoms than Suboxone. Already, prison smuggling is down sharply.\n\nRelated: Heroin Use, Addiction Up Sharply Among U.S. Whites\n\n“Smuggling has been extremely problematic,” Van T. Mitchell, former secretary of the state department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and Steve T. Moyer, his counterpart at the head of Maryland department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Van T. Mitchell, said. “Not only does it jeopardize prisoners' health and safety but it also jeopardizes the security of correctional staff.”\n\nAs other states consider following Maryland’s lead, Indivior has recently more than doubled its lobbying presence in the state capital bringing its Annapolis lobbying presence to five. The company has a highly paid nationwide network of lobbyists from Alaska and Wisconsin to West Virginia and Kentucky and nearly tripled its spending on federal lobbying last year.\n\nHowever, Suboxone, which cornered the market for opioid addiction drugs, has not only led to prison smuggling and antitrust issues but also can be addictive, causing considerable suffering.\n\nAfter years of trying to fight her son’s addiction to Oxycontin and heroin, several suicide attempts, psychiatric wards, detox programs, and many therapists, Laurie Kaye Schwartz of Kensington, Maryland took her son to a drug-treatment clinic where he was put on 16 mg. of Suboxone.\n\nRelated: Republicans’ Medicaid and Housing Cuts Deal a Double Blow to Drug Crisis\n\nHer son became dependent on the drug because it essentially replaces dopamine, one of the brain’s chemicals that influence happiness. Told that she was “better off keeping him on because there’s no protocol to get him off,” they went to another psychiatrist. Since physicians must be certified to prescribe Suboxone, the doctor got the certification and tried to taper down her son’s dose. When he tried to go cold turkey, he would get the shakes and vomit.\n\nMs. Schwartz’s 31-year old son was put on antidepressants, which seemed to help. He moved to California a few months ago but soon wound up on the streets and in homeless shelters.\n\nWith its market share falling and the company facing an antitrust suit, Indivior certainly has an interest in keeping other states from adopting Maryland’s policies and in weakening or reversing Maryland’s law. The company has only said that it “intends to defend” against the suit and “related actions.”\n\nIndivior’s push is no surprise given the price of Suboxone, which costs around $500 for what seems to be the “stabilizing” treatment course, the first tier of a multi-tier treatment program."

    "text": "President Trump put more than progress on climate change in jeopardy when he reversed the previous administration’s clean-energy policies on Tuesday. With a signature on an executive order, he put America’s global leadership more seriously at risk than at any time in the last seventy years.\n\nThe White House was careful not to mention the Paris Agreement, the landmark accord signed by 197 nations in 2015. But in repudiating the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, Trump is withdrawing from the world’s working document on climate control in all ways but on paper.\n\nRelated: Trump Picks up His ‘Pen’ to Eviscerate Obama’s Rules on Climate Protection\n\nThe Paris Agreement, using 2005 as the baseline, commits the U.S. to cutting greenhouse gasses by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025. The Rhodium Group, the New York research firm, says Trump’s executive order means America’s progress will stall at a 14 percent reduction the year after next, slightly worse than the cut achieved in 2016.\n\nThat’s called walking away, and the entire world is watching this time.\n\nObama did plenty to cause other nations to question America’s global leadership, but his role in Paris was a big exception. Significantly, the U.S. was instrumental in getting India and China, both top polluters, to get on board with ambitious targets.\n\nNow Trump is effectively telling them and 194 other nations that the U.S. won’t keep its side of the bargain it urged everyone else adopt. It’s hard to think of another time America said so plainly, “We’re not going to lead.”\n\nOn the climate question alone, it’s an open-and-shut case. China’s all too eager to take America’s place on the biggest issue facing the global community—as Trump will doubtless find when President Xi Jinping summits with him at Mar–a–Lago next week. (Was it a coincidence that Beijing confirmed Xi’s visit Thursday, two days after Trump’s executive order?)\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons the Pentagon Is Worried About Global Warming\n\nNot to be missed, China’s already powering into a market for solar, wind, and other alternative-energy sources forecast to be worth $8 trillion in coming decades. With $32 billion in global investments last year, China took leadership in renewable-energy technologies away from the U.S. just about the time Trump was inaugurated.\n\nThere was always a danger buried in Trump’s “America first” priority. Would his administration make the mistake of stepping back from international commitments, or would it more wisely devise new kinds of engagement, as Obama tried and failed to do?\n\nThe U.S. is out of the Trans–Pacific Partnership now, leaving 11 other signatories holding the bag. Why couldn’t Trump, once president, convene new talks to announce, “We’re in this, but we want to rethink the consequences for jobs in your countries and mine?”\n\nTrump has the Europeans thoroughly rattled. His military advisers pulled him back from his initial suggestion that NATO is useless, but he remains on the record approving Britain’s exit from the European Union, which formally began Wednesday.\n\nRelated: New EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Is Balking at Trump’s Big Budget Cuts\n\nThe EU and NATO are the two institutions through which the U.S. exercises its leadership across the Atlantic—and far beyond in the case of the military alliance. Subjecting them to re-examination is what leaders do; undermining confidence or unnerving members isn’t.\n\nA few weeks after Trump was inaugurated, the German foreign minister said he saw no place for the U.S. in four-way talks on a settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Sigmar Gabriel also explained that when he put this to Rex Tillerson, the just-confirmed secretary of state concurred.\n\nRussia, Iran, and Turkey, meantime, proceed with a peace process for Syria that, while tentative and slow, holds more promise than all previous efforts. The State Department confines its presence to an ambassador with observer status.\n\nTrump inherited the Ukraine and Syria problems from Obama. That doesn’t mean he has to assume the same lack of imagination and dynamism.\n\nRelated: China, EU Reaffirm Climate Pledges After Trump Backs Away\n\nIn Syria and Iraq, adversary Iran is fighting ISIS on the U.S. side while ally Saudi Arabia has been among the Islamic State’s material and ideological supporters. Across the Middle East, it’s obvious that long-term stability depends on a reconciliation between these two powers, Shi’a and Sunni respectively.\n\nQuick: Name the nation in the best position, and with sufficient influence in both capitals, to sponsor such a process.\n\nSeveral policy experts in Washington this week suggested that the administration might get away with dropping Obama’s clean-energy policies by tinkering with scientific assumptions, stretching the 2025 deadline, and submitting a new set of national targets. Even if that works—and it’s a question—Trump’s plans as announced put America first while effectively making it a follower on an issue it used to lead.\n\nIt adds up. One issue at a time, the Trump administration must do more to preserve American credibility and American leadership."

    "text": "An explosive New York Times story on Thursday afternoon reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes received classified information from two people who work in the Trump White House as part of what appears to be an effort to shore up the president’s insistence that he was “wiretapped” by the Obama administration.\n\nIf true, The Times report would prove that Nunes lied to the media about the source of the information that he discussed in a press conference last week, and that he may also have misled the public about the contents of the documents he claimed to have reviewed.\n\nRelated: House Intel Chair Says Intel Agencies May Have ‘Spied’ on Trump\n\nThe story will, at minimum, increase calls for Nunes to recuse himself from the Intelligence Committee’s stalled inquiry into Russian meddling in the presidential election last year and into possible contacts between members of the Trump administration and Russian intelligence officials. Others have said that recusal would not go far enough and that Nunes should be removed as chair of the committee.\n\nThe story began in a Capitol Hill hallway last week, where Nunes held a short-notice press conference and revealed that he had been given access to classified intelligence reports that, he said, “clearly show the president-elect and his team were at least monitored” by US intelligence officials. However, after initially saying that Trump’s own communications had been picked up, he later waffled about exactly what the reports said while leaving the distinct impression that actual conversations involving Trump transition team members had been caught up incidentally in the course of regular intelligence operations.\n\nHowever, according to The Times report, officials with knowledge of the documents report that much of what Nunes saw was actually reports about third parties in foreign countries -- ambassadors and other officials -- talking about Trump and how to gain access to or influence with his inner circle.\n\nAfter it had become clear that Nunes had personally briefed President Trump on the documents and called the press conference all before sharing information with the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee, he began to face calls to recuse himself from the investigation. Democrats, in particular, said that given his behavior it was impossible to avoid the perception that Nunes was working hand-in-glove with a White House that he was supposed to be investigating. Suspicions became stronger when Nunes revealed that he had been on the grounds of the White House complex when he viewed the materials.\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to ‘Benefit the Putin Government’\n\nWhen questions were raised about where he received the information, Nunes told Bloomberg’s Eli Lake that his source had not been a member of the White House staff.\n\nHowever, that appears to be false, The Times reported on Thursday. The newspaper identified Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director of intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, an attorney in the White House Counsel’s Office as the people who gave Nunes access to the information.\n\nIf Cohen-Watnick is, indeed, one of those responsible for giving Nunes the information, it would further complicate the situation. He was brought to the NSC by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn who was fired for failing to reveal his contacts with Russian officials. Earlier this month it was revealed that Flynn’s replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster had wanted to fire Cohen-Watnick but was overruled by Trump at the urging of close advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, the latter being also Trump’s son-in-law.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nIn a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer flatly declined to address the report, vaguely challenging its accuracy but refusing to address any of the specifics. The White House, he said repeatedly, had decided to speak only about the “substance” of the materials given to Nunes, not the “process” by which they had been made available.\n\nSpicer, however, didn’t really address much of the substance either. After announcing that the heads of the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate had been invited to the White House to review some of the materials relevant to the investigation, he declined to say what they were or whether they were meant to bolster Trump’s claim about wiretapping."

    "text": "The White House and congressional Republican leaders are clearly hesitating to move on matters like tax cuts after failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Some want another stab at Obamacare despite the risk of a second failure.\n\nSince last Friday’s debacle that revealed the deep fissure between the conservative Freedom Caucus and more moderate Republicans, Trump has repeatedly signaled that he might be willing to work with Democrats to get a measure passed. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) says that would be a terrible idea and that he hasn’t given up on the possibility of reviving the GOP plan if he can somehow unite his fractious party.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Could Flip-Flop on Obamacare and Save the Floundering Program\n\nBut as Tom Price, the new Health and Human Services secretary made clear in testimony Wednesday before a House panel, the Trump administration is determined as ever to dismantle key elements of the ACA and push through major changes more in line with the Republicans’ conservative, market-oriented policies.\n\n“So long as the law is on the books, we at the department are obligated to uphold the law,” Price, a former Republican House member, and orthopedic surgeon said during a House appropriations committee hearing.\n\nHowever, time and again, he dodged Democrats’ questions about the extent of his commitment to protecting key elements of Obamacare, including subsidies, mandates and other requirements for providing sweeping health care coverage to millions of Americans that are at the heart of the law.\n\nPrice said, “We believe that the current law has harmed many individuals,” citing soaring premiums and shrinking choices for consumers. And he repeated a phrase that he and other Republican leaders have used from the beginning of this year’s health care battle: that the GOP is more committed to “making sure the American people have access to affordable coverage” than promising that no one will lose his or her coverage.\n\nRelated: What Americans Really Want in Health Care Reform\n\nPrice, a leading critic of Obamacare, could undermine or even sabotage a program that has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans. Here are five of the most effective ways Price and other administration officials could bring Obamacare to its knees.\n\nKilling off a $7 billion a year out-of-pocket cost-sharing subsidy. Obamacare helps moderate, and middle-income people pay their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs through subsidies by taxing high-income earners. The subsidies, considered essential by consumers and insurance companies, are projected to rise to $10 billion next year.\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans claimed in a lawsuit that the subsidies were unconstitutional because Congress didn’t specifically appropriate the money, and a federal judge ruled in their favor in May 2016. The Obama administration appealed the ruling, but the new Trump administration has been silent until now whether it will continue to challenge the court ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\nObamacare helps moderate, and middle-income people pay their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs through subsidies by taxing high-income earners.

The Obama administration appealed the ruling, but the new Trump administration has been silent until now whether it will continue to challenge the court ruling. Ignoring the individual mandate. Another key component of Obamacare is a mandate requiring everyone without insurance through an employer or other sources to purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act or pay a gradually rising tax penalty. The mandate is essential to pressure younger, healthier Americans to sign up for Obamacare to create a more balanced risk pool of individuals so that insurance companies aren’t overwhelmed by older, sicker Americans who have the greatest health care needs.\n\n\n\nShortly after taking office in late January, Trump signed an executive order designed to undercut the Affordable Care Act by instructing HHS and other agencies responsible for administering the program to find ways to “minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens” associated with the ACA. The Internal Revenue Service responded in early February by weakening the health care law’s requirement that individuals either acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the government. If that stands, fewer young adults will feel obligated to sign up for coverage.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nGetting rid of the 10 “essential benefits” in Obamacare . The current law mandates all insurance policies include 10 “essential” services, including pregnancy and maternity benefits, mental health and substance addiction treatment, emergency room coverage, prescription drugs, ambulatory care and other services.\n\n\n\nTrump and congressional Republican leaders argued that getting rid of those requirements was essential to bring down the cost of premiums. Price suggested several times during his congressional testimony Wednesday that he may use his executive authority to redefine minimal health care cover by insurers.\n\n\n\n“This is one of those areas where we think individuals ought to have access to the kind of coverage that they want, not the kind of coverage that the government forces them to buy,” Price said.\n\n\n\n\n\n.

Curtailing promotion of Obamacare enrollment. In the final weeks of Obamacare enrollment for 2017, the administration halted several million dollars of paid television and digital advertising and other outreach activities designed to encourage consumers – particularly young people, to sign up for the program.\n\n\n\nHHS retracted the directive in the face of strong protests and complaints by Democrats and other Obamacare advocates. However, an HHS official warned in a statement that, going forward, “We aren’t going to continue spending millions of taxpayers’ dollars promoting a failed government program.”\n\nRelated: Controversial Medicare Payment Reforms May Hit a Wall at Trump’s HHS\n\n\n\n"

She expects similar hiring levels to persist for the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nRelated: The Navy’s $35 Million Scandal: Hookers, Booze and a Guy Named ‘Fat Leonard’\n\nAt the same hearing, Deputy Marine Commandant Lt.

    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan's approval ratings took a huge hit after the botched effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to a survey released Thursday.\n\nThe American Health Care Act was pulled from a House vote on Friday — and it appears most GOP voters are laying the blame at Ryan's feet instead of President Donald Trump's.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\nAccording to the poll from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, Ryan's approval rating sunk to 21% overall, while 61% disapproved of his performance as speaker. The data prompted PPP to call Ryan \"the most unpopular politician in the country.\"\n\nAt the start of Trump's presidency, less than three months ago, Ryan's approval-to-disapproval split stood at 33-43.\n\nEven with Trump voters, Ryan has seen his image crumble. That group supported Ryan with a 52% approval rating and 23% disapproval when Trump took office. It has since cratered to 35% approval and 41% disapproval.\n\nAdditionally, according to the PPP poll, 42% of voters said that Ryan was to blame for the AHCA not passing, while just 33% think it was Trump's fault.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nEven more potentially troubling for Ryan is that his own base, GOP voters, overwhelmingly laid the blame: 54% of GOP respondents suggested he was primarily to blame, compared with 13% who pointed the finger at Trump. Voters also blamed congressional Republicans more than congressional Democrats by a margin of 52% to 31%.\n\nAfter the AHCA was pulled, Ryan said at a press conference that \"Obamacare is the law of the land\" and that he was disappointed in the failure to get a vote on the GOP replacement.\n\n\"I will not sugarcoat this: This is a disappointing day for us,\" Ryan said. \"Doing big things is hard. All of us, all of us — myself included — we will need time to reflect on this moment and what we could have done to do it better.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, blamed Democrats and has since lambasted the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative GOP members who opposed the bill. Trump also supported Ryan after the AHCA misstep, but last weekend told followers to watch a Fox News show in which host Jeanine Pirro called for Ryan to step down. Ryan said Thursday that Trump apologized to him for tweeting about the show.\n\nThe poll was conducted with a nationwide representative sample of 667 voters on March 27 and 28.

    "text": "Republicans launched an internecine Twitter war on Thursday morning that, as trivial as it sounds, could signal real problems for President Trump’s policy agenda -- particularly the effort to avert a government shutdown that will begin in less than a month unless agreement on a new spending bill is reached.\n\nIt began early in the morning, when CBS broadcast an interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Asked about the Republicans’ failure to pass their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last week, Ryan expressed concern about driving Trump into compromise with the Democrats.\n\nRelated: How Trump and the GOP Are Handing Congress Back to the Democrats\n\n“What I worry about ... is that if we don't do this, then he’ll just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare, and that's hardly a conservative thing,” he said.\n\nHe later added, “I know he wants to get things done with the Republican Congress, but if this Republican Congress allows the perfect to be the enemy of the good, I worry we'll push the president into working with Democrats.”\n\nRyan’s apparent opposition to bipartisan cooperation drew a sharp rebuke from Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a fellow Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWe have come a long way in our country when the speaker of one party urges a president NOT to work with the other party to solve a problem. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) March 30, 2017\n\nRelated: Looks Like Trump Won’t Be Getting Any Money to Build His Wall This Year\n\nBut that wound up being a sideshow after the tweeter-in-chief stepped into the center ring. A little past 9 a.m., Trump lashed out at both Democrats and the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right element in the House of Representatives that helped defeat the American Health Care Act last week.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017\n\nTrump’s call to “fight” against part of his own party in 2018 -- an election year -- was extraordinary even for him, and one member of the Freedom Caucus quickly hit back. Michigan Congressman Justin Amash, a Freedom Caucus member tweaked Trump on Twitter, suggesting that the president has already been corrupted by the “D.C. Establishment.”\n\nIt didn't take long for the swamp to drain @realDonaldTrump. No shame, Mr. President. Almost everyone succumbs to the D.C. Establishment. https://t.co/9bDo8yzH7I — Justin Amash (@justinamash) March 30, 2017\n\nAgain, this all seems trivial on its face, but here’s why it could have some real consequences as the country approaches the expiration of the continuing resolution currently allowing the federal government to keep operating.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Another Swing at Controversial Budget Cuts\n\nTo pass a spending bill Trump and Ryan are going to need the cooperation of either the Freedom Caucus or a significant number of House Democrats -- the two factions that the speaker and the president appeared to be working hard to alienate on Thursday morning.\n\nDon’t forget, it was less than a week ago that Trump tried to blame Democrats for the failure of AHCA. Trump bemoaned the fact that when it came time to vote on the bill, which had been negotiated exclusively by the House Republicans and the administration, with no input sought or accepted from the other side of the aisle. “We had no Democratic support ... They weren’t going to give us a single vote,” Trump complained.\n\nTo have Paul Ryan just days later suggesting that it would be a terrible thing for the President to work with Democrats doesn’t exactly prepare the ground for a useful dialogue with the people whose help he may need in the near future to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThe reason he may need Democrats to pass a funding bill is that the other group President Trump antagonized on Thursday has more than enough votes to block one if they choose to do so.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform: A Must Win for Trump and the Republican Party\n\nLegislation to fund the government creates a sort of choke point in the legislative process, because when federal agencies have to shut their doors, not much else gets done in Washington. For that reason, spending bills tend to attract controversial riders that extreme elements in the Congress such as the House Freedom Caucus want to try to muscle through. In the recent past, Republicans have tried to use them to defund the Affordable Care Act or Planned Parenthood.\n\nHouse leaders will want to avoid attaching riders that Democrats in the Senate would consider poison pills, because they know they would be subject to the filibuster in the upper chamber.\n\nAfter handing Trump an embarrassing defeat on health care, Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina seemed last weekend to be ready to work with the president on funding the government, promising that he did not expect there to be any problems.\n\nEven then, there were serious doubts about whether Meadows would be able to bring along his caucus without some sort of major legislative prize attached to the bill. But now that Trump has vowed to work against them in the next Congressional election, it’s hard to see how sparing the president another embarrassment will be much of a concern to them.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nAnd if the Freedom Caucus breaks from Paul Ryan and the rest of the House GOP, the only way the Speaker gets to a majority on a spending bill that can pass the Senate is by attracting the votes of Democrats, the same people that on Thursday morning he said a Republican president shouldn’t work with.\n\nWith less than a month to go, there’s a lot of fence-mending that’s going to have to happen on Capitol Hill if there’s to be any chance of avoiding a shutdown."

    "text": "Even as Republicans continue to insist that the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act is still a legislative priority, some in the GOP recognize that President Trump’s strategy of sitting back and waiting for the healthcare system to “explode” isn’t really a viable option for the party in complete control of Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, two Tennessee Senators, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, introduced legislation meant to solve one of the problems bedeviling the ACA: Many insurers throughout the country have left the health care exchanges set up by the law, leaving many consumers with just one insurance provider and thus a limited--and often more expensive--choice.\n\nRelated: What Americans Really Want in Health Care Reform\n\nThe concern now is that next year it is possible that further withdrawals from the market could leave some areas with no offerings at all on the health care exchanges. To counter that problem, the bill Alexander and Corker put forward would make it legal for people who receive health insurance subsidies under the law to spend them outside the exchanges.\n\nUnder the ACA, the exchanges were set up to create a marketplace for individuals who were not covered by employer or government-sponsored insurance to purchase plans on the non-group market. Many of those people would be eligible for considerable government support to help pay for premiums.\n\nIn exchange for access to these consumers with federal money to spend, insurers that offered plans on the exchanges were required to offer coverage that met federal guidelines covering the type of care that was covered, restrictions on costs, and more. Insurers were still allowed to sell policies outside the exchanges, but consumers were not allowed to spend federal dollars on those policies.\n\nThat restriction, in a market where no insurers were on the exchanges, would leave individuals with no options.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\n“There are 34,000 Knoxville area residents who rely on an Affordable Care Act subsidy to purchase insurance, and after the one remaining insurer pulled out of the exchange for 2018, these subsidies are worth as much as bus tickets in a town with no buses running,” Alexander said. “There is also a real prospect that all 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange—approximately 195,000 with a subsidy—won’t have any plans to buy next year either, and millions of Americans in other states are facing the same dire circumstances.”\n\nThe bill would also waive the penalty that the law imposes on people who go without health insurance for those living in a market with no options.\n\nIn their statement announcing the bill, the two senators tried to preserve the “repeal and replace narrative”\n\n“At some point, on behalf of the American people, Congress and the administration have to resolve the issues that are driving up healthcare costs, limiting choices, and causing the exchange market to spiral downward,” Corker said. “However, in the interim, we must take steps to ensure people in places like Knoxville, where more than 34,000 individuals receiving subsidies under current law will have zero options in 2018, have the opportunity to purchase health insurance off the exchange in the individual market.”\n\nRelated: Controversial Medicare Payment Reforms May Hit a Wall at Trump’s HHS\n\nThey even set up a sunset provision for their proposal, saying that it would expire in 2019. However, there are any number of government proposals on the books that are ostensibly temporary but wind up being, for all practical purposes, permanent law.\n\nIt’s obviously too soon to say for certain that the effort to scrap the ACA and replace it with something more to Republicans’ liking is dead. But as House Speaker Paul Ryan said last week in the wake of the implosion of his party’s proposed American Health Care Act, it is inescapably the law of the land for the foreseeable future.\n\nAlexander and Corker may represent the first wave of Republicans acknowledging that with control of the government firmly in their hands, the political risks of allowing the health insurance system to die of neglect outweigh the benefits of appearing ideologically pure."

    "text": "Republicans say they still have hope of repealing and replacing Obamacare. But if or when they do go back to the drawing board to devise legislation that has a better chance of passing than the divisive, poorly conceived and ill-fated American Health Care Act, they’d be wise to keep in mind what Americans actually want from their health care system. So Paul Ryan might want to keep the infographic below, from the Journal of the American Medical Association, handy.\n\nBased on the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Health Tracking Poll, the infographic provides a sense of where Democrats and Republicans agree and where the partisan divide remains wide.\n\nRelated: Now It’s Democrats’ Turn to Make a Health Care Push: Medicare for All\n\nA few key takeaways from the Kaiser polling (you can find more of the results here):\n\nFavorable views of Obamacare are near an all-time high, and a strong majority of Americans favor many provisions of the law, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26, creating health insurance exchanges for small businesses and individuals, providing subsidies for lower income people to buy insurance, prohibiting insurance providers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and giving states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage. For each of those policies, support among Republicans is at least 63 percent, and it’s even higher among independents and Democrats. (Support for the individual mandate that requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine is much weaker, at 21 percent among Republicans, 30 percent for independents and 57 percent among Democrats.)\n\nThat all suggests that fixing Obamacare’s flaws might be a more popular approach to health care reform than repealing the law, and Kaiser’s polling earlier this month confirmed that 51 percent of Americans said lawmakers should not vote for repeal. Overall, just 37 percent of those polled (including 63 percent of Republicans) said repealing the Affordable Care Act is a top priority — a number that, coincidentally, is roughly in line with President Trump’s approval rating. At the same time, most Americans say that out-of-pocket costs for health care and drugs must come down.\n\nRelated: Controversial Medicare Payment Reforms May Hit a Wall at Trump’s HHS\n\nBut Ryan and his colleagues, especially the members of the House Freedom Caucus who fought for the creation of a more free-market system, should also note that the ideological debate over the government’s role in health care has largely been resolved, at least in the court of public opinion. Only 35 percent of those polled — and just 50 percent of Republicans — said that scaling back the federal government’s role in health care was a top priority. And 64 percent of the public favors providing a guaranteed level of health coverage for seniors and low-income people, even if it requires an increased role and higher spending by the federal government.\n\nThat may be too much for conservative lawmakers to swallow, and bridging the differences between what the public wants and what conservatives have promised their constituents may make it impossible to come up with a Republican Plan B that can pass both the House and Senate."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/30/8-Reasons-You-Might-Not-Get-Social-Security-Benefits-You-Deserve",
    "text": "A whopping 70 percent of Americans fail to maximize their Social Security benefits, in most cases because they fall prey to one of the eight basic missteps below. Don’t be one of them.\n\nFailing to Coordinate Spousal Benefits: Too often couples focus on only their own Social Security and fail to recognize that they may be eligible to receive up to 50 percent of their spouse’s benefit while waiting to claim their own benefits. Missing these benefits often costs a couple $40,000 to $50,000 in lost Social Security income. Also, filing the wrong type of application or filing at the wrong time can cost you dearly.\n\nNot Maximizing Survivor Benefits: Again, teamwork is important. Since the Social Security benefit of the higher-earning spouse is “inherited” by the surviving spouse, pursuing a strategy that increases the survivor benefit as much as possible can make a significant difference. Many couples miss another $70,000 to $80,000 by failing to maximize the survivor benefit. The higher-earning spouse should be especially careful about when to claim Social Security benefits.\n\nRelated: Here’s a First Draft of the GOP’s Plan to Overhaul Social Security\n\nWorking a Minimum of 35 Years: Social Security is based on your highest 35 years of earnings history. Continuing to work in retirement can be one of the best ways to increase your Social Security benefits, especially for married couples. Each additional year of current earnings from work that replaces a lower earning year will increase your (and potentially your spouse’s) Social Security. If you have less than 35 years of earnings, the non-working years will be counted as “0” and will lower your overall Social Security benefit vs. having worked at least 35 years.\n\nClaiming Early: If you’ve just turned 62 and want to claim your benefits, hold on. This is by far the single biggest mistake that most Americans make. Many believe that Social Security is almost an “automatic” benefit: turn 62, collect and don’t think about it again. Avoid this path if you want to maximize your benefits. If you already claimed your benefits early, all is not lost. You can suspend those benefits and minimize the damage by reinstating benefits when you turn 70. Also, if you’re within one year of your original filing date, there are ways to withdraw your application and start over.\n\nIf you do delay benefits, you receive what are called Delayed Retirement Credits (DRCs), which accumulate at a substantial rate — 8 percent per year between 66 and 70. Claiming at 70 vs. 62 means you’ll receive 176 percent of what you would have received at 62 for the rest of your life, and your spouse can benefit from your DRCs as well.\n\nRelated: A New Plan to Save Social Security for Another 75 Years\n\nEarning Too Much While Collecting Benefits: Another frequent stumbling block is the Earnings Test, which applies to those who claim Social Security benefits prior to their Full Retirement Age (66 for most people) and are still working and earning an income.\n\nEarning more than $16,920 in 2017 while collecting a Social Security benefit will cause the Social Security Administration to withhold $1 for every $2 in earnings over the Earnings Limit. While this money is not technically lost (the Social Security Administration credits it to your account at your Full Retirement Age), claiming early and having benefits withheld can present two major problems: 1) Benefits will be withheld so you will not receive all the benefits (if any) anticipated as the result of claiming, and 2) Claiming early (even if you’re not receiving a benefit because it’s being withheld) will still lock you into the early claim date which means a suboptimal Social Security strategy and less money.\n\nIgnoring the Impact of Taxes: Social Security benefits are taxable are considered income by the IRS and must be included on your annual tax return. Without proper planning, taxation can reduce Social Security benefits by up to 30 percent in some cases. This is called the Social Security Tax Torpedo and should be avoided whenever possible. Whether or not your Social Security income is subject to taxation depends on the level of your Provisional Income, defined as follows:\n\nProvisional Income =Adjusted Gross Income + Tax-Exempt Interest + 50 percent of Your Social Security Benefits\n\nHaving Errors in Your Social Security Earnings Record: You want to get credit for all your hard work, right? Well, make sure that you check your earnings record with the Social Security Administration on your Social Security statement. If there are errors in your earnings record, you won’t receive all of the benefits that you have earned. You have 3 years, 3 months and 15 days to correct any erros. After that, it’s too late.\n\nFalling into a ‘Rat Holes’: The Social Security increases that accumulate between the ages of 62 and 70 do not accumulate evenly, which creates what are called “Social Security Rat Holes” for those that are single. These are suboptimal times to claim your benefit based on the formula that is used to calculate what Social Security will pay you. For those born between 1943 and 1954, one rat hole occurs between 62 years and 63 years and 11 months. The other occurs between 65 and 4 months and 66 and eight months. In other words, the “Full Retirement Age” as listed on your Social Security statement is directly in one of these rat holes!\n\nMatthew Allen is the Co-Founder/CEO of Social Security Advisors and creator of the new course Maximizing Your Social Security produced in conjunction with Weiss Educational Services."

    "text": "Republicans on Capitol Hill have gotten off to a bad start as a governing party in full control of Washington DC. Despite having a solid majority in the House, the GOP failed to pass its first major legislation – the repeal of Obamacare that they had promised for the last seven years – even in that chamber, let alone in the Senate. The stumble exposed divisions that threaten to undermine other White House agenda items, so much so that President Donald Trump and his team have begun talking about finding ways to work with moderate Democrats to advance their domestic policy goals, such as tax reform. They’re even thinking about crossing the aisle on health care.\n\nThat strategy may not pan out either as the coming confirmation vote for Trump’s Supreme Court nominee could prove. While Republicans appear incapable of seizing the moment for governance due to internal divisions, Democrats seem ready to unify in a demonstration of opposition to governance.\n\nRelated: Top Senate Democrat Promises Fight to Block Trump High Court Pick\n\nNeil Gorsuch, a ten-year Tenth Circuit appellate jurist, finds himself cast into a strange role as the catalyst of this potential meltdown. Unanimously confirmed to his current position in 2006, Gorsuch spent the last ten years building a strong record of jurisprudence as well as a reputation for independence. Last week, Gorsuch demonstrated his grasp of the law and a gentle judicial temperament during a grilling by Senate Democrats.\n\nGorsuch’s deft handling of the interrogation and his ability to answer critics with the law and the broad context of his career had no better example than his exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, questioned whether Gorsuch could offer any proof that he “would give a worker a fair shot, maybe something in your background I don’t know about.” This question was part of a Democratic strategy to paint Gorsuch as nothing more than a corporate shill, but it backfired spectacularly on Feinstein. Gorsuch named ten cases off the top of his head, including two in which he found for plaintiffs in workplace discrimination cases, a sexual harassment case, and three in which he’d sided with environmentalists.\n\nFeinstein realized that she’d fallen into a classic blunder for cross-examination – asking a question without knowing the answer and allowing the witness to fill in the gaps. When Feinstein attempted to cut off Gorsuch, he insisted that his record showed him to be “a fair judge.” He concluded by declaring, “I can’t guarantee you more than that – but I can promise you absolutely nothing less.”\n\nRelated: More Democrats Oppose Trump's U.S. Supreme Court Pick\n\nSenate Democrats had come under severe pressure from progressive activist groups to find a reason to block Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, part of a strategy of “resistance” to the Trump administration. Rather than do damage to Gorsuch, the hearing made him look extraordinarily mainstream in both the law and in human terms. As the New York Daily News’ liberal editorial board expressed it, Gorsuch “withstood a murder board of questions last week to prove himself to be an extraordinarily qualified, whip-smart jurist with exemplary judicial temperament.”\n\nThe attempts to paint Gorsuch as extreme and unfit failed spectacularly, and instead, the hearings demonstrated that Gorsuch might be the most talented and prepared candidate to appeal to Republicans – who control both the Senate and the White House after an election in which this particular Supreme Court seat became a significant issue for voters.\n\nRather than acknowledge the obvious, however, Senate Democrats have decided to obstruct the Gorsuch appointment anyway, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for a filibuster against his confirmation. If successful, it would be the first filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee since Abe Fortas in 1968 for his elevation to chief justice, and that was a bipartisan filibuster over ethics issues that would later force his resignation from the court.\n\nRelated: Supreme Court Nominee to Face Confirmation Vote April 7\n\nOnly two other Supreme Court nominees have faced attempts at filibusters: Samuel Alito in 2006, and William Rehnquist in 1971 and again in 1986 when nominated as chief justice. The so-called 60-vote standard has never been applied to Supreme Court nominees, as Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler repeatedly wrote, and two of the current justices on the Supreme Court got confirmed with fewer votes.\n\nGorsuch’s opponents have no legitimate reason to block his confirmation other than political disagreement. Our system of government is supposed to function around such matters, however, especially when it comes to presidential appointments. If Democrats refuse to confirm Gorsuch, it will become clear that they will obstruct any nominee they do not choose for themselves. It will be an exercise of the absolutism of the minority – a refusal to cooperate in governance on anything other than the terms of a party that lost the last election and lost it badly.\n\nRepublicans may have proven themselves momentarily incompetent at governance over the American Health Care Act, but at least they tried to operate within the parameters of majority governance. Democrats might have taken a wiser course in cooperating with the traditional model of governance while reminding their supporters of the consequences of losing elections as a motivator for future cycles.\n\nAt least that would demonstrate a mature approach to the reality of their situation and acknowledgment of Gorsuch’s obvious qualifications for the Supreme Court. Instead, Democrats have muffed a clear opportunity to contrast themselves with the fumbling GOP and left Americans with a choice between a party struggling to govern and another absolutely refusing to do so."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/29/Why-Trump-s-Cuts-Social-Programs-Are-Even-Harsher-His-Budget-Suggests",
    "text": "The budget proposals coming out of the Trump White House over the past two weeks, whether official or floated as “options” to the administration’s negotiating partners, have been uniformly stingy when it comes to programs meant to benefit low-income workers and the very poor. A new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities goes beyond the topline numbers to illustrate just how historically harsh some of the proposals are.\n\nThe left-leaning think tank focused on what the Trump administration referred to as its “skinny budget,” an outline of its planned budget request for the fiscal year 2018, and found that it would sharply accelerate the already downward trend in funding, usually contained in block grants, for state-level programs serving those in need.\n\nRelated: Did Trump’s Budget Chief Say Cutting Meals Programs Is ‘Compassionate’?\n\nIn sum, the proposal would slash discretionary funding for four different block grant programs, and appears to presage other reductions as well. The total money available to the four programs would be halved in 2018.\n\nThe reductions will hit programs that have seen their funding reduced almost every year for a decade and a half, except for a single-year spike in 2009, as the government moved to help those impacted by the financial crisis.\n\nThe grant programs identified by CBPP include the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps poor people pay for heating in the winter, and the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides funds that are used to benefit a smorgasbord of programs, including after-school activities, meals on wheels and more. Those cost $3.4 and $3 billion annually.\n\nIt would also hit two smaller programs: the Home Investment Partnership Program, a $948 million fund that supports housing rehabilitation and affordable housing, and Community Services Block Grant, a $714 program that supports anti-poverty initiatives.\n\n“Eliminating these four block grants would cut overall funding for discretionary block grants by $8.0 billion — or 47 percent — from its $17.2 billion level in 2017,” the CBPP report finds. “That 47 percent doesn’t account for inflation or any cuts, rather than outright eliminations, to block-grant programs that may flow from the austere discretionary funding targets that the President has set for most federal departments and agencies.” [Italics in the original.]\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nOver the years, the push to block grant federal programs has resulted in more and more direct spending of federal dollars being delegated to the states. Lawmakers at the federal level cite the flexibility the grants provide states as a benefit, allowing those closest to the problems in the communities being served to determine how to allocate resources.\n\nIronically, that has also led to a decrease in the amount of those dollars flowing to the states.\n\n“Frequently, policymakers cite the very flexibility that block grants provide to state and local governments as their reason to cut or end them,” CBPP notes. “The increased flexibility and diminished accountability over using federal funds that are built into the basic structure of many block grants mean that states can use the funds in highly diffuse ways, making a block grant’s impact much harder to assess. That, in turn, can eventually prompt federal policymakers who are seeking budget cuts to target block grants and argue that block-grant programs lack sufficient evidence of effectiveness.”\n\nIt’s a strategy on display again with the Trump administration. In discussing the budget proposal last week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney was asked how the White House could justify cutting funding for programs like Meals on Wheels or after school food programs for hungry children.\n\nThe problems, he said, is that there is no evidence that they are effective."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/29/White-House-Ignoring-Real-Cause-Opioid-Epidemic",
    "text": "There's only one way to end the opioid epidemic, and so far — despite all the noise around Wednesday's meeting of a White House commission on the issue — it doesn't look as if the White House wants to touch it.\n\nYou see, what was discussed by the commission isn't just a plan in its early stages; it's a clear step in the wrong direction.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nIn a Wednesday press briefing following a meeting of this White House commission, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, blamed the crisis on \"cheap heroin\" flooding the market, and he credited President Donald Trump with already taking action against drug cartels. He framed the battle against the epidemic as one for the Drug Enforcement Administration and law enforcement.\n\nIf that's what the White House is focused on, it has the situation all wrong.\n\nThe problem here isn't with drug cartels; the problem is big pharma and its multidecade campaign to normalize the prescription and sale of highly addictive opiate pain medication. It's usually only after prescriptions for this medication run out, or become too expensive, when addicts turn to cheap heroin.\n\nIf Trump isn't going after big business, he's not going after this problem. Period.\n\nSerious\n\nSince the 1990s, big pharma has paid off doctors to encourage them to write prescriptions for opioid painkillers, it has generated studies that made the effects of these drugs seem way less destructive than they are, and it has greased the wheels of the US healthcare system to make insurance payments easier to collect.\n\nHere's an example of this behavior. Last month two Alabama doctors were found guilty of making millions by running an opioid \"pill mill.\" They were getting patients addicted, overcharging them and their healthcare providers for treatment, and accepting payments from Insys Therapeutics, a maker of fentanyl.\n\nAnother one: In 2009, the American Geriatrics Society created guidelines recommending that doctors use opioids to treat all kinds of pain. Of the 10 experts on the panel, however, at least five had ties to big opiate producers.\n\nRelated: How West Virginia Became Ground Zero for the Opioid Epidemic\n\nMore serious\n\nYou may recognize some of the names in this game, and you might not: Purdue, Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Insys, Mylan, and Depomed, to name a few.\n\nMore companies are involved in the rise of the opiate crisis, but those five are a start. At least, they're a starting point for Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who on Tuesdayannounced an investigation into the marketing practices of companies that manufacture opioids and the drugs that are meant to treat opioid overdoses. According to the press release announcing the investigation, McCaskill requested from those five companies:\n\nDocuments showing any internal estimates of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, diversion, or death arising from the use of any opioid product or any estimates of these risks produced by third-party contractors or vendors.\n\nAny reports generated within the last five years summarizing or concerning compliance audits of sales and marketing policies.\n\nMarketing and business plans, including plans for direct-to-consumer and physician marketing, developed during the last five years.\n\nQuotas for sales representatives dedicated to opioid products concerning the recruitment of physicians for speakers programs during the last five years.\n\nContributions to a variety of third-party advocacy organizations.\n\nAny reports issued to government agencies during the last five years in accordance with corporate integrity agreements or other settlement agreements.\n\n\"All of this didn't happen overnight — it happened one prescription and marketing program at a time,\" McCaskill said in the statement. \"The vast majority of the employees, executives, sales representatives, scientists, and doctors involved with this industry are good people and responsible actors, but some are not. This investigation is about finding out whether the same practices that led to this epidemic still continue today, and if decisions are being made that harm the public health.\"\n\nNot serious\n\nOf course, the ways a White House policy could deflect blame for the opioid crisis away from the pharma companies have been out in the ether for a while, and no one has articulated them better than Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nManchin, a Democrat, would have the government focus on the Food and Drug Administration's classification of opioids, maybe have the agency slow down approval for new opiates, and have a \"one-penny fee on every milligram of opiates that are produced and sold in America\" to be collected for treatment.\n\nAs a side note, Manchin's daughter Heather Bresch is the CEO of the drug company Mylan, one of the five companies McCaskill is going after.\n\nManchin also called marijuana the gateway drug to opioids.\n\nThis is a joke, and it's an insult to the people whose \"gateway\" to addiction was a doctor who said these medications would be safe.\n\nPlease stop joking.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/29/How-Trump-and-GOP-Are-Handing-Congress-Back-Democrats",
    "text": "If President Trump really intends to build his border wall, spend tens of billions more on the military, slash social safety net spending, and enact any number of his other campaign promises in his first term, he had better hurry up. Because there is a good reason to think that he’s going to run out of time a lot sooner than he expects.\n\nWhile it may seem alarmist to talk about a President running out of time when he’s only been in office for a little more than two months, a combination of factors, including Trump’s own unpopularity, the composition of the House Republican conference, and the changing face of the electorate might dramatically limit the new president’s influence with lawmakers in his first term.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform--A Must Win for Trump and the Republican Party\n\nIf history is any guide, the Republicans will lose seats in the House in the 2018 mid-term election. Some have even begun to speculate that with Trump’s approval ratings well under water already, the Democrats have a credible shot at taking control of the lower chamber, if not the Senate.\n\nIn 18 of the last 20 mid-term elections, the president’s party has lost House seats. And of those 18 elections, the average seat loss was 33. If that trend holds, the Democrats have a solid chance of picking up the 24 seats they would need to regain the majority.\n\nWhile analysts caution that much can happen between now and 2018 – and that it’s always risky betting against Trump and his ability to shake things up and turn things around in his favor – a turnover in control of the House in 2018 would have a devastating impact on Trump and the Republicans and limit their ability to get anything passed in the future without Democratic support.\n\nEven if the Democrats pick up no more than a dozen or so House seats, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) will face overwhelming odds against passing major legislation with his caucus split between the conservative Freedom Caucus and more moderate Republicans, and the Democrats positioned to make demands.\n\nIf that proves to be the case, Trump may have only limited time to achieve many of his major objectives, including tax reform, changes in the health care laws, deep cuts in many domestic programs and a major buildup of the military.\n\n\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\n“I would never rule out presidential successes in a Congress controlled by his party, even in the last year of Trump's term,” Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said Wednesday. “But this particular president is hobbled far more than most. His party is deeply divided into factions, and if Trump's unpopularity continues, GOP congressmen will be looking out for themselves as 2018 approaches. So, I'd say Trump's potential productive period is more like 18 months, and that estimate may be generous.”\n\nThe counterweight to that, of course, is that many House Republicans are in safe districts drawn by Republican-controlled state legislatures, and they will be tough to unseat. It’s more likely that in many of the races, the Republican primaries could be determinant, especially if there are a lot of challenges. Nathan L. Gonzales, a political analyst with Inside Elections, says the current “playing field” is far more favorable to the Republicans than the Democrats.\n\n“But there are still 18 or 19 months before the election, and I think there is an opportunity for the playing field to change,” he said. “It changed pretty dramatically from 2009 to 2010 [in the GOP’s favor]. I think that’s sort of the scenarios Democrats are hoping for. Because fundamentally, mid-term elections are referendums on the president’s party. If people don’t like the president or the job he is doing, they can’t vote against him in 2018 – they would have to vote against members of his party.”\n\nBut Trump is not getting much help from his party. In the first few months of 2017, the House Republicans have not exactly made a strong case for voters to keep them in control of the chamber. The effort mounted by House leadership to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act not only failed, but it also forced dozens of potentially vulnerable party members to support a bill that was so politically toxic that only 17 percent of Americans said they supported it.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Trump Won’t Be Getting Any Money to Build His Wall This Year\n\nTrump’s biggest problem, for now, is that his job approval rating is at 41.8 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average -- a bad omen for a newly installed president and one that could come back to haunt his party in the mid-terms. However, analysts warn against attaching too much significance to that in looking down the road.\n\n“What’s much more important is his job approval rating in the 10 or 12 states where there’s going to be a top 10 Senate race or in key congressional districts where the majority is hanging in the balance,” Gonzales said.\n\nTrump and the GOP may also have to deal with the demographic wave of millennial voters who now make up the largest single generational cohort in the US electorate, and are only gaining in numbers. Those younger voters did not turn out in strength last November, one of the factors that helped Trump win the election. However, those who did vote overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nA candidate who can mobilize younger voters -- or more actions by Trump that independently push them to the polls, like his executive order eviscerating Obama-era environmental regulations -- could make November 2018 an even tougher month for the GOP.\n\nWhile Trump’s approval rating will be important, more important is whether the GOP and Trump can show they can govern.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Another Swing at Controversial Budget Cuts\n\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster and political analyst, said, “The Republicans have been given control of the entire federal government, and now they have to deliver on at least some of the basic promises they made to the American people. If they manage to get a pro-growth tax reform bill through; if they manage to get some sort of replacement for Obamacare through that helps to make health care more affordable; if they reform the regulatory environment that increases economic growth and brings back some manufacturing jobs. Then they are in a very, very strong position to hold on to both the House and the Senate.”\n\nBut even if Paul Ryan remains Speaker of the House in 2019, the Democrats wouldn’t have to gain many seats at all to make his fractious GOP conference all but unmanageable.\n\nThe hard-right wing of the party, embodied in the House Freedom caucus, already wields power disproportionate to its size because it controls enough votes to deprive Ryan of a majority on legislation its members oppose. Those aren’t the guys (they’re all guys) who will be at risk of losing seats to a Democrat in 2018. It’s the less doctrinaire members of the conference whose heads will be on the block.\n\n\n\nThe National Journal reports, “Of the 36 at-risk House Re­pub­lic­ans, ac­cord­ing to The Cook Polit­ic­al Re­port’s rat­ings, 28 rep­res­ent urb­an or sub­urb­an dis­tricts where Trump isn’t par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar. And for every one of them Ryan loses, he needs to either placate the Freedom Caucus or cut a deal with Democrats.\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nThat means that many of Trump’s agenda items that are toxic to Democrats start to look less viable as pieces of legislation after 2018 -- and maybe a lot sooner if Trump’s unpopularity starts to make House Republicans worried about their election prospects.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump’s timeline. He still has time before members of the House start thinking about their reelection races, and there is certainly the potential that a few legislative victories could create the momentum he needs to push much of his agenda through Congress. But if the Trump Train doesn’t start rolling soon, it may never really get under way at all."

    "text": "During the election, both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump rejected the image of America striding the globe with billy club in hand and portrayed Hillary Clinton as too quick on the trigger. At times, they almost seemed to be reading from the same political playbook.\n\nYes, Trump far more forcefully vowed to destroy ISIS and was not afraid to say the words “radical Islam.” But the two populists with distinct grass-roots movements repeatedly said that by playing global cop, the U.S. had blundered into disastrous foreign adventures.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nBoth routinely savaged Clinton for her vote as a senator to authorize military action in Iraq. And Trump came close to bringing primary rival Jeb Bush to tears by harping on what he said was former President George W. Bush’s devastating decision to chase ephemeral weapons of mass destruction and topple the regime of Saddam Hussein, leading the country into a bloody Middle East quagmire.\n\n“We cannot be the policemen of the world,” Trump said at the first presidential debate. “We cannot protect countries all over the world.”\n\nBut that was then.\n\nNow Sanders is back to being a progressive voice crying in the wilderness, Clinton is wandering around the wilderness (or at least around the parks near her home in suburban New York) and Trump is commander-in-chief of a military that is flexing its muscles around the globe.\n\nIn Yemen, as The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, the Trump administration is ramping up support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in their fight “against al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias … drawing the U.S. deeper into the two-year civil war there.”\n\nRelated: US Strikes in Libya Kill More Than 80 Islamic State Fighters\n\nIn Iraq, 300 troops from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division are joining the battle to oust ISIS from its stronghold in Mosul, where some 2,000 fighters are embedded in the civilian population, according to Military Times. That pushes up the number of American soldiers in Iraq to more than 6,000, it said. On Mar. 17, as many as 200 civilians may have been killed by a U.S. airstrike, according to Foreign Policy.\n\nIn Syria, some 400 Marines began manning heavy artillery earlier this month in support of hundreds of U.S. Special Operations soldiers assisting Kurdish fighters and other ant-ISIS warriors trying to capture Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State.\n\nIn Libya, U.S. troops continue to monitor what is left of an Islamic State force decimated by B-2 bomber raids in January that attacked a desert encampment near the coastal city of Sirte, according to Stars and Stripes. Last week, Marine Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, chief of the U.S. Africa Command, said Special Operations teams would remain in the country for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn Somalia, drought and famine are complicating the fight against the terror group Al-Shabaab, Waldhauser told a press breakfast on Monday, but he also said last week that the military has asked the Trump administration for more “flexibility” on the rules of engagement with the al Qaeda-linked group, according to the website Military.com.\n\nIn Afghanistan, more troops may be needed for America’s longest military action, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said earlier this month, according to Foreign Policy. That would mark a reversal from a peak of about 100,000 troops six years ago to about 8,400 today.\n\nConsumed by the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election and allegations that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Moscow; embarrassed by a failed run at replacing Obamacare; and tripped up by all the predictable hurdles facing a young and inexperienced White House, the military-heavy administration seems to be giving the Pentagon considerably more leeway than it had in the Obama years.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here’s How Much It’ll Cost\n\nA lot of what looks like increased enemy engagement in all the hot spots mentioned above can be tied to Trump pledge to eradicate ISIS. But the thrust of the administration can also fairly be said to be more military involvement, not less.\n\nThe president has asked for almost $30 billion more in fiscal 2017 and $54 billion next year to rebuild the military and accelerate the fight against ISIS; he wants to expand the size of America’s fighting force, including 3,000 more Marines this year; and his plans call for a 350-ship Navy.\n\nEven in Europe, which was unsettled during the campaign by Trump suggestions that other NATO countries weren’t pulling their weight, the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, is showing the flag.\n\nIn January a contingent of about 300 Marines were deployed to Norway for six months – the first time since World War II – for training in an Arctic environment.\n\nAlso that month, 4,000 American soldiers landed in Poland to demonstrate what the U.S. ambassador to that country called “an iron-clad commitment” to NATO allies.\n\nIn the meantime, two months of war games continue in and around the Korean Peninsula, where tensions are high as North Korea angrily monitors almost 20,000 U.S. and 300,000 Republic of Korea troops engaging in joint exercises.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reports, North Korea carried out a new test of a rocket engine that could be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) – part of a pattern of provocative behavior this month.\n\nPresident Trump may not want to police the planet, but willingly or not, he is becoming the new U.S. cop on the beat.\n\nThe President has asked for almost $30 billion more in fiscal 2017 to rebuild the military and accelerate the fight against ISIS; he wants to expand the size of America’s fighting force, including 3,000 more Marines this year; and his future plans call for a 350-ship Navy."

    "text": "The knives are out for Paul Ryan. To survive, the House Speaker must produce a win on tax reform. That will not be easy because the obstructionist Freedom Caucus could once again join Democrats to defeat this next major White House initiative. While Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will bleat about handouts to billionaires, the intransigents on the right could well object to the “new” border adjustment tax.\n\nIt will become virtually impossible if the House sinks into another tussle over leadership. Ryan is pivotal to the success of the Trump agenda: He’s a veteran who understands the legislative process, a close ally of Vice President Pence and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a respected leader in the House.\n\nRelated: It’s High Time for Tax Reform, but the Republicans Are Doing It Wrong\n\nStill, the failure of the AHCA – at least in its first round at bat -- has put Ryan on the hot seat. The Freedom Caucus blames him for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, and for embracing the now mainstream position that the country expects all citizens to have access to healthcare. Like John Boehner before him, House Speaker Ryan has failed the litmus tests of the far right; they want him gone.\n\nPresident Trump may also wonder whether Ryan is the right man to push his agenda through Congress. His outsourcing of the healthcare overhaul to Ryan was a sign of confidence in the House Speaker and also proof that the president knows his own limitations. Unfortunately, he now also knows Ryan’s. To his credit, he has stood with the Speaker through the debacle, saving his ire for the Freedom Caucus, and rightly so.\n\nRyan’s American Healthcare Act of 2017 would have accomplished much that conservatives wanted. Through its dismantling of the fees and taxes which funded Obamacare, it effectively dismantled the law itself. In addition, the bill would have for the first time thrown a lasso around Medicaid, starting to rein in the third-largest federal program, which has tripled in size since 2000.\n\nTo be sure, the AHCA was flawed. It only made sense in the context of the two further measures which were to follow – a series of executive orders to be issued by President Trump and additional legislation. The three-step approach was required by the rules of reconciliation, through which it was meant to pass. Since those subsequent elements were never fully explained to the public, Ryan and others had a difficult task selling the AHCA to fellow legislators and to the public.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs the Border Tax to Secure Across-the-Board Tax Reform\n\nPaul Ryan can be criticized for taking that path, and for not bringing more people into the conversation. The weekend before the AHCA showdown, Ted Cruz told John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation that Ryan’s bill would not pass the Senate, and that it should include more provisions, like eliminating the Obamacare mandates and allowing competition across state lines to lower premiums. He argued that such items ultimately impact the budget and thus could be passed under reconciliation.\n\nCruz’ point is well taken. With a majority in the Senate and the right leadership, the GOP might have been bent the rules to suit the situation and gotten a more comprehensive and inclusive bill passed.\n\nRyan should perhaps also have brought the Freedom Caucus into the conversation earlier on. However, as one recently-resigned member of that group said in disgust, \"There are some members of the Freedom Caucus, they'd vote no against the Ten Commandments if it came up for a vote.\"\n\nThe fractious Caucus has single-handedly taken the wind out of Trump’s sails. After the bill tanked, the stock market sold off for eight straight days, ending a record-setting run fueled by optimism that the new president could boost economic growth. To what end? Though there is a small group in the country that fervently aligns with what radio host John Batchelor calls the “Boutique of No,” they are not in the majority, even within the GOP.\n\nRelated: Republican Meadows: Tax Plan Does Not Have to Be Revenue Neutral\n\nCaucus members may be wising up to the damage they have caused. Ringleader Meadows, facing the reality that thanks to his group Americans will continue to suffer the high costs and narrower choices of Obamacare, sounds more conciliatory. On ABC’s This Week, Meadows argued that the health care push wasn’t dead, but simply interrupted; he promised that President Trump “will deliver.”\n\nWe shall see. After Republicans met yesterday, there was speculation that the House might try again to bridge differences between moderates and the Freedom Caucus. If another attempt is in the cards, Meadows needs to show he can convince his group to compromise.\n\nThe ability to work together will also be essential to crafting tax reform. Conservatives want lower rates but will likely balk at the balancing mechanism of the border adjustment tax, which some have likened to a VAT. That tax is unpopular on the right because politicians can (and usually do) so easily hike the rate over time.\n\nIn the tax debate, Ryan must bring more of his colleagues on board earlier on. He will also have to do a better job of messaging, explaining that the border tax aims to spur exports and curb imports and help U.S. workers. It can be done; Trump will help.\n\nIf the Freedom Caucus and Speaker Ryan have learned some lessons from the AHCA fiasco, they can work together to get the job done. Both need to show they can govern for the good of the Trump presidency and of the country."

    "text": "The knives are already out for the Trump administration’s new plan to overhaul the federal bureaucracy using state-of-the art business techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nPresident Trump’s 36-year-old son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is heading a new White House Office of American Innovation invested with wide ranging authority to reform and reorganize the federal bureaucracy, improve health care for veterans and help fight the opioid addiction crisis by tapping into the best thinking of corporate America and Silicon Valley.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nKushner has begun holding twice weekly meetings at the White House with other senior officials, and has reached out to such corporate giants as Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk to brainstorm change in the federal government.\n\nKushner, a former New York real estate investor and media executive, told The Washington Post, “We should have excellence in government” and that “government should be run like a great American company.\n\nHowever, resistance is already building to Kushner’s SWAT team. Some public employees’ leaders and other entrenched interests are warning of possible Trump White House ulterior motives, such as vastly stepping up privatization of government activities to benefit the president’s friends in the private sector while targeting a federal workforce for downsizing that has remained relatively stable for years.\n\nSteven Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, representing 110,000 blue and white-collar federal workers, told The Washington Post that he is concerned that the new initiative will have a “lopsided focus” on dismembering offices that enforce environmental or labor regulations.\n\nRelated: Government Wastes More Money than You Think\n\nWhat’s more, Teresa Gerton, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Labor Department under President Obama, said Kushner and his team will find it tempting – if not irresistible -- to replace federal workers with computers to save money.\n\nBut having Kushner head the new office of innovation could be arguably one of the few truly positive and constructive ideas to come out of a White House that has been consumed with deporting millions of illegal immigrants, promoting a failed health care plan, and building a $25 billion wall along the nearly 2,000-mile-long southern border with Mexico.\n\nTrump vowed throughout the campaign to use his business skills and talents to reshape the federal bureaucracy while ridding the government of hundreds of billions of dollars of “waste, fraud and abuse.” But he offered few clues as to what he had in mind.\n\nMany of Trump’s predecessors tried but largely failed to make lasting and fundamental changes to the operations of government, and there are no guarantees the new president can do any better.\n\nRelated: Billions of Taxpayer Dollars Wasted Annually in Redundant Federal Programs\n\nYet the need for action is great and well documented. Trump is putting a high-profile adviser in charge of restructuring government.\n\nKushner, the husband of First Daughter Ivanka Trump and a successful real estate investor in his own right, already had an extraordinary portfolio of responsibilities in the White House, including driving foreign and domestic policy, making presidential personnel decisions and advising Trump on political strategy.\n\nNow he is taking charge of a thorough review of the operations of government, with an eye to changing many long-standing practices of a hidebound federal bureaucracy and accelerating the government’s move to the use of more sophisticated computer and internet operations. He will also set his sights on redundant programs that cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year.\n\nA 2014 report found that it took 10 different offices at the Department of Health and Human Services to operate programs addressing AIDS in minority communities, while autism research was spread over 11 different agencies. At the same time, Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado has eight different satellite control centers to control 10 satellite programs.\n\nKushner clearly is a newcomer to government, and will face a steep learning curve if he is serious about penetrating the far-flung operations of government and making significant change. Moreover, much of what he will be trying to do to upgrade the government’s computer operations will overlap with the operations of other government offices, including the U.S. Digital Service, led by former Google executive Matt Cutts and populated with engineers and developers.\n\nRelated: Justice Department Wastes Millions Through Grant Program Fraud\n\nHowever, Kushner and his staff on the new White House office of innovation will bring the kind of fire power and centralized focus that others in government cannot provide, as Axios noted today.\n\nIn a government where the Internal Revenue Service still depends on antiquated computer systems to process tax returns and ferret out fraud, the Medicare and Medicaid programs have lost hundreds of billions over the years through improper payments and theft. And immigration and enforcement agents must use paper files to track down illegal immigrants because their computers still aren’t up to speed.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times wrote in 2015 as part of a series of articles on ways to “Reboot America” to restore Americans’ faith in their institutions, “The federal government is a rudderless behemoth --- a massive $3.7 trillion a year enterprise that is struggling to come to grips with a fast-changing society, mind-boggling innovations in technology and business practices, and growing public impatience with bureaucratic inefficiency, waste and corruption.”\n\nThe series concluded that the only way to truly reengineer the federal government was to “embrace a cold-eyed business model that places productivity and accountability at the top of the list.”\n\nRelated: From Strip Clubs to Combat Ships, McCain Blasts $13 Billion in Pentagon Waste\n\nIf government leaders were truly interested in pioneering better ways of servicing the country and reducing the deficit and waste, Washington policymakers, bureaucrats and public employees’ unions “must somehow break free of their hidebound and self-defeating practices that reward stasis over progress and risk-taking,” the series argued.\n\nOver the years, many have proposed changes to improve the quality of government, dating back to the Hoover Commission of 1947 appointed by President Harry Truman.\n\n\n\nDemocratic President Bill Clinton, who put Vice President Al Gore in charge of the “Partnership to Reinvent Government” beginning in 1993, had some of the best results. Their goals included:\n\nPutting customers (the American taxpayers) first\n\nCutting red tape\n\nEmpowering employees to get results\n\nCutting government back to basics\n\n\n\nGore methodically asked for recommendations from stakeholders and others and two-thirds of the recommendations were adopted in Clinton’s first term. The results included the elimination of 426,000 federal positions, and a drive toward internet-based management, especially at the IRS and VA.\n\n\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence\n\nRepublican President George W. Bush urged lawmakers and bureaucrats to reduce red tape, but he had only modest victories to show for his efforts. Democratic President Barack Obama tried to streamline the federal bureaucracy, but he was blocked by senior lawmakers. His budget office also methodically benchmarked the efficiency of government departments in the areas of supply acquisitions, finance, information technology, personnel and property management.\n\nObama’s final term revealed just how much work remained to be done.\n\nThere were still billions of dollars of waste, fraud and improper spending, especially at the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. Outrageous management practices at the Veterans Affairs Department forced patients to wait weeks and even months for an appointment that cost many their lives.\n\nThere was poor overall monitoring of the performance of government workers and contractors. And there was an appalling lack of competent in-house technological and IT savvy that could have saved the Obama administration from its humiliating on-line rollout of the Affordable Care Act in October 2013.\n\nGovernment reform typically gets short shrift or provokes yawns on Capitol Hill or along the campaign trail, and Trump and the other Republican and Democratic candidates had relatively little to say about it during the 2016 campaign.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nSome government experts say that if a new president is serious about making fundamental change in government, he has only a brief window in which to press for change, before his influence begins to wane and opposition mounts.\n\nMax Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a preeminent research and advocacy group for the federal government, urged Trump and other presidential candidates to think seriously about government reform early in the campaign and to be ready to hit the ground running if they won election.\n\n“If you wait a year or two years into your term to figure out what you want to do on the management agenda, you’ve lost a considerable part of your runway for actually affecting real change,” Stier told The Fiscal Times at the start of the campaign. “We need to see administrations starting with clear management agendas in the same way they start with policy agendas.”"

    "text": "Still reeling from their health care reform debacle last week, congressional Republican leaders appear more willing to stiff President Trump on initial funding for his wall along the border with Mexico than risk a fight with Democrats that could result in a government shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) decided late last year to postpone final action on more than $1 trillion of discretionary spending for the 2017 fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30 in order to give the newly elected president an opportunity to put his stamp on spending priorities.\n\nRelated: 5 Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s 2018 Budget\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has declared Trump’s request for $1.4 billion in the current budget for preliminary planning for construction of the wall along nearly 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border a “poison pill” that would prompt a Democratic filibuster and the likelihood the spending bill would go down.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, told reporters Tuesday afternoon that Trump’s supplemental funding request will have to wait until later this year, when Congress turns to spending for fiscal 2018.\n\nHe said that leaders of the Senate and House are close to reaching a final agreement to keep the government operating through the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year, and suggested they didn’t want to gum things up with Trump’s request. Trump already has requested an additional $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018 to design the wall and set a construction timeline for arguably Trump’s most expensive and controversial infrastructure project – one that could cost $25 billion overall.\n\nLawmakers are growing increasingly anxious as they approach an April 28 deadline, when the continuing resolution under which the government is currently operating will expire without a replacement spending package. Without new spending authority, the government will begin to shut down the following day.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico Than He Saves\n\nTrump and his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, caused an uproar March 16 with a budget request for fiscal 2018 that includes $54 billion in additional funding for defense and dollar-for-dollar offsetting cuts in most government departments except for Defense and Homeland Security. The Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and foreign aid programs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies would take significant hits of as much as 31 percent.\n\nTrump is also hoping to squeeze an additional $30 billion for defense out of this year’s spending that would necessitate billions of dollars more of cuts in medical research grants, education and foreign aid.\n\nWith GOP lawmakers in no mood for another high profile showdown with the Democrats over their pet domestic programs, Trump may be in for another big disappointment."

    "text": "When the White House released its sketch of a 2018 budget proposal earlier this month, outlining major cuts to things like medical research and Community Development Block Grants, the reaction was swift and brutal. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle promised that the huge reductions in popular programs would never become law.\n\nThe administration doesn’t appear to have learned a lot from the experience, though. The Associated Press reports the White House has been floating a plan on Capitol Hill for the 2017 spending bill that needs to be completed before April 29 in order to avoid a government shutdown. In it are $18 billion in cuts targeted in large part...at medical research and Community Development Block Grants.\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nUnder the plan, which is described as a list of options and not necessarily official White House policy, the National Institutes of Health would lose $1.8 billion, and the CDBG program, which states use to help fund a wide range of programs including Meals on Wheel and after school programs for at-risk children, would lose $3 billion.\n\nIn an interesting twist, the administration is apparently also considering a $500 million cut in the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, which focuses on infrastructure programs. Trump has repeatedly pledged to ramp up infrastructure spending in the US.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader effort to get Congress to acquiesce to Trump’s request for an immediate infusion of $30 billion into the Pentagon as a down payment on what he has promised will be one of the biggest surges in military spending in the nation’s history. He also wants a first installment of cash for the signature element of his immigration crackdown -- a massive wall on the US-Mexico border.\n\nIn negotiations over how to handle the April 28th expiration of the continuing resolution that is allowing the federal government to continue spending money, the young Trump White House is entering territory that has proved hazardous for far more experienced administrations. With the exception of George W. Bush, every president going back to Ronald Reagan has experienced at least one government shutdown over spending disagreements, and some have faced several.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants to Overhaul an Understaffed Government Desperate for Leadership\n\nIt’s a tough assignment for an administration packed with political novices who have already stumbled badly in their first attempt to manage a major piece of legislation: Trump and company were forced to watch helplessly as the American Health Care Act, meant to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, died in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nNow, they face a potential battle with many of the same members of Congress who helped derail the AHCA, members of the House Freedom Caucus. Representing the rightmost wing of the GOP in the House, they wield considerable influence within the party because there are enough of them to deprive House Speaker Paul Ryan of a majority if they decline to back him on the House floor.\n\nIn the past, the Freedom Caucus has used must-pass legislation, like government funding bills or debt limit increases, to push specific agenda items that may or may not be shared by the broader Congress, such defunding the ACA or Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows, said over the weekend that the group doesn’t expect problems with funding the government.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\nBut experts, like budget wars veteran Stan Collender, executive vice president at Qorvis MSLGROUP, note that history suggests that many of Meadows’ members will be reluctant to pass up an opportunity to press for one of their priorities. The problem is that the rest of the party knows that if they cave into the Freedom Caucus demands, the bill will be filibustered by Senate Democrats.\n\nIn the end, there is a strong possibility that the Trump administration is going to need support not just from Republicans but also from a solid number of Democrats to overcome conservative resistance in the House.\n\nThat means even a temporary spending resolution that slashes medical research and CDBGs is going nowhere fast, even with the GOP in control of both houses of Congress."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/28/Trump-Picks-His-Pen-Eviscerate-Obama-s-Rules-Climate-Protection",
    "text": "When President Obama was faced with a Congress unwilling to work with him on virtually anything, he reminded the country that the chief executive has other ways of affecting the way the nation does business. Specifically, he said, he had a “phone and a pen” and proceeded, much to Republicans’ fury, to overhaul much of the way the federal government does business through executive orders.\n\nNow his predecessor, faced with a humiliating legislative defeat in his first major effort to enact a new law, is following the same path, though arguably in reverse. Donald Trump on Tuesday is expected to sign an executive order that will roll back a vast array of Obama-era requirements meant to protect the climate from global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the country’s investment in renewable energy.\n\nRelated: Trump Administration Takes Aim at Funding for Sanctuary Cities\n\nThat order follows close on the heels of a second, less-noticed, one that revoked rules put in place by Obama to ensure that companies winning large federal contracts do not have a history of violating labor laws and workplace safety requirements.\n\nThe two back-to-back orders are just the latest in a flurry of activity from the new administration, which has used executive orders to push its policy agenda forward in areas as diverse as immigration, regulatory reform, and enforcement of the Affordable Care Act’s insurance coverage mandates.\n\nThe order expected Tuesday will have sweeping consequences for the way the Environmental Protection Agency enforces federal laws related to carbon emissions and will absolve federal agencies of a requirement that they consider the environmental impact of their actions when making regulatory decisions.\n\nThe rule will undo a ban on the leasing of federal land for coal mining, an effort taken by the Obama administration as part of a push to move the country away from carbon-intensive fuels that create significant pollution and toward more renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.\n\nRelated: Why Another Government Shutdown Is Suddenly in the Cards\n\nAn anonymous administration official told The Washington Post the new policy was meant to make the country “energy independent” and denied that the move represents an abandonment of efforts to combat climate change. “When it comes to climate change, we want to take our course and do it in our own form and fashion,” the official said.\n\nThe order is not the first one Trump has signed paring back environment-related regulations, but it is the most sweeping. He previously signed a rule that removed restrictions preventing coal mines from polluting streams and other waterways and recalculated the royalties that private companies pay for mining on federal lands.\n\nMuch of the new rule focuses on undoing restrictions the Obama administration placed on coal-burning power plants. The new president has made the reviving the coal mining industry a focal point of his new administration. This despite the fact that coal mining represents a tiny fraction of overall employment in the US, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and that even top executives in the coal industry believe the effort to bring jobs back is doomed.\n\nThe order signed Monday, though less broad in scope, was also aimed at undoing efforts by the previous president that had frustrated conservatives. The main target of the action was President Obama’s July 2014 Executive Order 13673, entitled “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces.” The Obama order, among other things, imposed strict transparency requirements on federal contractors with regard to information they were required to share with employees about their compensation.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants to Overhaul an Understaffed Government Desperate for Leadership\n\nCongress had already taken steps to undo the Obama-era rule, which detractors said created a “blacklist” of companies that would be barred from receiving federal contracts.\n\nWhile Republicans, by and large, cheered Trump’s latest efforts to undo the Obama legacy, Democrats were dismayed -- particularly by the move to slash environmental rules.\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons told Politico that the GOP had reached “peak climate science denial,” adding, “\"They’re going to extraordinary lengths to deny this meteor that is global warming catapulting toward the Earth. I’m scared stiff. My kids won’t be able to solve this problem if we don’t tackle it right now because it will be too late in 20 years.\""

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/28/Controversial-Medicare-Payment-Reforms-May-Hit-Wall-Trump-s-HHS",
    "text": "President Trump promised repeatedly during the campaign to crack down on government waste, fraud and abuse, and the $590 billion a year Medicare program is a good place to start.\n\nAfter years of losing tens of billions of dollars through Medicare fraud by doctors, nurses and patients, the Obama administration two years ago launched an aggressive effort by the Justice Department, the FBI, inspectors general and the Department of Health and Human Services to crack down on fraudulent billings and activity and recover billions of dollars.\n\nRelated: Crackdown on Medicare Fraud Is Producing Some Impressive Results\n\nThe Obama administration and congressional Republicans and Democrats took added steps in 2015 that potentially could discourage overbilling and other fraudulent activities by changing the way doctors are reimbursed for their services. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) was designed to shift the medical system away from tradition “fee-for-service” and towards rewarding the quality of service in a bid to save hundreds of billions in the coming decades.\n\nBut while the Obama administration took an important step last October by issuing the proposed new regulations to implement the law, they could be stopped in their tracks under the new Republican leadership at HHS.\n\nFormer Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the new HHS secretary, is a sharp critic of the move to a “value-based” system of payments to physicians and argues that they could seriously undermine the traditional doctor-patient relationship.\n\nPrice, a retired orthopedic surgeon, wrote in a letter to CMS last fall that the final MACRA rule “deserves careful scrutiny in light of the serious concerns’ that he and other members of the Congressional Doctors Caucus had raised.\n\nRelated: Doctors and Nurses Charged in Massive $900 Million Medicare Fraud\n\n“We are deeply concerned about how this rule could affect the patient-doctor relationship, and I look forward to carefully reviewing it in the coming days to determine whether the Administration has addressed those concerns and put the interests of patients first,” Price wrote at the time.\n\nNow Price, a Tea Party conservative and arch foe of Obama-era policies, controls the rulemaking at CMS. Although the new Trump administration has yet to make any pronouncement about MARC, it is very likely there will be significant and wholesale changes made to the proposed rule – if it is not blocked altogether.\n\nA new policy brief by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation issued Monday found the medical world sharply divided over the new rules and suggests that the debate could drag on for months, if not years.\n\n“This shift is potentially transformational but presents a serious implementation and logistical challenges,” the new report stated. “Not all doctors embrace the change, and the philosophical and economic underpinnings of value-based payment--and the mechanisms to achieve it--continue to be vigorously debated.”\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nMACRA is one of many regulatory and rulemaking controversies that fly under the public’s radar and yet could have a monumental impact on the way the medical profession and health care industry do business in the future. In 2015 Medicare paid physicians and other clinicians around $130 billion, or a fifth of total Medicare spending. So the stakes in changing the system of reimbursing doctors and hospitals cannot be exaggerated.\n\nHealthcare reformists for years have complained about Medicare’s fee-for-service payment system that allows hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers to seek reimbursement from the government for every test, examination, and treatment they provide to the elderly.\n\nThat approach has generated a blizzard of paperwork and incentive to doctors to run up the volume of their charges – even when it can mean ordering unnecessary tests or treatment – to maximize their income. Doctors have long complained about the inadequacy of Medicare reimbursement for their services, and find virtue in maximizing treatment.\n\nBut those practices drive up the government’s Medicare costs and encourage fraud and other gaming of the system.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe Obama administration and a bipartisan majority in Congress opted in April 2015 for an alternative to fee for service that based payment on “based on performance metrics, patient experience, patient outcomes, and public health improvements,” according to the Robert Wood Johnson study. Doctors and other health care providers would no longer be allowed to operate “untethered from accountability,” the report said.\n\nThe report spans the many years of debate and trial and error and highlights many of the arguments raised both for and against the new approach.\n\nHere are three of the most compelling arguments for and against MACRA, based on the new report:\n\nThe Pros\n\nThe new approach is consistent with a move in the private sector and government over the past decade toward a “value-based payment” that rewards quality of service and results rather than taking a more piecemeal approach regardless of the clinical need or the appropriateness of those services.\n\nRelated: The 10 States With the Worst Medicare Waste\n\nThat “inappropriate” or excessive care is common within the Medicare program and greatly adds to the health care costs of the government, businesses, and families.\n\nThe current fee-for-service system dates to 1992 and is based on a complex coded formula that estimates the amount of work required of physicians to perform hundreds of different services The CMS administers the fee system, but it is based on calculations provided by the American Medical Association (AMA).\n\n\n\nSome critics including the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have complained that this approach “deputizes” the medical profession to set the price list – essentially allowing the fox to guard the hen house.\n\nThere is flexibility in the new approach that will give the medical profession – especially small practices -- plenty of time to adjust. To make sure the reforms aren’t overly burdensome, CMS has adopted an approach that sets 2017 and 2018 as “transition” years and that allows doctors and clinicians to “pick the pace” at which they gradually shift to the new system.\n\nThe Cons\n\nWhile the change potentially is transformational, it poses serious implementation and logistical challenges. Many doctors including HHS secretary Price have bridled at changing a reimbursement system that has served them and their patients well for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new system is hopelessly complicated and involves the choice of two different tracks. One is called the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or “MIPS.” The other is called the Alternative Payment Model, or “APM,” and offers more financial incentives.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome critics complain that MACRA is designed to push doctors who practice on their own or in small groups into larger groups and other payment models. Many prefer their current arrangements while others take issue with the whole notion of changing or incentivizing doctor behavior through performance measurements and financial incentives.\n\nRelated: Doctors and Nurses Charged in Massive $900 Million Medicare Fraud\n\nDoctors who bill Medicare more than $30,000 a year and provide care for more than 100 Medicare patients annually can opt for either program. Clinicians who take part in MIPS will be scored on an overall 1-100 scale consisting of four performance categories: quality of care, practice improvement, advancing care information and cost or resource use.\n\nAPMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a whole population – if you can follow that. The goal of the law and the final rules is to have APMs, over time, encompass entire populations. CMS estimates that 70,000 to 120,000 clinicians in 2017, and 125,000-250,000 in 2018 will join advanced APMs and qualify for a 5 percent incentive payment and a more generous annual fee increase. But many doctors are confused about exactly how the system will work.\n\nSkeptics insist there isn’t conclusive proof that this approach yields improvements in care or general public health."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Trump-Administration-Takes-Aim-Funding-Sanctuary-Cities",
    "text": "Ever since Donald Trump began railing against undocumented immigrants at the beginning of his presidential campaign, so-called “sanctuary cities” have been a target of some of his strongest condemnation. He declared that as president he would withhold federal funding from jurisdictions that decline to share information about undocumented individuals with federal immigration authorities. And on Monday, his administration detailed one of its plans for doing just that.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, himself a strong supporter of tougher immigration laws, announced that the Department of Justice would deny grants administered through its Office of Justice Programs to jurisdictions that do not comply with 8 USC 1373. That particular segment of the U.S. Code says no government entity in the country may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”\n\nRelated: As AG, Sessions Could Radically Influence Immigration Enforcement\n\nIn his remarks, Sessions announced new DOJ guidance that “requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding of grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants. The Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw-back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates Section 1373.”\n\nWhether the clawbacks would be retroactive to grants already provided or limited to future grants only was unclear from the wording of the Attorney General’s remarks. A request for clarification sent to DOJ had not received a reply at the time this story was posted.\n\nIn 2016, OJP oversaw 2,995 grants that translated into $3.86 billion in funds to state and local law enforcement agencies. In his remarks, Sessions said that the grants would top $4.1 billion this year.\n\nThe OJP grants range in size from the tiny -- $3,674 to the Custer County, Colorado, Sheriff’s Department through the Bureau of Justice Assistance Small Agency Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program -- to the massive -- $264.3 million to the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services through the Victims of Crime Act.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nJurisdictions throughout the country are divided on the effect that Section 1373 compliance has on local law enforcement efforts. Some believe, as Sessions does, that “when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted for criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk – especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators.”\n\nOthers, however, believe that if local law enforcement officials are seen by the undocumented community as an extension of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they will be less likely to cooperate with police, either by reporting crimes, warning authorities of potential criminal activity or providing other information police find valuable.\n\nWhat there is little disagreement on, though, is the importance of OJP grants to many local police departments. The money is often used to fund technical upgrades, training and other resources that might otherwise be beyond the budgetary capacity of smaller departments.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Trump’s ‘Merit-Based’ Immigration System Would Look Like\n\nWhile major metropolitan areas may have the financial resources to maintain sanctuary city policies in the face of the loss of OJP funding, the administration’s new stance could force tougher choices on smaller municipalities, whose law enforcement agencies rely more heavily on the DOJ for funding.\n\nThat’s the pressure Trump wants to apply to local officials, and it isn’t immediately obvious that other federal grant programs managed by different arms of the executive branch couldn’t be weaponized against sanctuary cities in the future."

    "text": "In a bid to make good on a campaign pledge to Appalachia, President Trump is scheduled to take another big step this week towards scrapping the Obama administration’s efforts to curb industrial carbon emissions that critics charge have seriously hurt the struggling coal industry and tossed tens of thousands of miners out of work.\n\nTrump will sign an executive order on Tuesday repealing President Obama’s Clean Power Plan designed to slash greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants by a third in the coming decade and fulfill the U.S. commitment to an international global warming agreement reached in Paris in late 2015. It will be Trump’s second executive action since February aimed at shredding government regulations restricting coal productions and surface mining techniques that pollute streams, groundwater and wildlife.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Rollback on Clean Air and Water Rules Could Raise Health Care Costs\n\nHowever, a top coal industry executive is warning Trump to “temper” his promises of new job creations to avoid setting up industry officials and unemployed miner workers for a major disappointment if the coal industry fails to make a big comeback.\n\nRobert Murray, the founder and chief executive of Murray Energy, the largest privately held coal mining company in the U.S., says Trump’s election has been a boon to the coal industry, and that he is moving in the right direction in trying to strip away Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and mining agency regulations that have hastened the demise of King Coal.\n\nSince Obama’s election in 2008, more than 50 coal mining companies have gone bankrupt and more than 400 coal-fired power plants were shuttered. Coal mining employment plummeted from 127,745 in 2008 to only 98,5005 in 2015, according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration.\n\nRelated: Environmentalists’ Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True\n\nBut Murray, who endorsed Trump last May and raised money for his campaign, cautioned in an interview with The Guardian that market forces including stiff competition from cheaper shale gas production and new technology and more mechanized techniques for mining coal have contributed mightily to the sharp decline in employment throughout mining states like West Virginia and Kentucky that supported Trump in the November election.\n\nMurray said that “I would not say it’s a good time in the coal industry,” although there have been some improvements in the past year.\n\nHowever, the politically active coal mining executive said he stressed during a meeting with Trump that there were limits to what could be done through administrative action and rule changing to bring back the industry to where it once was in terms of jobs. “I suggested that he temper his expectations,” Murray told The Guardian. “Those are my exact words. He can’t bring them back.”\n\nRelated: Are Coal Miners Headed for Heartbreak Under the GOP?\n\nScott Pruitt, the new EPA administrator, said during an appearance Sunday on ABC News’ This Week that Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to repeal Obama’s Clean Power Plan aimed at sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aging coal-fired power plants throughout the country. The 2015 rule has been held in abeyance since last year while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by a dozen coal-friendly, largely Republican states and more than 100 companies.\n\nPruitt, the former attorney general for the state of Oklahoma, was a leader in challenging that and other EPA regulations in court before he was tapped by Trump to head the premier agency responsible for clean air and water regulations and efforts to contain climate change. Trump has described climate change as a “hoax,” while Pruitt contends the Paris climate accord is a “bad deal” for the U.S. and the mining industry – and one that has driven up electricity costs.\n\n“So we’ve penalized ourselves through lost jobs while China and India didn’t take steps to address the issue internationally,” Pruitt said. “So Paris was just a bad deal, in my estimation.\n\nAsked by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos whether Trump’s executive action will bring back coal jobs, Pruitt replied: “I think absolutely it will. It will bring back manufacturing jobs across the country, coal jobs across the country.”"

    "text": "The clock is already ticking on the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s next showdown with recalcitrant Republican lawmakers.\n\nJust days after suffering a humiliating defeat on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers must look ahead to April 28, when the Continuing Resolution under which the federal government is operating will expire, meaning that without a replacement in place, huge swathes of the federal government will have to shut down the following day.\n\nAccording to the House calendar, members have only 12 legislative days scheduled between now and then to come to an agreement.\n\nRelated: Chair of Freedom Caucus Open to Deficit-Expanding Tax Cuts\n\nThe question that will be on the minds of Washington policymakers as well as the financial markets is whether the hard-right conservatives of the House Freedom Caucus, after facing down and embarrassing their own president and speaker once in his first 100 days, will decide to do it again next month.\n\nIn the past, the Freedom Caucus and its allies have made their agreement to spending bills contingent on the acceptance poison-pill amendments, such as demands that the legislation defund the Affordable Care Act or Planned Parenthood. And many longtime observers of Congress expect them to do so again.\n\n“You would expect the Freedom Caucus to make a stand -- to be emboldened by the success of the health care thing,” said Stan Collender, a respected expert on the U.S. federal budget process and executive vice president at Qorvis MSLGROUP.\n\nAt that point, Trump and Ryan will have a choice: agree to the Freedom Caucus’ demands and watch the bill get filibustered by Senate Democrats, or try to strike a compromise with House Democrats, likely resulting in a bill that gets filibustered by Senate Republicans.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\n“I find it hard to see how we don’t get a shutdown, at least for a few days, if only for symbolic reasons,” Collender said. “The question at that point comes down to ‘Who gets blamed?’ Republicans might be willing to take the blame over Planned Parenthood, because for their voters that’s red meat. Democrats might be willing to take the blame too, because preserving Planned Parenthood is a campaign issue for them.”\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina said on Sunday that there wouldn’t be a problem funding the government next month, but Collender urged taking that promise with a grain of salt, saying that the members of Meadows’ group have learned not to telegraph a shutdown so far in advance.\n\nWriting for Axios on Monday morning, Mike Allen reported that senior Republicans have come to view a potential shutdown as “more likely than not.”\n\nThe administration has signaled its intent to pivot from its health care debacle to a major effort to reform the tax code. However, given the complexity of that effort and the tight timeline leading to a potential shutdown, it seems safe to assume that the fight over whether to authorize spending for the remainder of the fiscal year will dominate attention in the House for much of the next month.\n\nThe Trump team is said to be looking for its first major legislative win, but while Trump might be hoping to have some sort of proactive legislative victory on the books in his first 100 days, it’s looking more likely that any win, if it comes at all, will consist of simply avoiding disaster."

    "text": "In private, Mark Cuban has started discussing his role in national politics with his family.\n\nHe told Business Insider, for instance, that he spoke with loved ones about his decision to campaign on the trail for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\n\"We discussed how much of a threat I believe Trump to be,\" Cuban said in an email. \"We discussed why it was important to me to get involved — that if I could have an impact and didn't try, it would have left me guessing forever.\"\n\nAnd, as Cuban said, his family feels \"like we started on the right path\" to \"have a platform and voice for the future.\"\n\nCuban, 58, is a self-made billionaire businessman and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. And he seems more serious than ever about running for president.\n\nCuban refrained from engaging much in politics before the 2016 campaign cycle. But in the past two years he has openly flirted with a White House bid, teasing journalists with tantalizing words about his aspirations.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Cuban was shutting down questions about whether he'd seek the presidency one day, flatly rejecting the notion, as he did at the September presidential debate.\n\nBut something changed. It was, as Cuban put it, \"obvious\": the election — unpredictability — of Trump.\n\n\"What I do depends on how things play out for the country,\" Cuban said referring to a 2020 attempt at unseating Trump.\n\nLike Trump, Cuban introduced himself to American households first as a prominent businessman and later through a reality-TV show. He had no formal history in politics, only suddenly emerging on the national political stage last year. His strategy for gaining political prominence was oddly similar to Trump's — deliver hot, unadulterated takes on cable TV, outlets like CNBC, Fox News, and CNN, and on Twitter.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: 5 Essential Rules for Starting a Business\n\nYet Cuban does not embrace the comparison.\n\n\"He talked about running for office for 30 years,\" Cuban said. \"I started talking about politics this year, after avoiding them the last almost 20 years, because I thought it was important to do so.\"\n\nIn conversations with Business Insider, Cuban's longtime friends said they were initially surprised to see Cuban get involved politically, but they added that they could certainly now envision him entering the fray in 2020. And while it would be a climb to the White House for the tech titan, campaign experts have laid out a path Cuban could take to find himself in the Oval Office.\n\nRising profile\n\nWith Trump's improbable rise to the presidency, there's been no shortage of ultrawealthy, prominent business people rumored to be considering a run of their own in 2020.\n\nThere's Oprah Winfrey, Mark Zuckerberg, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and Disney CEO Bob Iger, all of whom have fed the idea that Trump could face a fellow executive in his prospective 2020 reelection bid. But no nonpolitician has put him or herself out there quite like Cuban.\n\nCuban, who grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, moved to Dallas in the early 1980s, finding work as a bartender. He caught his first big break after he started a software company, MicroSolutions, which he sold in 1990 for $6 million. But his biggest break came after he founded AudioNet, which became Broadcast.com, the streaming site he sold to Yahoo at the peak of the dot-com boom in 1999 for more than $5 billion in stock. A year later, he'd buy the Dallas Mavericks and become one of the NBA's most recognizable, and outspoken, owners.\n\nHe showed minimal interest in politics in his years since striking it rich — until 2016, when his political presence grew exponentially after he started roiling Trump along the campaign trail.\n\nInitially, Cuban was warm to Trump, speaking about him in positive terms. But that eventually changed, and Cuban found himself delivering blistering stump speeches for Clinton and ripping Trump on a number of issues, including his wealth.\n\nWhen Trump won the presidency, Cuban went quiet again, ceasing his attacks on the country's newly elected leader.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban to Young Millennials: Live Cheap – Clothes, Cars Don’t Matter\n\nThat lasted only so long, though. When Trump ignited chaos after signing his executive order on travel from certain majority-Muslim countries, Cuban appeared on several networks to voice his displeasure with both the decision and the president. He unleashed a bevy of tweets at the commander-in-chief, staking out a place as the de-facto leader of opposition among the small community of ultrawealthy business people.\n\nAnd Cuban has been merciless since. He has called Trump \"the Zoolander president.\" He has suggested Trump wouldn't be able to find the \"C\" if he was spotted the \"A\" and \"B.\"\n\nCuban, in a now deleted tweet, said he was \"crushing\" Trump because the president \"earned it.\"\n\nThat appeared to get under Trump's skin.\n\nLast month, Trump fired a shot at Cuban on Twitter, suggesting he was not \"smart enough\" to win the presidency — a claim Chris Sacca, the billionaire venture capitalist and \"Shark Tank\" costar, seemed to disagree with in an email to Business Insider.\n\n\"Only Mark can speak to his long-term ambitions in politics,\" Sacca said. \"But unlike Donald, Mark is smart, reads extensively, and is willing to ask others for help and listen to their advice on issues that matter.\"\n\nBut Trump isn't alone in his criticism. Cuban's newfound political platform has left him with a growing set of critics. One of them is Frank Zaccanelli, a Dallas real-estate mogul who was a part of the Mavericks ownership group headed by Texas billionaire Ross Perot Jr., who sold the team to Cuban in 2000.\n\nZaccanelli, who calls himself a \"pretty good student of Mark Cuban\" although he \"wouldn't say we're best friends or get along great,\" blasted Cuban for some of his statements and decisions during his de-facto tenure as Trump's foil in the business world.\n\n\"What he's doing now has put himself out there for a lot of criticism,\" Zaccanelli said.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Here’s What You Need to Do Before You Start Investing\n\nThe former Mavericks executive was particularly dismayed by Cuban's February tweet to a season ticket holder who was upset by the owner's comments about Trump and said he would turn in his season tickets and boycott games.\n\nCuban's response? \"DM me and I'll help get it done.\"\n\n\"The way I read it was that if you don't want to be a season ticket holder, I don't want you to be one,\" Zaccanelli said, suggesting that Cuban's political platform has been a drag on his businesses, particularly his pro-basketball team.\n\nBut Cuban disputed the assertion.\n\n\"For every hate email there was a positive one as well,\" he said of the response to his political opining, adding that he didn't see his politics becoming a drag on the Mavericks because \"remember, Clinton won Dallas County.\"\n\nA recent poll showed that the split sentiment in Cuban's inbox could be indicative of a larger one. The results of that poll, conducted by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, found that Cuban would be in a neck-and-neck race against the sitting president in a prospective one-on-one 2020 election.\n\nTom Jensen, the pollster, said Cuban proved to be \"pretty competitive given his comparatively low level of name recognition at this point.\"\n\n'He needs to hire someone to help create the entire campaign'\n\nFor Cuban to have a serious chance at securing the White House, he would need to start taking policy positions and filling out the bare bones of a campaign infrastructure soon, campaign experts told Business Insider.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban May Be the Next Billionaire to Seek the White House\n\nAnd unlike Trump, Cuban would have to run more of a \"traditional campaign,\" said Terry Sullivan, Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign manager.\n\n\"He definitely comes across as a more cerebral and thoughtful candidate than Donald Trump, and he's clearly got a better, self-made billionaire story,\" Sullivan told Business Insider. \"But ... because of that, he's not willing to set his hair on fire to make news in the same way. So it makes it a little more difficult for him to cut through [the noise] than a Trump [type].\"\n\nThe first steps to laying out a campaign infrastructure, Sullivan said, would be to get informed on the issues and begin to take positions on key areas of policy.\n\nCuban has already started to do that. He put forth a proposal to fix the Affordable Care Act, and he hammered away at a jobs platform heavily focused on dealing with what he sees as an upcoming wave of job loss due to automation, necessitating \"macro\"-level changes to economic policies.\n\nShould he decide to run, Cuban will also need to address what the future of his business empire would look like — something he said he has already considered.\n\n\"I have so many private business investments that it would be impossible to sell them,\" Cuban told Business Insider. \"I would put them in a blind trust but make it clear I would still be available on a limited basis for those companies. It wouldn't be fair to those companies if I just bailed on them.\n\n\"I would also be very transparent,\" he went on, seeming to take a jab at Trump, who has come under fire from ethics experts who have said Trump has not come close to fully complying with conflicts-of-interest laws and severing his business interests. \"Truly transparent about what I was doing. And yes, I would make my returns available.\"\n\nSullivan said the next step would be to \"get the media's attention that you're a serious candidate.\" He suggested Cuban start traveling to states like Iowa to hint he may be serious about getting in the fray.\n\n\"The amount of attention he would draw by doing a Lincoln Dinner in Davenport, Iowa, would be huge,\" Sullivan said. \"Those are the kind of things he has to start with.\"\n\nSullivan added that Cuban should \"absolutely\" hire a team of political advisers to develop a long-term strategy for him if he is sincerely interested in pursuing the White House.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: 6 Tips for the Powerball Winner\n\nCuban, Sullivan said, should also \"start at the top\" and find someone, preferably with experience, who could manage his campaign. From there, he could consult that person to make other hires.\n\n\"You reach out to people who've done it before,\" Sullivan said. \"I mean, he shouldn't be out there worrying about hiring — I'm going to hire a press person here or a TV guy here or a policy guy here. He needs to hire someone to help create the entire campaign.\"\n\nThe core team would also have to come up with a plan for victory. At this stage, Sullivan said it isn't clear whether Cuban would be better off running as an independent or a Democrat.\n\nCuban is not registered with a political party, and he would have to commission additional polls to gather data to see what his best route would be at this early stage.\n\n\"Plus, it is so early in the Trump administration. You can start laying the groundwork on things you need to do, but it doesn't necessarily mean you need to make some clear decisions,\" Sullivan said. \"You go into a more preliminary mode now, where you just put yourself in a position to succeed and then make commitments for closer in on how you're going to run.\"\n\nCuban seems content dishing out his takes on cable news and Twitter. But this isn't a long-term model for someone who's going to have to go a more traditional route, Sullivan said.\n\n\"Smart tactics are not necessarily smart strategy,\" he added.\n\nReed Galen, deputy campaign manager for Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 reelection bid, told Business Insider that Cuban is going to have to figure out how much of his own money he wants to spend, which he suggested might need to be upwards of $500 million if he decides to run an independent presidential bid.\n\n\"He won't have the party apparatus helping raise money,\" said Galen, now the owner of Jedburghs, a political consultancy firm. \"There would be people from both parties who would likely work for him. But the traditional networks that raise money for these people are at least initially out of bounds or unavailable. So how much of his own money is he willing to spend?\"\n\nGalen said Cuban needs to hire experts who have good political instincts and experience, can convince Cuban against pursuing a bad idea, and who understand that Cuban's campaign will have to be \"unique to his style.\"\n\nIt's also a matter of figuring out who Cuban's base would be and where he would compete on the map. As an independent, he would need to run essentially a 50-state campaign, depending on his endgame. As a Democrat, the map would look slightly different. Ballot access would also be a huge question, and Galen said starting early on that would be essential to an independent bid.\n\n\"Who is the base for a candidate like Mark Cuban?\" Galen asked. \"A lot of research and a lot of work needs to go into that, because you've got to figure out who you've got to go talk to.\"\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: The Lesson Investors Can Learn From China\n\n\"What's the goal? Is the goal to get to 270? Or is the goal to get to a draw between the two major parties and an independent candidate and throw it to Congress? And what does that look like?\"\n\nGalen said that the states Cuban should most closely look to include Texas, where the strategist said he would likely have some home-state advantage, as well as some of the states where the past two presidential races were closely fought. Places like Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Florida should be key targets.\n\nIn states like those, Galen said Cuban could find himself carving out \"30% in the middle,\" possibly enough to win in a plurality.\n\nCuban also needs to figure out exactly what his message is to \"invigorate and bring together a very divided and ... nervous country,\" Galen said.\n\n\"How is he going to bring a very tribalistic political society?\" he asked. \"Republicans and Democrats. How're you going to start to peel off those people who have decided that the two-party system doesn't work anymore and are willing to take an independent as a legitimate choice.\"\n\nGalen did acknowledge that Cuban \"would be a fascinating addition to the presidential contenders list.\" He also provided Cuban with advice on what the absolutely first thing he should do is.\n\n\"What I'd have him do is read 'What It Takes' from Richard Ben Cramer,\" Galen said, referring to a book on the 1988 presidential election. \"Because there is not going to be any better opus on what it means to run for president than that book.\n\n\"Short of doing it, of course.\"\n\n'He thinks 10 moves ahead'\n\nThe idea that a Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among the political class is stunning to his lifelong friends.\n\nThen again, so was the fact he became such a prominent surrogate for Clinton and inserted himself right in the middle of the heated 2016 discussion.\n\n\"It's hard to believe,\" said Todd Reidbord, the president of Pittsburgh-based Walnut Capital, who has been a close friend of Cuban's since the two grew up together in Mt. Lebanon, a prominent Pittsburgh suburb. \"The whole thing is like a dream ... None of us could've ever predicted that. But that's Mark.\"\n\nReidbord described his friend as \"unpredictable\" and explained how he was \"totally\" shocked when Cuban was blasting Trump as a top Clinton surrogate, elevating himself in the political world in the process. When Cuban stumped for the Democratic presidential nominee in Pittsburgh, Reidbord was there to see it firsthand.\n\nIt would be surprising to Reidbord if Cuban decided to take that extra step and seek the presidency. But at this point, nothing really surprises Reidbord about his old pal anymore.\n\n\"Every time I've ever tried to guess what he's going to do next,\" he said, \"I've never guessed right.\"\n\nStu Chaban, another longtime friend of Cuban from Mt. Lebanon, said he's confident the billionaire won't be shy about seeking the White House if it's something he genuinely desires.\n\n\"If it's the right thing for him and what he wants, he'll do it,\" Chaban said.\n\nIn a sense, Chaban said it's going to come down to one thing: timing.\n\nRegardless, those who know him best expect that he's calculating his next moves.\n\n\"Mark is a chess player,\" Reidbord said. \"He thinks 10 moves ahead. I'm not sure that Trump is thinking 10 moves ahead. Mark certainly is.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/27/Now-It-s-Democrats-Turn-Make-Health-Care-Push-Medicare-All",
    "text": "Progressive Democrats aren’t wasting a minute after the demise of TrumpCare. Buoyed by how the debate cemented a federal role in the health care system — it was untenable for Republicans to simply repeal Obamacare and return to the Bush-era status quo of health care as a privilege for the wealthy — they’re moving quickly to offer an actual alternative, a Medicare-for-all single payer system.\n\nBernie Sanders, who championed such a system throughout his presidential run, is going to introduce a bill, and this time he will have far more co-sponsors in the Senate than previous efforts. Elizabeth Warren voiced support for single payer at a town hall last week, and so did Rhode Island’s senators over the weekend. The deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, Keith Ellison, is a Medicare for All co-sponsor, along with 72 House members. And numerous progressive organizations are on board with the push.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nIn less realistic moments, some have wondered whether Donald Trump and his ideologically un-rooted supporters would come aboard the single payer train. While Trump has offhandedly promised universal coverage, you would go broke waiting for him to fulfill that. It makes no sense to expect Republicans who failed to repeal the current system because of fealty to free-market ideals to now turn over one-sixth of the economy to the government. It’s far more likely that Trump will burn down the current system to force through bad ideas like selling deregulated insurance across state lines, shifting costs to patients and adding work requirements to Medicaid.\n\nThat doesn’t make building support for single payer a useless exercise. In fact, it makes it more urgent, even responsible. Democrats have had a hard time the past several election cycles giving voters a specific reason to put them in charge again. As the minority party, this shouldn’t be difficult. You come up with a roster of ideas and paint an alternative vision of how the country could conduct its affairs.\n\nMedicare for All has the benefit of being really easy to understand, leveraging an existing program that is reasonably popular. You can explain the underlying logic as well. The health system in America has devolved into a multi-sided market of competing monopolies seeking negotiating advantage. But you cannot get bigger than everyone. The government has a unique opportunity to clarify the system and use its bargaining power to give everyone the right to health care — at a more affordable cost.\n\nRelated: Can Trump and Dems Find Common Ground on Health Care?\n\nDefining principles directly and challenging the opposition in a war of ideas is simply how politics should work. It gives grassroots supporters confidence that their elected leaders share a vision for the future rather than just a discardable ideology of opposition. Republicans will call it a government takeover, and Democrats will call the GOP’s ideas heartless abandonment or cruel bankrupting of the sick. Let’s see who wins.\n\nThe problem has been that Democrats have made governing promises when out of power in the past only to abandon them when in a position to achieve them. The Employee Free Choice Act, which sought to protect workers’ right to unionize and was organized labor’s biggest priority, had the support of nearly every Democrat before Barack Obama; when Democrats could actually make it happen that support vanished. This breeds cynicism among the base, and if Democrats try the same thing with single payer the backlash will be even worse. That’s also true of savvy pronouncements to support single payer as an “opening bid” in a negotiation. Die-hard supporters don’t want to see their dream elevated expressly to be traded away.\n\nIt should also be understood that single payer is the easiest to explain of a host of similar measures that can bring sanity to health care markets. For example, in California, where the state legislature is pushing a single payer bill, gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom has vowed to campaign on a universal health care program — not just insurance — that has echoes of both managed care and the socialized medicine of Britain’s National Health Service. It’s modeled on a program called Healthy San Francisco that allows anyone, regardless of insurance or immigration status, to visit a community health center or public hospital as a “medical home” for primary and preventive care. These providers are publicly funded, mostly through an employer mandate; you can say that the health care professionals at the providers are public employees.\n\nRelated: Failure to Pass the GOP Health Care Bill Could Doom Tax Reform This Year\n\nUsing medical homes, which can lower costs by ensuring early detection of problems before they get out of hand, as a baseline of universal coverage that can be topped off with a private system is similar to the way health care works in France.\n\nAnother idea would maintain a private health care industry while achieving most of the goals of single payer. That is known as all payer rate setting, and it’s what Martin O’Malley — remember him? — ran on in his presidential campaign. It got no traction, but the basic idea is that the government sets a distinct price for every medical procedure. Insurance companies no longer bargain with providers; they effectively band together to use their power to get the lowest possible rate.\n\nThis is actually how health care works in Maryland, in addition to Germany and Switzerland. Under O’Malley, Maryland instituted a global budget for hospitals, to reduce readmission rates and over-utilization of treatment as a way for health care providers to maximize profits. Insurance companies and hospitals actually like the certainty that comes with this system, despite the government intervention to set prices. It also attacks the tremendous billing waste in the system.\n\nPlus, the pharmaceutical supply chain, which features unnecessary profit-taking by middlemen at nearly every stage, needs a major overhaul. Trump has discussed “competitive bidding” in Medicare with the Congressional Black Caucus. That’s actually too narrow. The oligopolist drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers need to be broken up, and the markets made completely transparent on who pays what, or you’re not going to drive down costs for consumers.\n\nRelated: Pfizer Chief Says Government Efforts to Contain Drug Prices Will Backfire\n\nI didn’t mention lowering the Medicare eligibility age incrementally, or letting Americans buy into Medicare at cost, or even a public option to compete with private insurance. There are lots of ways to get to what a single payer system offers — a coherent market for health care that more affordably covers everyone than our current Rube Goldberg contraption. Standing on principles of true universal coverage is important and heartening. Whether it’s called single payer or just something that is consistent with those principles shouldn’t be a deal-breaker. But if Democrats think they can just talk up single payer to obtain power and then shuffle it off, they’re playing with fire."

    "text": "On Monday, the Trump administration will announce the launch of a new team within the White House dedicated to a massive overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, using ideas from the private sector to improve the efficiency of the government’s operations. The Washington Post, which broke the story, reported the White House Office of American Innovation will be run by President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president whose crowded portfolio also includes managing relations with China, negotiating Middle East peace, and more.\n\nThe administration sees the new office as a sort of “SWAT team” with broad license to restructure the federal bureaucracy, according to The Post. In a statement to the paper, the president said, “All Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays. I promised the American people I would produce results, and apply my ‘ahead of schedule, under budget’ mentality to the government.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Government Reorganization: Hatchet Job, or Just Major Surgery?\n\nThere is no question that if the new innovation office were to begin looking at federal agencies today, it would find extraordinary inefficiency, gridlock and paralysis. However, some of that is the fault of the new administration itself, which has fallen far behind in the task of appointing senior officials to the top ranks of federal agencies.\n\nAt the Justice Department, lawyers charged with enforcing existing criminal statutes have been told that in certain areas of law, previous guidance from the Obama administration is no longer operative. However, they complain that they can’t get clarity from the administration on new instructions and that, in many cases, they have nobody to ask.\n\nThe top ranks of the State Department are likewise notably empty of people who can credibly claim to speak for the new administration. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary James Mattis has on more than one occasion reportedly appeared in the offices of mid-level subject matter experts seeking to be briefed on topics that would normally be the responsibility of under-secretaries several steps down the organizational chart.\n\nThe Partnership for Public Service claims there are about 1,200 positions in the federal government that require a presidential appointee to be confirmed by the Senate. The Partnership calculates that 553 of those positions are “key” to having an executive branch that can function at a basic level.\n\nRelated: Campaign Issues Dominate, But Who’s Ready to Govern?\n\nAs of today, Trump has nominated 61 people to those key jobs, or about 11 percent of the openings. As a result of Senate Democrats’ resistance, the failure of nominees to make timely disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics, and the decisions of several nominees to withdraw from consideration, only 20 people have been confirmed.\n\nAt this stage, multiple executive branch departments have had no top-level political appointees named at all beyond the cabinet secretaries.\n\nAt the State Department, Secretary Rex Tillerson has no permanent deputy, assistant secretaries or undersecretaries. At Defense, Mattis is likewise without any top-level aides, though in his case some were finally nominated earlier this month. (On the downside, prospective secretaries of the Army and the Navy have both withdrawn as candidates.)\n\nThe story is the same at multiple other agencies. The Departments of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, Interior, all have no senior level nominees below the secretaries. The same is true at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nRelated: Why All the Ethical Problems of Trump’s Cabinet Nominees Won’t Matter\n\nAgencies where a handful of top posts have been filled, like the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury, are still facing long lists of key positions for which no nominees have been named, much less confirmed.\n\nTo be sure, no president in recent memory has staffed up an administration at a pace that can be described as “rapid.” Several, including the Obama administration, have had a handful of key positions still open almost a year into their terms. But the Trump administration is lagging far behind even its immediate predecessor in sending names to the Senate for confirmation.\n\nSenior figures in the administration, particularly White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, have trumpeted their plans to “deconstruct” much of the federal bureaucracy, and perhaps the apparent reluctance to fill top positions reflects a desire to slim the ranks of the top level federal workforce.\n\nBut it also means that when Kushner’s team parachutes into a federal agency looking for dysfunction and paralysis, one of its first orders of business will be trying to discern how much of it is of this administration’s own making."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Pfizer-Chief-Says-Government-Efforts-Contain-Drug-Prices-Will-Backfire",
    "text": "Pfizer Inc., the world’s largest drug manufacturer, is no stranger to the growing controversy over price gouging and anti-competitive practices that have drawn sharp criticism from President Trump and prompted calls for government intervention.\n\nLast December, for example, Pfizer and Flynn Pharma Ltd. were hit with record fines totaling more than $110 million in Great Britain after they were found to have conspired to increase prices by as much as 2,600 percent for unbranded versions of the anti-epilepsy drug Epanutin.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nThe stunning price increases were quietly imposed five years ago after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nFor a drug manufacturing behemoth like Pfizer with annual revenues of $52.8 billion, a hundred-million-dollar fine is little more than a rounding error and a small cost of doing business.\n\nIan C. Read, Pfizer’s hard-edged, Scottish-born CEO and chairman, has been unapologetic about his company’s dubious pricing practices. Last week, he gave no ground on the larger question about whether drug prices need to be reined in to protect consumers and taxpayers from rising prescription drug costs at Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Affairs Department.\n\nDuring a speech at the National Press Club, Read delivered an impassioned defense of the drug industry’s pricing practices, while denouncing any effort to impose government price controls as “a bad policy.”\n\nHe said that drug prices generally reflect the cost of research and innovation and their “value to society.” Without that research, he said, society would have been denied extraordinary medical breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, the hepatitis-C and HIV viruses and scores of other often deadly diseases.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nPresident Trump has criticized the drug industry for “getting away with murder” with its pricing practices and has floated a series of proposals, including speeding up the Food and Drug Administration’s review of new drug applications to enhance competition and contain price increases.\n\nTrump has also discussed a change in the law to allow Medicare officials to more aggressively negotiate drug prices and to permit the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\nHowever, Read and other drug industry executives have bridled at most of those suggestions and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has mounted a high-priced lobbying campaign to slap down any whiff of government imposed controls.\n\nRead argued that if the drug industry’s return on investment were higher, it might justify more aggressive government intervention to reduce drug prices. “But you must understand: Our focus is, What’s the value of the drug? Can we recover a portion of that value? And how much can the company extract in profits after negotiating with insurers, health care providers, and drug distribution middle-men?”\n\nRelated: Drug Prices Are Soaring: Here’s Why You May Not Get the Meds You Need\n\n“That’s how we price,” he said, adding later that “This industry needs a return that allows it to continue to do its research.”\n\nThe Deloitte Center for Health Solutions in the U.S. and the United Kingdom concluded in its latest analysis last year that the pharmaceutical industry “continues to face regulatory and reimbursement hurdles weighing on the research and development (R&D) returns of pharmaceutical firms.\n\nBased on a review of the estimated returns of 12 leading biopharma companies and comparing their performance with four mid-to-large-cap companies, the study found that annual projected PhRMA returns continued to decline to 3.7 percent, while the long-term costs related to bringing a product to market remained at roughly $1.5 billion.\n\nWhile he vigorously endorses President Trump’s call for a speed up in the Food and Drug Administration’s review of new drug applications, which often can take years to complete, Read was dismissive of any other government intervention in drug pricing.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices – but Can He Do It?\n\nHe argued, for instance, that drug importation would be very dangerous to patients. “It would really affect patients’ safety” since Canadian officials don’t regulate drugs being sent out of the country.” Read dismissed the “other stuff” being proposed by reformers as “a grain in the sand.”\n\n“Unless we get the incentives right, we won’t be able to fix health care,” he said. “I don’t believe that price controls of any part of the system” leads to innovation.\n\nRead made a similar argument during a speech earlier this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"One way of lowering health-care costs is to have more innovation and more competition,\" he said. “So pay more for medicine so we can develop more good medicine, so we can drive, through competition, lower costs.\"\n\nPfizer has never been shy about raising prices, even while other companies recently have begun to self-impose annual price increases of less than 10 percent in response to political pressure.\n\nLast June, for instance, Pfizer increased the list prices of its prescription drugs in the U.S. by an average of 8.8 percent, according to an investor note by Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger. In January of that year, Pfizer raised prices by an average of 10.4 percent."

    "text": "The Republicans suffered a humiliating defeat on their proposal to cut taxes for the wealthy disguised as healthcare reform. But as the Trump administration has made clear, they are not about to give up on their tax cut plans.\n\nBut how will those tax cuts be financed? The Republican’s health care reform plan would have delivered $600 billion in tax cuts, but with that option gone where will the money come from?\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nRepublicans would like you to believe that tax cuts can be financed by reducing government waste, cutting foreign aid, and so on, or from the miraculous economic growth tax cuts bring about. The reality is that these types of cuts won’t come anywhere close to covering budgetary cost of the tax cuts they have planned, and the hope that tax cuts will increase economic growth and hence tax revenue is undercut by the failure of tax cuts to stimulate economic growth during the Bush and Reagan administrations.\n\nThat will leave Republicans with two choices (assuming that health care reform is dead, as it appears to be). They can allow the national debt to expand substantially, by trillions if they make good on their tax cut promises, or they can cut entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. They could also give up on the tax cuts, but that’s not going to happen.\n\nBut as Republicans in Congress contemplate trying to finance tax cuts for the wealthy with cuts to programs such as Social Security, they should realize that many of the same market failures that made health care reform so difficult also plague social insurance programs more generally. There’s a reason why government got involved in these markets in the first place.\n\nConsider the individual mandate, a feature of Obamacare that Republicans have targeted for criticism. Social Security also has a mandate – if you report income to the government you have no choice but to pay Social Security taxes—and the program wouldn’t work without it.\n\nRelated: Blind Trust in Donald Trump Could Be Costly\n\nWhen people are left on their own to save for retirement, many people, despite the nagging feeling that they ought to be putting money away for the future, fail to do so. Immediate needs are more important. Taking care of family needs – just getting by each month – takes precedence over saving for the future.\n\nBut when people don’t save anything and arrive at old age penniless, society won’t let them be homeless and starve. Our social conscious will not allow that. However, the costs of giving people the basic necessities of life will be borne by society at large. Wouldn’t it be better if people were mandated to contribute to their retirement during their younger, working years? Even if their contributions don’t fully cover their retirement needs, isn’t it better if they cover at least some of the costs? That’s what the mandate does. It ensures that a fraction of every paycheck is put away for the future.\n\nSome people will save for retirement, but there are considerable uncertainties. Do I need to save enough to live into my 90’s, or will less savings be enough? This type of uncertainty seems to be easily overcome by insurance markets. People contribute to a retirement fund, and those who are unlucky and have lifespans that are shorter than average fund those who are lucky enough to live longer. Smoothing these kinds of risks (in this case against running out of money in old age) is what insurance markets are supposed to do.\n\nHere’s the problem. Retirement insurance is a bad deal for people who have family histories or other reasons to believe that will not realize a typical lifespan (the average lifespan determines insurance premiums they would pay). If a large number of people who do not expect to realize an average lifespan drop out choosing instead to save on their own – they don’t think they will need to save as much as insurance asks them to pay – premiums will have to rise since the insurance pool will be made up of people who are likely to live longer than average.\n\nRelated: When It Comes to Trumponomics, Economists Are on High Alert\n\nBut as premiums rise, more people conclude it’s a bad deal and drop out, premiums rise again causing even more people to drop out, and as this continues the market will eventually collapse leaving people no choice but to save for retirement on their own. But, for the reasons given above, leaving people to save for retirement on their own doesn’t work. The only way to solve this problem is a mandate for everyone to contribute to a retirement fund, and that requires government to intervene in these markets.\n\nAs Republicans try to find a way to implement their tax cut plans without exploding the national debt, they will face the same problem they faced with health care. The only way to fund the tax cuts is to cut programs millions of people depend upon, programs that only government can provide. Cutting either Social Security or Medicare would have severe political repercussions.\n\nLarge tax cuts for the wealthy without a significantly increasing the debt is an impossible task."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/27/Can-Trump-and-Dems-Find-Common-Ground-Health-Care",
    "text": "President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) now acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act will remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future, following last week’s debacle in which they were forced to pull the Republicans’ repeal and replacement plan before it was put to a vote in the House.\n\nThey argued for months that Obamacare was in a “death spiral” and would eventually collapse of its own weight, but that alone wasn’t a compelling enough argument to rally Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate behind the Republican’s alternative approach. Moreover, analyses by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showed that Obamacare wasn’t in dire financial straits and that 24 million Americans would lose health care coverage by 2026, including 14 million by choice.\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nNow, in the wake of last Friday’s GOP legislative train wreck, the Trump Administration and Republican congressional leaders are facing a critical choice: Should they continue to pursue a destructive and seemingly vindictive course to further undermine Obamacare in hopes of fulfilling their gloomy prophecy? Or should they join with Democrats and more moderate Republicans in seeking ways to fix the worst problems of a program that has insured more than 20 million Americans?\n\nOver the weekend, the Trump camp and some congressional Democrats signaled that some sort of political rapprochement over health care was not out of the realm of possibility after months of bitter conflict in which the Democrats stood united against any GOP plan. All sides agree that something needs to be done to strengthen the financial position of insurers, beef up competition, and slow the rate of growth of premiums and out of pocket costs. But if history is any indication of what to expect, the chances of a bipartisan agreement to strengthen the existing program seem unlikely at best.\n\nDuring their separate press conferences Friday to try to explain why they failed to pass the GOP American Health Care Act, Trump and Ryan both seemed to be rooting for Obamacare to fail, notwithstanding the adverse effect that would have on millions of Americans who receive subsidized private insurance or expanded Medicaid through the program.\n\n“I hope it does well; I would love it to do well. But it can’t do well; it’s imploding and soon will explode, and it’s not going to be pretty,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump voiced interest in working with Democrats, but only after they came to the realization that Obamacare was a failure. Ryan told reporters at the Capitol that Obamacare is “so fundamentally flawed” that he didn’t know whether it was even possible to prop it up.\n\nOn Sunday, however, the administration and congressional Democrats signaled that there might be room for bipartisanship to address some of Obamacare’s more glaring problems. The growing exodus of major insurers like Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Cross-Blue Shield from the Obamacare market has many policymakers in both parties spooked.\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC News’This Week that he could foresee room for negotiations going forward, provided Trump and the Republicans abandon their crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “They ought to get rid of repeal – drop it – it’s been a flop for them . . . and work with us to improve Obamacare,” Schumer said.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus continued to insist that Obamacare is fundamentally flawed and “is going south,” during an appearance on Fox New Sunday. But he wouldn’t rule out the possibility of a cooperative effort later this year to prop up the existing program, and said it was important that the Democrats ultimately “come to the table.”\n\n“I want people out there to understand this president is not going to be a partisan president,” Priebus said. “This is a president that wants to make sure people don’t get left behind; he wants to make sure there is competition in the marketplace so that rates are lower and people can choose their doctors.”\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\n“So if those three things are incompatible with some members of the Republican House, then we need to work with moderate Democrats to make sure that that happens,” he added.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said that a more cooperative effort is not out of the question if both sides find a way to tone down their partisanship and accept the fact that Obamacare is here to stay. “Absolutely, there are a lot of fixes that could and should be made,” he said.\n\nBut that would be a tall order politically and begs the question of how the White House and Democrats could strike a compromise on health care over the almost certain objections of members of the House Freedom Caucus and other conservatives who are still clamoring for the complete repeal of Obamacare.\n\nIf the past is prologue then the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress will probably double down in trying to crush Obamacare with many techniques that already have been road-tested by the Republicans over the past several years and since Trump took office Jan. 20.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nThose tactics include reducing advertising and recruitment activities, weakening the enforcement of the ACA’s “individual mandate” requiring people to obtain coverage, cutting federal spending to underwrite unforeseen losses by insurers, and sharing in the out-of-pocket costs of low-income policyholders.\n\nObamacare managed to survive two major court challenges that reached the Supreme Court and scores of Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to defund and dismantle the program over the years. Yet, GOP lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida were instrumental in the closing of many of the 23 non-profit insurance plans under the ACA in 2015 and 2016 by blocking federal assistance to many of the coops that had incurred heavy operating losses.\n\nHouse Republicans also went to court to block Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies for lower-and-middle-income people arguing they were unlawful because they hadn’t been specifically authorized by Congress. The Obama administration challenged an adverse federal court ruling in May 2016 that has put the subsidies on hold, but the new Trump administration might allow House Republicans to prevail in killing the subsidies.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nShortly after taking office in late January, Trump signed an executive order designed to undercut the Affordable Care Act by instructing the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies responsible for administering the program to find ways to ease the burden of the law on individuals and businesses. The Internal Revenue Service responded in early February by weakening the health care law’s requirement that individuals either acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the government.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, the White House and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price – an arch foe of Obamacare -- will be faced with a number of choices over “whether to shore up insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act – or let them atrophy,” The Washington Post reported over the weekend.\n\nFor 2917, the federal exchanges signed up or auto-renewed 9.2 million Americans, down by about 400,000 people from the previous year. That dip was due in part to the Trump administration’s decision to curtail recruitment efforts in the final week of the enrollment season. Overall, an estimated 12 million people have enrolled in both federal and state-operated insurance markets this year, which typically drops when the first premium payment is due.\n\nInsurers and consumers are operating in an environment of uncertainty over the future of Obamacare, especially if Trump and Ryan take further measures to drive the program into the ground. That uncertainty could lead to another round of rising premium costs and diminished competition and policy choices heading into the 2018 insurance season.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn’t Control the Final Episode\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Post, “The administration could do everything from actively undermining the law to trying to reshape it to moving it in a more conservative direction.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/26/Chair-Freedom-Caucus-Open-Deficit-Expanding-Tax-Cuts",
    "text": "The House Freedom Caucus was so successful in opposing a version of the American Health Care Act that one of the bill’s authors declared it “dead” and the White House signaled that it planned to walk away from the issue entirely. Oddly, though, HFC chairman Mark Meadows of North Carolina appeared on ABC Sunday morning and spoke about the bill as though its fate were still being debated.\n\nCongress, he insisted, is still in the “negotiation process” and “this is not the end of the debate.”\n\nRelated: 4 Political Minefields Waiting for Trump Following His Health Care Failure\n\nUsing a somewhat convoluted analogy to a football game, Meadows suggested that declaring the AHCA dead after House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Trump were forced to pull it from the floor on Friday was like declaring a game over at halftime.\n\n“We may be in overtime,” he said. “At the end of the day, the most valuable player will be president Trump on this.”\n\nMeadows added, “I still believe there is a good chance if moderates and conservatives can come together that we repeal and replace Obamacare, bring premiums down, cover more people.”\n\nIt was unclear why Meadows seemed so intent on assuring host George Stephanopoulos that the health care bill is still in play on Capitol Hill after his caucus successfully undermined it within the GOP. But one possibility is that Meadows and other members of the Freedom Caucus are taking seriously Trump’s threat on Friday to begin working with Democrats and less doctrinaire Republicans on an alternative effort to reform the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nThe strength of the Freedom Caucus lies in its ability to block the Republican House majority from passing bills on party-line votes if its members deem them insufficiently conservative. But in a world where the Republican majority makes common cause with a significant number of moderate Democrats on compromise legislation that gives both groups some of what they want, the Freedom Caucus would be effectively marginalized.\n\nTo be sure, there is no obvious path to bipartisanship in a Congress that is as ideologically divided as it has ever been. But Trump’s professed willingness to work with Democrats, and the fact that he really seems to hold few firm conservative principles, might be making Meadows and some of his caucus members nervous.\n\nIn fact, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus suggested that was exactly the point of Trump’s talk of bipartisanship.\n\n“I think it’s more or less a warning shot that we’re ready to talk to anyone, that we always have been, and I think more so now than ever it’s time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country, whether it be taxes; whether it be health care; whether it be immigration; whether it be infrastructure. This president is ready to lead.”\n\nRelated: Why the Senate Would Be an Even Higher Hurdle for the GOP Health Plan\n\nPriebus hammered the message home on Sunday morning, telling host Chris Wallace multiple times that the White House is interested in working with moderate Democrats.\n\nMuch of the criticism of the Freedom Caucus, especially from their fellow Republicans frustrated with the obstruction of the AHCA, focused on what many described as an unwillingness to “take ‘yes’ for an answer.” The group wrung major concessions out of House leaders and the White House, but because they didn’t get everything they wanted, they refused to go along with the bill in the end.\n\nOn Sunday, Meadows seemed to signal that the ideological rigidity of the Freedom Caucus may not be such an impediment to other Trump priorities, such as reform of the tax code.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Freedom Caucus is its members' insistence that they are “fiscal conservatives.” To most people, fiscal conservatism typically means opposition to deficit spending and a determination to reduce the national debt. Indeed, the Freedom Caucus has typically been one of the toughest nuts for Republican leaders to crack when it comes to raising the debt ceiling.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes His Brash, Bare-Knuckle Negotiating Style to Capitol Hill\n\nMeadows said that he expects his members will “help” the president on tax reform and that when it comes to funding the government, “there’s not going to be an issue there.”\n\nSurprisingly, Meadows said that he personally would be open to reform that cuts taxes for Americans but doesn’t include offsetting cuts in spending or increases in revenue designed to prevent the deficit and debt from rising.\n\n“Does it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no,” Meadows said.\n\nHe suggested that feeling may be less rare within the Freedom Caucus than many expect. “I think there’s been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset and that’s a move that we’re trying to do to provide real relief and economic growth.”\n\nThat would again pit Meadows against Ryan, who typically insists that tax reform packages be at least revenue neutral, but the show of flexibility might be more welcome to Trump, who frequently appears to be more concerned with being perceived as a “winner” than he does with ideological or policy purity."

    "text": "Hours before President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan were forced to throw in the towel and withdraw their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was telling a Washington audience that overhauling the federal tax code will be a lot easier than trying to rewrite federal health care law.\n\n“Health care and tax reforms are two very different things,” Mnuchin told a breakfast gathering sponsored by Axios. “Health care is a very, very complicated issue. In a way [changes in the tax code are] a lot simpler.”\n\nRelated: In Defeat, Trump and Ryan Offer No Path Forward on Health Care\n\nTrump and his advisers sought to gloss over the significance of the president’s historic setback, largely at the hands of an unintended coalition arch-conservative and unyielding House Freedom Caucus members who thought the bill didn’t go far enough in dismantling the ACA and more moderate Republicans concerned the bill was going too far.\n\nStriking a philosophical pose, Trump blamed the Democrats for his failure and declared it was time to put health care reform behind him and move on to challenges more to his liking, such as overhauling the tax system and trade policy. “It’s enough already,” Trump said.\n\nOutside observers were less charitable.\n\n“It’s a debacle,” said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. “For a president whose party controls both houses of Congress to lose on the first big bill of his term is staggering.”\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nThe administration may well be misreading the political landscape again if Trump and Pence think they can shrug off this defeat and move ahead with the rest of their ambitious political agenda.\n\nJohn Zogby, a veteran pollster and political analyst, described the defeat of the Republican health plan as “a breathtaking and multiple-level loss” with serious implications for the administration’s ability to advance other legislative priorities.\n\nAnd the problem isn’t just between the White House and Capitol Hill. Some political analysts say that the collapse of the Republicans’ American Health Care Act was emblematic of a glaring ideological cleavage within the House Republican caucus and between House and Senate Republicans more generally that will make future deal-making equally challenging.\n\nIn fact, the failure of the GOP health care plan could signal trouble ahead on a whole range of fiscal issues, from Trump’s and Ryan’s effort to rewrite the tax code for the first time since 1986 to passing new spending plans for this year and next and raising the debt ceiling by early fall to avert a first-ever default on U.S. debt.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nHere are just four of Trump’s biggest fiscal challenges:\n\nTax Reform. Mnuchin’s optimism aside, there is literally nothing easy about rewriting the tax code. It hasn’t been done since 1986, and that’s because once a serious effort to do so begins, the army of special interest groups and lobbyists that will assemble to protect cherished tax breaks and angle for other special treatment will make the battle to repeal the ACA look like a minor skirmish.\n\nTrump has done himself no favors here, with his repeated promise to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries whose trade policies he doesn’t like. Nor has Ryan, by floating the idea of a Border Adjustable tax that would effectively favor some U.S. businesses over others, depending on whether they import things like raw materials or inventory. Both proposals have preemptively agitated constituencies who they will need to partner with on any tax reform effort.\n\nThere’s also the problem of basic math. Trump and Ryan are very interested in cutting taxes, but are far less clear about how -- and from whom -- the lost revenue would be made up.\n\nThe last president who managed to shepherd tax reform through Congress was Ronald Reagan, and he began the effort fresh off a landslide reelection victory and after four years of building relationships with Congressional leader. Trump is a few months off an election in which he lost the popular vote. And despite his habit of touting his shrewd negotiating skills, Trump appeared at times inept and clueless in dealing with just his own party as he attempted to broker a deal on health care reform.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nSpending Controversies. Trump is pushing for a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year, much of it coming at the expense of scores of government agencies and programs. He’s also promising to find a way to create a $1 trillion infrastructure program fueled by tax breaks. And he wants to do all this while passing tax cuts.\n\nTrump may have got his first lesson in Congressional assertiveness in the defeat of his health care bill, but when he submits a detailed new budget, fleshing out the “skinny” budget released last week, he’s likely to get another.\n\nSenior members of Congress -- including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- already are bridling at his initial budget proposal calling for steep cuts in many departments and agencies, including EPA, State Department/USAID and NIH.\n\nAs those cuts start to look more real, and translate into the expectation of the loss of solid government jobs in Congressional districts across the country as well as cuts in federal services, the Trump administration will have another very difficult sales job on its hands.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn’t Control the Final Episode\n\nThe Border Wall. Even more than his vow to repeal Obamacare, Trump campaigned on the promise to erect a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep out undocumented immigrants. Now, with that project facing a sticker price that could top $25 billion, Trump is going to have to find a way to shoehorn that appropriation into Congressional spending bills as well.\n\nAnd while the wall plays very well in some places far from the actual border, it is surprisingly unpopular among many people who actually live near where the proposed barrier would be installed. That price tag is going to look a lot more forbidding when people point out that it could fund other things -- like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or the State Department’s public diplomacy efforts -- for decades.\n\nThe Debt Ceiling. This is the big one. The clock is already ticking on the next legislative push to increase the Treasury’s borrowing limit, ensuring the country does not go into default. The agency is actually up against it already, but its well-worn arsenal of “extraordinary” measures will give Congress until the fall to act.\n\nThe reason this is a particularly dicey situation for Trump is that his main adversaries within the Republican conference are going to be the same people emboldened by their ability to derail his health care bill: the House Freedom Caucus and their allies in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Trump Prepares His Health Care Plan B\n\nThe debt ceiling is a bête noire of the most conservative members of Congress, many of whom expressed a willingness to let the country default rather than increase the level of the Treasury’s debt. Now secure in the knowledge that they were able to face down Trump on the issue of health care, they may well be emboldened to buck the president and Congressional leadership even more aggressively.\n\nRyan recently raised the possibility that the tax-cut package would also be used as the vehicle for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a first-ever default on the U.S. debt this fall. Tying two such fraught pieces of legislation together would likely exponentially increase the leverage of the Freedom Caucus to demand changes to their liking.\n\nAll this adds up to a very difficult road forward for Trump and Ryan, particularly when it comes to legislation vital to the country’s fiscal health. They had been counting on momentum from a successful repeal of Obamacare to drive their agenda forward, but now that the GOP health care bill has gone down to defeat -- despite Republican majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican president -- their ability to find their way is in question.\n\nAnd Trump himself, with his ever-changing explanations of what’s happening, isn’t inspiring confidence.\n\n“Just in the last 24 hours he has said that tax cuts and reform will be near impossible without repeal of Obamacare and now he is saying he should have begun with taxes,” Zogby said in an email on Friday. “At some point he is going to have to win something. His very angry base may feel good that he is breaking the rules and talking trash against opponents and the media – but he is going to have to put points on the board at some point.”"

    "text": "As it became clear that the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was bound to fail in the House of Representatives on Friday, the crucial question became: What comes next? About half an hour after his office announced that the scheduled vote on the American Health Care Act had been cancelled, House Speaker Paul Ryan gave his answer: Nothing.\n\nIn the end, there really was no Plan B. After Ryan and President Trump decided Friday afternoon to take the embarrassing step of pulling the bill from the floor rather than risk what was shaping up to be an even more embarrassing defeat as the list of Republican “No” votes grew longer and longer, Ryan offered no path forward.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn’t Control the Final Episode\n\n“We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,” Ryan admitted in a press conference at the Capitol. He insisted that the House Republicans had come very close to passing the replacement legislation, but were unable to overcome solid Democratic resistance combined with defections from both the right wing of their own party and from more moderate members who were against concessions made in an effort to appease the right wing.\n\nRyan characterized the conflict within the party as “growing pains” that members who have spent 10 years in the opposition are experiencing as they transition to governing.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Ryan if he would change his focus from attempting to completely eliminate the ACA to working with Democrats to try to improve the bill, he suggested that any effort to do so would be pointless because, he said, the bill is too “fundamentally flawed” to fix. He repeated his assertion that the system is in a “death spiral” -- a claim that is disputed by the Congressional Budget Office, which believes health insurance markets will be mostly stable under the existing law.\n\nIn a statement from the Oval Office, President Trump also suggested that the next step for Republicans would be to turn to other priorities such as tax reform, and to simply wait for what he described as the inevitable collapse of the health insurance system. However, he went a step further than Ryan, expressing a willingness to work with Democrats on a bipartisan effort to craft new health care legislation.\n\nRelated: Why the Senate Would Be an Even Higher Hurdle for the GOP Health Plan\n\n“The best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,” Trump said. “It is exploding right now ... It’s going to have a very bad year.”\n\nHe added, “What would be really good, if the Democrats, when it explodes, they got together with us and got a real health care bill.” Referring to the Democrats, he said “when they all get civilized and get together,” Republicans will be “open to it.”\n\nTrump also insisted that the bill had been within a few votes of passage and appeared to blame Democrats for failing to offer any support. He did not explain why a bill crafted with no input from Democrats and aimed at gutting the last Democratic president’s signature domestic achievement ought to have attracted that party’s support.\n\nRepublicans streaming out of a conference meeting shortly before Ryan spoke appeared angry and defeated. They also appeared no more sure of a way forward than their leaders.\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\n“The bill is dead,” said Rep. Greg Walden, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which had voted to approve the original version of the AHCA.\n\nAsked what members would do now, Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania said simply, “We go home.”"

    "text": "The public is generally supportive of President Trump’s ambitions to build up the military, beginning with a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year. By a margin of 58 to 39 percent, voters say that increased military spending is a \"good idea,\" according to a new Quinnipiac University poll released on Friday.\n\nBut voters strongly disagree with the way Trump is seeking to finance that buildup – with deep, offsetting cuts in practically every government department, agency and program, the poll found. They are especially troubled by the proposed deep cuts in funding for medical research, new roads and transportation, climate change research and the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\n\"It's a rousing yes for healing the vets and growing the military,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement. “But when it comes to cutting Public TV, the arts, after school programs and scientific research to improve the environment, it's a stern 'hands off' from voters.”\n\nWhat’s more, nearly two thirds of those surveyed think starting to fund Trump’s plan to build a nearly 2,000-mile long wall along the southern border with Mexico to make good on one of his principal campaign promises is a “bad idea.”\n\nTrump’s March 16 “America First” budget proposal calls on Congress to make the first down payments on the cost of building the wall to crack down on illegal border crossings into this country. That would begin with a relatively modest $1.5 billion appropriation this year and more than $2 billion next year -- a small fraction of the estimated $25 billion overall cost that Trump once said would be paid by the Mexican government.\n\nThe poll found 64 percent of voters interviewed said they thought it was a bad idea while 35 percent support Trump’s effort. The backing is far more intense among Republicans, who say by a margin of 74 percent to 24 percent that the wall should be funded.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nTrump’s 53-page spending blueprint for fiscal 2018 calls for sharp increases in defense, homeland security and veterans’ health. The Department of Defense would receive a 10 percent increase in its budget, the Department of Homeland Security would see its budget rise by 6.8 percent and the Veteran Affairs Department would get a 6 percent increase.\n\nIn contrast, most other government agencies and programs were targeted for cuts. And agencies and departments that came in for tough criticism from Trump during the campaign were hardest hit.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency were hit by the steepest cut of 31 percent, followed by the State Department/USAID with a 29 percent cut and the Department of Agriculture with a 21 percent reduction. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation’s premier scientific research program that provides grants for research in the U.S. and overseas, would be cut by 20 percent.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nBut when asked what they thought of many of the proposed cuts, here were the voters’ responses:\n\n* 87% to 9% against cutting funding for medical research.\n\n*84% to 13% against cutting funding for new road and transit projects.\n\n*67% to 31% against cuts to scientific research on the environment and climate change.\n\n*83% to 14% against cutting funding for after school and summer school programs.\n\n*66% to 27% against eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n*79% to 17% against eliminating the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\nTrump’s spending plan for the coming fiscal year is focused almost exclusively on the third of the roughly $4 trillion annual federal budget that goes for discretionary programs and general government operations and is far from the final word. House and Senate Republican and Democratic leaders stressed that Trump’s draconian spending plan was merely an opening gambit.\n\nCongress holds the government’s purse strings, those leaders noted, and lawmakers will have the final say."

    "text": "President Trump is facing a do-or-die vote in the House Friday afternoon in an improbable bid to win passage of a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in the face of strong resistance from the conservative Freedom Caucus and more moderate Republicans.\n\nYet, even if Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) were to pull out a victory with the American Health Care Act, the controversial measure brimming with last-minute side deals to sweeten the pot would face an even tougher challenge in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Trump Prepares His Plan B If Health Care Reform Fails\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has promised swift action on the plan if it reaches the upper chamber. McConnell is eager to resolve the health care battle as soon as possible to make way for the debate and vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch before a spring recess. But as many as a dozen or more Republican senators – both hard-edged conservatives and moderates – have either come out against the House GOP plan or are leaning heavily against it.\n\nThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, with the Democrats united in opposition to the plan. That means that McConnell can afford to lose no more than two Republican senators and still pass the bill, assuming that Vice President Mike Pence, the presiding officer, casts the tie-breaking vote to approve the plan. By contrast, House Republicans could afford to suffer 22 defections and still prevail in the floor vote.\n\nThe ever-evolving House GOP plan would repeal most of the Obamacare mandates, taxes and subsidies and replace them with a new approach, including a system of refundable tax credits tied to beneficiaries’ age. The plan would also freeze and roll back expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor under the Affordable Care Act and would overhaul how states funnel Medicaid funding to the states.\n\nIn an effort to gain additional support from conservatives, House leaders have proposed a number of late-inning amendments, including a work requirement for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid and a measure repealing Obamacare’s requirement that insurers cover 10 “essential” medical services.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn’t Control the Final Episode\n\nBut the plan has come under withering fire in the Senate from all sides.\n\nStaunch conservatives -- including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas -- don’t think the plan goes far enough in rapidly repealing Obamacare mandates and taxes. Paul has dismissed it as “Obamacare Lite.”\n\nMeanwhile, moderates -- including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio -- worry that the bill will ultimately strip tens of millions of Americans of their health insurance under Obamacare and expanded Medicaid and that premiums will end up being much higher than the House Republicans promised.\n\n“This is not a bill I could support in its current form,” Collins told the Portland Press Herald this week. “It really misses the mark.”\n\nThe latest analysis of the plan by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office warns that as many as 24 million Americans would be without health care coverage by 2026 if the repeal and replacement plan became law. The analysis released on Thursday also reaffirms an earlier finding that premiums on average would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019 under the plan, before beginning to drop.\n\nHowever, the report provides an incomplete picture because the CBO didn’t have time to include a number of last-minute deals struck by Trump and Ryan to try to win passage in the House, including some that might further reduce the number of Americans with coverage down the road or add to the overall cost of the program.\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\nAccording to Politico, senior Senate Republicans are dubious that the House GOP plan could survive a test in the Senate – both because of the strong opposition within the party and parliamentary landmines that could blow up in the Republicans’ face during the floor debate.\n\nRepublican senators have largely watched from afar as House Republicans engaged in internecine warfare over the health care replacement plan, while more quietly debating an issue with profound political implications heading into the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nSenators from both sides of the aisle have complained that Ryan and Trump have been hasty in pushing for swift passage of a bill, with little understanding about the long-term effects it might have on the health care system. “It’s more important to finally get health-care reform right than to get it fast,” Cotton has said repeatedly.\n\nRelated: Costs, Coverage of Latest Health Bill Revision a Mystery as Vote Looms\n\nUnlike in the House, where the leadership can pretty much dictate the rules to be followed in debating legislation, the Senate is encumbered by scores of long-standing rules that can ensnare controversial legislation and open the flood gates to challenges.\n\nRepublican leaders chose a fiscal 2017 budget resolution as the principal vehicle for passing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare because it would enable them to invoke special “reconciliation” provisions in the Senate to circumvent a Democratic filibuster and pass the legislation with a simple majority. Without reconciliation, Republican leaders would have to amass a 60-vote super majority to pass the major legislation – an impossible task with the Democrats united against it.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Act of 1974 permits the use of reconciliation for budgetary and fiscal measures that impact the size of the deficit or surplus, as in the case of major tax bills or long-term budget agreements. However, the so-called “Byrd Rule,” authored by the late West Virginia Democratic senator Robert Byrd, allows senators to object to elements of the legislation that either significantly increase the deficit over a ten-year period or are “extraneous matters.”\n\nThose extraneous matters can include such things as measures that do not result in a change in spending or revenues that only incidentally impact outlays and revenues or that are deemed outside the jurisdiction of the budget committees. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other Democrats have vowed to invoke the Byrd Rule to challenge some of the last-minute add-ons to the House bill that were aimed at placating conservatives.\n\nA likely prime target for the Democrats would be the amendment negotiated by President Trump that would end the insurance mandates in the Affordable Care Act that require that requires health care plans sold to individuals cover 10 essential services, including maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment, prescription drugs and preventative care.\n\nOther likely targets for challenge include a proposed ban on federal funding for Planned Parenthood and a work requirement for many able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid coverage for the poor. If the Senate parliamentarian rules in the favor of the Democrats on any of these challenges, the Republicans would have to muster at least 60 votes to override the ruling – an impossible feat given the stark partisan divide in the chamber."

    "text": "The fate of the American Health Care Act in the House of Representatives remained unresolved on Friday morning, and it was becoming increasingly apparent that President Trump and his administration are preparing two different kinds of responses, depending on the final result. One will involve Trump taking credit for dramatically “closing the deal” with House conservatives. The alternative will find House Speaker Paul Ryan under the wheels of the metaphorical bus.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump, the self-proclaimed master negotiator, sent his budget director to Capitol Hill to announce that the president was finished negotiating with members of the House Freedom Caucus, the bill’s primary opponents within the GOP, and demanded a vote. If the bill doesn’t pass, he informed them, the president would move on to other priorities and leave them to explain to their constituents that they had failed to follow through on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s New Health Care Reality Show, He Doesn’t Control the Final Episode\n\nSome in the White House, late Thursday and even early Friday, were still professing optimism that enough Republicans would eventually rally to the president to pass the bill over united Democratic opposition. If that happens, it’s plain that Trump and his surrogates will claim it as proof that his supposed prowess at negotiating in the private sector has carried over into the public sector. Indeed, even the bill’s chief opponent, Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, has praised Trump for going to great lengths to engage lawmakers on the details of the bill.\n\nBut privately and in anonymous comments to the press, the administration is plainly also preparing a strategy to deflect blame if the bill fails. And Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who has been pushing AHCA in the House, is their primary target.\n\nIn a brief press appearance this morning, Trump was noncommittal about the bill’s chances, saying “We’ll see,” when asked if he thought it would pass, and saying that he didn’t believe the AHCA had been brought to the floor too soon. Asked if he thought Ryan should resign if the legislation fails, he said no.\n\nHowever, at almost the same time, anonymous White House officials were telling reporters that if the bill goes down to defeat, the fault would be Ryan’s. One told CNN that the battle over the bill was “not Ryan’s finest hour.”\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\nLate Thursday, The New York Times published a piece citing four White House sources who claim that Trump now blames Ryan for convincing him to support the plan to take on Obamacare as the the House’s first order of business in the new president’s term. He supposedly now wishes that he had focused his initial efforts instead on tax reform or creating a plan for new infrastructure spending.\n\nOn Friday morning, New York Magazine published a story claiming that Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, dislikes the bill Ryan brought to the floor, complaining that it was “written by the insurance industry” and that it fails to undo enough of the regulations surrounding the provision of health insurance.\n\nBannon’s former website, Breitbart News, which is seen as extremely friendly to Trump and is widely read by the far right, seized on the comments with a headline trumpeting “Bannon Pans Ryan Bill.”\n\nIn truth, the effort to lay the blame for the bill on Ryan has been going on since before Trump delivered his Thursday ultimatum. Last week Chris Ruddy, the publisher of Newsmax and a close friend of Trump, blasted the bill in interviews and articles for more than a week.\n\nRelated: Costs, Coverage of Latest Health Bill Revision a Mystery as Vote Looms\n\n“I think Paul Ryan did a major disservice to President Trump, I think the president was extremely courageous in taking on health care and trusted others to come through with a program he could sign off on,” he told Bloomberg last week. “The President had confidence Paul Ryan would come up with a good plan and to me, it is disappointing.”\n\nTo longtime observers of Washington, the rush by the White House to set the stage for a “Blame Ryan” campaign seemed oddly counterproductive with the fate of the bill still in doubt.\n\n“Maybe they're trying to pressure @SpeakerRyan & House to deliver,” tweeted David Axelrod, former senior adviser to President Obama, “but these precriminations from WH seem ill-timed.”"

He learned those skills on the Hill as Robert Caro richly details in the third volume of his award-winning LBJ biography, Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate.\n\nAs Caro’s website says, Johnson “manipulated the Senate’s hallowed rules and customs and the weaknesses and strengths of his colleagues to change the ‘unchangeable’ Senate from a loose confederation of sovereign senators to a whirring legislative machine under his own iron-fisted control.”\n\nTrump is not a creature of Washington and probably never will be. He trained at the right hand of his father, New York developer Fred Trump, and wound up sparring for decades in the Gleason’s Gym of bare-knuckle, in-your-face negotiating: the Manhattan real estate market.\n\nRelated: Like LBJ, Trump Is Loving the Role of America’s Dealmaker\n\nTrump’s best-seller The Art of the Deal may have been mostly dreamed up and written by co-author Tony Schwartz, but the President’s whole brash, loose-with-the-truth, promise-‘em-anything persona was forged in a cutthroat world where raising a middle finger and walking away from the table is not just a threat.\n\nThe President’s trip to the Hill this week and subsequent meeting with holdouts from the House’s Freedom Caucus may not lead to the repeal and replacement of Obamacare that he endlessly promised his supporters on the campaign trail.\n\nBy rolling the dice and demanding a vote on what looks like a seriously flawed health care bill even though there was no assurance of passage, Trump did demonstrate to Washington politicians -- and especially Tea Party-type ideologues -- that they are looking at four years of dealing with a leader in the White House whose only philosophy is winning. And if it means abandoning a key component of his rise to power, he can live with that.\n\nAs New Yorkers like to say, “F--- ‘em if they can’t deal with it.”"

    "text": "As Washington fiddles, China is investing billions in U.S. startups with cutting-edge products that could have military applications at the same time it is dialing back investments in less critical American industries such as entertainment.\n\nA New York Times story this week says that among the startups are companies working on artificial intelligence for military robots, rocket engines, ship sensors and printers that could produce high-tech components such as computer screens for military jets. Many of the firms making such investments are owned by companies controlled by the Chinese government or connected to its leaders.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Scientists Worry the US Is Losing the Artificial Intelligence Arms Race\n\nA blog post last December on the website of CB Insights, which tracks startup investments, says that China poured $9.9 billion into new Silicon Valley firms in 2015 and made an additional $3.5 billion in tech investments in the first nine months of last year. The number and size of those tech investments in startups developing military applications were not broken out.\n\nThe Times story says a Defense Department white paper being circulated among Trump administration officials makes the case that “Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China’s military capacity as well as its economy.” A call to the Defense Department for comment was referred to a public affairs officer who was not immediately available.\n\nLast year, China spent $225 billion investing in or buying out overseas companies, although there is evidence that the leadership in Beijing is exerting pressure to both rein in outflows of capital and ensure that when investments are made, they are in strategic industries.\n\nRelated: China Will Own New Year’s Eve in Times Square\n\nFor example, one casualty of more controlled investment may have been the $1 billion deal by Dalian Wanda Group to buy Dick Clark Productions, which produces a popular New Year’s Eve countdown show and the Golden Globe Awards ceremony, among other entertainment properties.\n\nEldridge Industries, which owns Dick Clark Productions, moved to terminate the deal earlier this month after contending that Wanda, which has been aggressively pursuing investments in Hollywood, was unwilling to meet its obligations. Earlier this week, the New York Post reported that a $1 billion financing deal between Viacom’s Paramount Pictures and two Chinese companies, Shanghai Film Group and Hua Hua Media, is in jeopardy.\n\nWhat is driving the Chinese interest in U.S. startups focused on AI and robotics with military applications seems to be a recognition that the parameters of war and defense are rapidly evolving.\n\nA report prepared last October for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Committee, which monitors the national security implications of trade and deals with China, said that “Chinese military leaders and strategists believe that the nature of warfare is fundamentally changing due to unmanned platforms” and pointed to a growing military drone industry and efforts to acquire artificial intelligence capabilities either by investment or possibly “cyber espionage.\n\nRelated: Game of Drones: The Air Force Ramps Up Video Game Warfare\n\nThe study conducted by the intelligence research and analysis firm Defense Group Inc. said: “Chinese strategists consider the U.S. military to be increasingly dependent upon unmanned systems, making countermeasures against these weapons a necessity.”\n\nBesides attempting to acquire military technology illegally or through means that are not clearly regulated, DGI said “state-owned conglomerates, companies, and venture capital firms are actively acquiring and investing in AI and foreign robotics technologies companies, particularly in Europe.”\n\nThe report recommended that Washington “monitor and when necessary investigate China’s growing foreign investments in robotics and AI companies and consider the security implications of transactions and acquisitions involving emerging technologies such as AI and nanorobotics.”\n\nInvestigating Chinese investments, however, may not address the root problem. Some startups told the Times that they turned to Chinese investors because they were more willing to take risks and because the American military has been reluctant to take a chance on unproven technology even when the capital required is relatively insignificant."

    "text": "Like the penultimate episode of a television reality show, the debate over the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Thursday was marked by conflict, confusion, and finally, a grand ultimatum from Donald Trump. The president demanded a final vote on the measure in the House of Representatives and vowed to walk away from the GOP’s American Health Care Act if the vote fails, leaving Obamacare in place.\n\nTrump’s move set up Friday as the final episode in the drama that has consumed much of the first weeks of his presidency. But unlike”The Apprentice,” the television program that defined his public persona throughout the decade before he entered politics, it’s not Trump who will have the final say over who comes away a winner today.\n\nRelated: Trump and GOP Flailing as Obamacare Repeal Stumbles\n\nAs of early Friday morning, the House Rules Committee had convened in a necessary step before the bill can be brought to the floor of the House for debate and a vote. The meeting was contentious, with Democrats plainly unhappy about the shape of the legislation. Even House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas admitted that it was unusual for the House to move to vote on a bill without an accounting of its costs and impacts from the Congressional Budget Office, which late amendments had made impossible.\n\nThe AHCA, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act, has zero Democratic support in the House of Representatives, meaning that Republicans need to find all the votes needed to pass it on their own side of the aisle. But as hard-core conservatives demanded more and more changes in exchange for their votes, Trump and House Republican leadership found themselves losing support from the party’s less-doctrinaire members, who believed the bill had become too draconian in cutting funding and services to the most vulnerable.\n\nTrump, evidently frustrated with the process, sent his budget director, former House member Mick Mulvaney, to Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon with a blunt message: The president was finished negotiating, and demanded that the House vote on Friday. If the bill fails, he added, Trump will abandon the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and move on to his other legislative priorities, including tax reform and an infrastructure program.\n\nWhether moving on will be as easy as Trump seems to think is an open question. If this bill goes down, he will have suffered a major blow to his credibility as a leader -- particularly given his self-proclaimed mastery of the art of dealmaking.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nBut the decision to force his adversaries’ hand had the support of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who arguably has even more of his reputation riding on the AHCA. While the White House has no actual authority to compel a vote in the House of Representatives, Ryan was fully supportive of the gambit.\n\n“For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it’s collapsing and it’s failing families,” he said after a meeting of House Republicans. “And tomorrow we’re proceeding.”\n\nIndeed, the vote on the bill has been characterized by Trump and his surrogates as a sort of loyalty test. With virtually all Republicans in Congress having run on the promise to eliminate the ACA, they warn, failure to support AHCA will be seen as a betrayal that could cost them their seats in the next election. Not far below the surface is the suggestion that it is also a test of their loyalty to the first Republican president that many of them have ever served with.\n\nThe bill the House will proceed with underwent several last-minute changes meant to make it more attractive to wavering members.\n\nThe conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, who represent the core of the opposition to the bill, had demanded, among other things, that the bill eliminate a suite of “essential health benefits” that all insurance plans sold on the ACA health insurance exchanges were required to include. Among them are mental health and addiction services, outpatient treatments, hospital stays, maternity and newborn care, and more.\n\nRelated: Costs, Coverage of Latest Health Bill Revision a Mystery as Vote Looms\n\nIn the end, they were offered a half-measure. A series of amendments to the bill pushed the responsibility for determining what benefits are “essential” was pushed down to the states, a change that would take effect in 2018.\n\nAs an offset, the changes dedicated more money to the Patient and State Stability Fund, a program meant to help ease the transition to the new system by providing financial assistance to individuals, incentives to insurers, and other measures. The amendments add $15 billion to the PSSF, all dedicated to maternity and newborn care and addiction and mental health services -- two of the essential health benefits that lawmakers worry would be most likely to be eliminated.\n\nThe proposal would pay for the change by retaining through 2023 a 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax on people earning more than $200,000 per year, or married couples earning more than $250,000. However, a key demand of the Freedom Caucus in early negotiations had been an accelerated repeal of Obamacare’s taxes.\n\nAs of early Friday, it remained unclear whether or not the changes would be sufficient to bring along enough members of the Freedom Caucus or if the prospect of allowing states to slash essential health benefit requirements would drive Republicans at the other end of the conference’s ideological spectrum away from the bill.\n\nRelated: Failure to Pass the GOP Health Care Bill Could Doom Tax Reform This Year\n\nThe legislation wasn’t made any more attractive by a report from the Congressional Budget Office that came out late Thursday afternoon. The CBO report only dealt with the proposal as it had existed earlier in the week, and did not take the new amendments into account. However, it found that earlier amendments raised the cost of the bill without having any impact on the number of Americans with health insurance. The AHCA, CBO reported, would still result in 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage after a decade.\n\nThe fate of the bill in the House remained very much in question Friday morning, but even if Trump and Ryan are able to successfully call the bluff of the Freedom Caucus, the AHCA is facing an even tougher battle in the Senate. In the upper chamber, Republicans can only afford to lose a maximum of three votes -- assuming that Vice President Pence would break a tie -- but more than a dozen GOP senators have expressed serious skepticism about the legislation."

    "text": "America’s 16-years in Afghanistan has so far resulted in 2,216 dead soldiers, 20,049 casualties, and an estimated $800 billion in direct war costs -- not including veterans’ health and pension payments that could reach $400 billion before it’s all over. Add another $100 billion of USAID reconstruction costs, which is more than the cost of the Marshall Plan to rebuild western Europe, adjusted for inflation, and you’re well over a trillion dollars.\n\nThe Pentagon still has 8,400 troops in place, a figure Defense Secretary James Mattis may alter, which is why it’s especially troubling that Russia has decided to flex its territorial muscles and perhaps test the new Trump administration’s resolve.\n\nRelated: Gunmen Dressed as Medics Attack Military Hospital in Afghan Capital\n\nRussia stayed well clear of Afghanistan once the Soviet army was forced to retreat in 1989 after a decade of war. Now it’s back, “keen to enter the scene in a big way,” says Michael Kugelman of the Woodrow Wilson International Center.\n\nThis is not good news for strategists in Washington. Russia’s now supplying military and economic assistance to the Kabul regime. It’s also attempting to broker peace talks between the government and the still-insurgent Taliban, and Kabul is listening.\n\nWhat this means is very simple: Afghanistan’s turning into another competitive arena between Moscow and Washington.\n\nEvents have moved swiftly since the start of the year. Moscow is advancing the peace process it launched in December with a group that includes China and Pakistan, the latter a U.S. ally and one of Russia’s longtime adversaries.\n\nNot to be missed, Russia is also bringing the Taliban into this process, as Zamir Kabulov, Moscow’s special envoy to Afghanistan, confirmed last month. That puts Russia directly at odds with U.S. strategy.\n\nRelated: Trump Speaks With Afghan Leader, U.S. Commander Calls for More Troops\n\nWhen Rex Tillerson goes to Moscow next month, it’s safe to assume that Afghanistan will be added to his list that includes Ukraine and Syria. How will Tillerson handle this? Depending on how he plays it, Afghanistan could easily turn into one more reason President Trump’s idea of a new détente with Moscow won’t happen.\n\nThe U.S. has three current objectives: Defend the National Unity government in Kabul, fight the Islamic State, active in Afghanistan since 2014, and hold territory recaptured from the Taliban last year.\n\nNone of this is going especially well, which leaves the strategy vulnerable to challenge. The Kabul government is fractious, the Taliban plans to target provincial capitals in a spring offensive, and ISIS has expanded from its stronghold in the east of the country. Earlier this month it launched an attack against an Afghan military hospital in the capital.\n\nWhy is Russia suddenly so interested in Afghanistan? Its main concern is ISIS’ presence in a tenuously governed nation not far from its southern border. Militants from Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, are already fighting with ISIS in Afghanistan.\n\nRelated: Afghan Military Would Support More Foreign Troops, Official Says\n\nThe fear of ISIS is understandable. More worrisome in Washington and among U.S. military commanders is Moscow’s decision to work with the Taliban as an ally fighting the Islamic State.\n\nRussia’s new design in Afghanistan marks a big reversal in a couple of ways. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, Vladimir Putin was the first world leader to telephone the Bush White House to offer assistance. He quickly granted the Pentagon overflight privileges as it launched its initial campaign in Afghanistan, which Putin supported.\n\nIn subsequent years, Russia gave Kabul modest amounts of aid, including military assistance, approved by the NATO–Russia Council. But that changed with the crisis in Ukraine—another theater of U.S.–Russian contention where the clock is still ticking. In Afghanistan, what was once cooperation now has a competitive edge.\n\nThere’s a larger reason Tillerson must discuss Afghanistan in Moscow next month. Russia and China are both laying the groundwork for a unified Eurasia to match the Atlantic alliance. It’s early days, but this is the biggest challenge to Washington’s global leadership now on the horizon.\n\nRussia has its Eurasian Economic Union and China its “new silk road” and its Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which convenes China and the Central Asian republics. Afghanistan’s a piece of this picture. That’s why Beijing is on board as a key participant in the Moscow-sponsored peace process now getting under way."

    "text": "In an embarrassing setback for the Trump administration and Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, a planned vote on a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was cancelled Thursday afternoon after it became apparent that it did not have enough GOP support to pass. Both supporters of the legislation and conservative Republicans demanding changes to it said they were confident it would ultimately pass, but how that would happen remained unclear at best.\n\nThe American Health Care Act was never going to get any Democratic votes in the House, so Republicans have always known that it would require them to hold together most of their own members in order to get to 216 votes, the current level needed for a majority. However, the need for near unanimity gave the House Freedom Caucus, a loose collection of the chamber’s most conservative members, enormous leverage over the bill’s final form.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nThe Freedom Caucus spent the past week exercising that power, pressing House leadership and the Trump White House for concessions, such as accelerating the rollback of ACA-related taxes, changes to the rules for Medicaid eligibility, and the elimination of a requirement that insurance plans cover to “essential” health care treatments, including maternity care, mental health and addiction services, and more.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, nobody was happy. The members of the Freedom Caucus were said to be pressing for still more concessions, particularly the elimination of ACA regulations on the insurance industry. Meanwhile, House leaders were facing defections from the other end of the party’s spectrum, as less doctrinaire conservative members balked at the changes the Freedom Caucus was demanding.\n\nOn Thursday morning, there were estimated to be two dozen Republicans planning to vote against the bill. By the afternoon, despite a day of meetings, negotiations and deal-sweetening, that number had risen to around 30. GOP leaders can only afford to lose 21 votes.\n\nThe decision to postpone the vote appeared to catch the White House by surprise. Press Secretary Sean Spicer was insisting early Thursday afternoon that the vote would take place today. And President Trump, even after the postponement had been announced, appeared before cameras in advance of a meeting with representatives of the trucking industry and insisted that a vote was still taking place.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nLater, a White House deputy press secretary tried to spin the delay as favorably as possible, insisting that the move was made only to avoid having to vote in the middle of the night. White House officials insisted that a vote would be held Friday morning.\n\nHowever, in an interview with CNN, House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who actually controls when the House votes, was less sanguine. He said the Republican conference would meet tonight and that the Rules Committee would pass a rule allowing a vote to take place tomorrow. But when asked if there would be a morning vote, he committed only to starting debate on the bill.\n\nThe contents of the bill itself remain something of a mystery. On Monday, amended versions of the original bill were made available, revealing some of the changes that were made. However, there have been marathon negotiations since then, and it remained unclear as of late Thursday what the final piece of legislation would actually look like.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, in a revised analysis of the AHCA that included the changes from earlier in the week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the proposed revised plan would achieve even smaller deficit reduction over the coming decade than the original plan while doing little to address projected higher premiums and reduced coverage.\n\nAccording to the new CBO report, the revised House GOP plan would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion over the coming decade, or less than half the previously projected savings in the federal government. And the latest analysis continues to show a huge fall off in the number of Americans with health care coverage if Obamacare is replaced with this proposal. By 2026, an estimated 52 million people under the age of 65 would be uninsured under the House GOP approach.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nThe drama on Capitol Hill comes amid growing public discontent about the AHCA.\n\nA new poll by Quinnipiac University found that only 17 percent of American voters approve of the House Republican plan, while 56 percent are against it and 26 percent are undecided. The poll found that nearly half of the voters interviewed said they would be less likely to vote for their House member or senator if he or she votes for the plan, while 19 percent said they would be more likely to support their representative in that case.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are standing back and watching as the Republicans and the White House struggle to avert total disaster. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) told MSNBC Thursday that Trump and House GOP leaders are spinning their wheels in trying to craft a compromise that could survive a House vote and unite the party.\n\n“Their problem is they have a very bad piece of legislation,” Kildee said, adding that many rank and file Republicans are hearing from constituents who are afraid they will lose their coverage.\n\n“They are hearing loud and clear they don’t want it,” Kildee said.\n\nFormer Democratic governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell described the situation “as a train wreck, and it’s pretty hard to make it better.” The biggest losers could be more moderate Republicans if they are forced to go along in trying to get the bill through the House."

    "text": "In a victory for internet service providers like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T, the US Senate on Thursday voted to kill a set of Obama-era privacy regulations passed by the Federal Communication Commission in October.\n\nThe rules would have required ISPs to get explicit consent before sharing consumers’ web browsing data and other personal info with advertisers.\n\nRelated: The Net Neutrality Debate Explained\n\nThe vote passed 50 to 48, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against.\n\nThey were voting on a resolution proposed earlier this month by Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and co-sponsored by 24 other Republicans that broadly calls for the FCC’s rules to “have no force or effect.”\n\nThe resolution was proposed via the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a seldom-used law that the GOP is more widely applying to repeal federal regulations they contested late in the Obama administration with a simple majority vote. Republicans have a majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe resolution will now need to pass in the House of Representatives — where Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) proposed a similar resolution earlier this month — then be signed by President Donald Trump before going into effect.\n\nBecause the resolution uses the CRA, the FCC would be outlawed from creating similar privacy regulations if the repeal is passed.\n\nThe context\n\nThe FCC’s privacy rules were passed in a party-line vote last October after months of contention between Democrats and Republicans at the agency.\n\nRelated: Outgoing FCC chair warns against overturning net neutrality\n\nThe rules were something of a follow-up to the 2015 Open Internet Order, which famously classified the internet as a public utility. That set in place the current net-neutrality rules — which forbid ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing sites as they see fit — but also left the FCC in charge of ISPs' privacy regulations.\n\nThe privacy rules apply a set of guidelines to ISPs about how they treat consumer data, but the most notable bit would force them to obtain explicit consent before they’re able to share “sensitive” consumer information with advertisers.\n\nIn other words, ISPs would need you to opt-in to their data collection policies before they’re able to take that data and use it for targeted ads, instead of selling it by default and requiring you to manually opt-out. When people are given the explicit option, they are typically less likely to accept it. That means less potential revenue for ISPs.\n\nMuch of what the FCC deemed “sensitive” fell in line with looser, pre-net-neutrality privacy guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission — things like financial, health, and geo-location info — but the agency notably added web browsing and app usage data to the list as well.\n\nThat specific provision is not scheduled to go into effect until later this December, however.\n\nEven under these would-be privacy rules, which now appear doomed, ISPs would not be required to get opt-in consent for other bits of personal information like email addresses.\n\nCurrent FCC chairman Ajit Pai has strongly opposed those privacy rules, and voted against them as a commissioner last October. Last month, he halted one part of the privacy rules that would’ve broadly required ISPs to “engage in reasonable data security practices.” Pai and GOP commissioner Michael O’Rielly currently have a 2-1 majority at the agency.\n\nPai feels the privacy rules unfairly target ISPs and give internet companies like Google and Facebook the ability to harvest more consumer data and dominate digital advertising. Google and Facebook are by far the two biggest players in the digital ad industry today.\n\nWebsites like Google and Facebook are still regulated by the FTC’s looser guidelines, and thus are not forced to obtain opt-in consent before they collect and sell your web browsing and app usage data. This is partly why you may see ads personalized to your browsing history when you browse the web.\n\nRelated: Trump taps net neutrality opponent Ajit Pai to head FCC\n\nISPs aren’t happy about this discrepancy, and have petitioned the FCC to roll back the rules entirely. Telecom industry groups have said keeping the rules could limit ISPs’ ability to provide otherwise free or low-cost services. Wireless industry trade group CTIA also argued in a note to the FCC last week that web browsing and app usage history are not “sensitive” information.\n\nThe debate comes at a time when ISPs like Verizon are increasingly interested in boosting their own digital advertising presence.\n\nDespite the fact that internet companies are not covered here, they have also opposed the regulations, mainly because they do not want a precedent to be set that may apply to their data collection policies in the future. Groups representing Google, Facebook, and the like, urged Congress to repeal the privacy rules using the CRA this past January.\n\nAnother shot at the net-neutrality rules\n\nLike many issues in Washington today, this is a heated debate drawn squarely along party lines.\n\nDemocrats and consumer advocacy groups argue that it is fair to apply more stringent privacy rules to ISPs because it is generally more difficult to switch internet providers than use different websites — particularly in rural and low-income areas with less choices between ISPs — and because ISPs are more easily capable of seeing everything you do over the internet connections they sell. (Though it’s worth noting that behemoths like Google and Facebook are able to reach beyond their own sites.)\n\nThey also note that many websites provide free services in exchange for their targeted ads, whereas ISPs still charge relatively high fees for access to internet service.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Make It More Expensive for You to Binge-Watch Netflix\n\nRepublicans and other conservatives, meanwhile, call the privacy regulations an overreach of federal agency power.\n\n“In reality, this is just yet another avenue designed to give the FCC more control over the Internet that should be open,” said David Williams, president of the right-leaning Taxpayers Protection Alliance, in a statement in favor of the act on Tuesday.\n\nPai wants to create a single framework for both ISPs and internet companies that allows them all to be regulated under guidelines similar to those from the FTC.\n\n\"All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency,\" said Pai and acting FTC chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement upon the FCC’s data security stay last month. \"Until that happens, however, we will work together on harmonizing the FCC’s privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTC’s standards for other companies in the digital economy.\"\n\nIf privacy enforcement of ISPs is eventually removed from the FCC, there are doubts over whether or not the FTC has the authority to regulate ISPs’ privacy practices at all. Apart from the restrictions set by the CRA, an appeals court decision last year said AT&T was exempt from FTC oversight because it was a “common carrier” — a title that was set for all internet providers through the 2015 net-neutrality order.\n\nPai says that, if the privacy rules are reversed, the FCC will still be able to regulate ISPs’ privacy policies using Title II, Section 222 of the Communications Act. Those regulations are less stringent than the Obama-era regulations, however, and do not cover web browsing or app usage data.\n\nTitle II is the linchpin of the 2015 net-neutrality order, and the thing that gives the FCC much of its regulatory power over ISPs. But it’s also the thing Pai and other Republicans most wish to dismantle as part of a larger rollback of the net-neutrality rules. If that happens, as anticipated, it could further reduce any privacy-related oversight of ISPs.\n\nEven if the net-neutrality order is undone, ISPs like Verizon and AT&T would retain “common carrier” status because they offer telephone services. That could create a situation where no agency has clear regulatory authority over ISPs, and thus require further action to expand FTC authority. That appears unlikely with the deregulatory-minded GOP in charge.\n\nDemocrats blasted Thursday's vote as taking too much control of personal data out of consumers’ hands. \"This is yet another repeal without a replace,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), likening the vote to the ongoing healthcare debate.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This is the single biggest step back in online privacy in many years,\" he continued.\n\nA final rollback of the rules appears all-but-certain at this point, be it through the Congressional action here or an eventual FCC move. ISPs, advertisers, and internet companies can breathe a sigh of relief, but privacy advocates can consider it a missed opportunity.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "text": "When public officials complain about infrastructure in the United States, airports are among their most popular targets. Former vice president Joe Biden memorably compared New York’s LaGuardia Airport to one you would find “in some third-world country.” More recently, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump railed against the condition of the country’s airports, and in his inaugural address promised “gleaming” new facilities across the country.\n\nBut for all the agreement about how much work the nation’s airports need, there’s little clarity on just what needs to be done, how much it will cost, and where the money is going to come from.\n\nRelated: Trump's Trillion Dollar Infrastructure Plan Could Be DOA\n\nTestimony delivered before a Senate subcommittee on Thursday by Gerald L. Dillingham, the Director of Physical Infrastructure Issues for the Government Accountability Office, claims there is a vast gap between what the Federal Aviation Administration considers necessary spending at the nation’s airports and what the industry’s trade group says is needed. The FAA says that over the next five years, airports will require about $32.5 billion in infrastructure development spending. However, the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) says the number is closer to $100 billion.\n\nThe GAO says the gap is largely due how the FAA considers infrastructure projects: It only looks at those eligible for funding through the federal government’s Airport Improvement Program, a grant system that is part of the larger Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which gets its money from various taxes on the airline industry.\n\nThe primary difference between projects that are eligible for AIP funding and those that aren’t is in their ultimate purpose. The AIP money is typically spent on elements of a facility that are essential to the physical arrival and departure of airplanes and passengers. That includes land acquisition, building new runways, and construction of roadways and other systems for moving people through the airport.\n\nWhat the AIP does not fund, though, are many of the things that, to the average passenger, have a lot to do with whether they feel as though they are in a “gleaming” modern facility, or in Biden’s “third-world” airport. That’s everything else that generates revenue for airports and commercial enterprises, from ticket counters to retail space.\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump’s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nOne possibility for generating additional funds that could be used for other improvements would be to raise or eliminate the cap on what’s known as the Passenger Facility Charge -- a $4.50 per-leg fee that is added to every passenger’s ticket, up to a maximum of $18 for a round-trip purchase.\n\nDillingham says, “In 2015, GAO estimated that funding from these sources totaled an average of $10.3 billion annually (2013 dollars), $2.7 billion less than airports’ planned development costs.”\n\nHowever, raising or eliminating the PFC cap is controversial, not least of all with the airlines that worry that increasing the costs borne by passengers will result in an overall reduction in business. Indeed, the GAO’s analysis determined that, depending on how price-sensitive consumers are, a PFC increase could impact the growth rate of airlines’ businesses.\n\nRelated: Trump Again Calls for Rebuilding US Infrastructure in Inaugural Address\n\nHowever, the testimony appeared to come down primarily on the side of recommending increased PFC as a means of funding airport improvements. “[H]igher PFCs can provide airports more control over local capital funding decisions, including the ability to decide how to apply PFC revenues to support capital projects and thus how those revenues might influence airline rates and charges.”\n\n“Generally, PFCs offer airports relative independence over investment decisions at their airports. While airports must notify and consult with the airlines on how they spend PFCs, airlines cannot block these decisions if the FAA approves. Airlines can choose to serve other airports, however, so airports still have an incentive to listen to airline concerns.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/23/Hidden-Dangers-Government-Tweets-and-Not-Just-Trump-s",
    "text": "While some of President Trump’s executive orders have stirred debate in the initial weeks of his administration, it’s his tweets that have generated the most controversy. Using Twitter to accuse former President Obama of ordering a wiretap on Trump Tower during the election is a prime example.\n\nIt’s somewhat ironic then that a series of internal directives issued just after Trump took office were aimed at limiting communications from some U.S. government agencies to the outside world. Interestingly — especially coming from a president who takes to Twitter every chance he gets — these directives covered not only communications like press releases, but also blog posts and the use of social media.\n\nIn response, one former Obama administration official said this was “a dark time” at federal agencies. Another pundit stated Trump was “at war with science.” Some agencies even “went rogue” by creating unofficial Twitter accounts in defiance of the Trump administration.\n\nRelated: Glued to the TV, Apparently, Trump Fires a Tweet Into the Comey Hearing\n\nDespite the outcry, there are some very sensible reasons for limiting certain types of government communications, especially with respect to the use of social media. Of course, communication between agencies and the public is critical in order to maintain transparency. Clear communication is also needed to educate the public about programs to enhance their effectiveness. However, there's a fine line between providing useful information to the public and engaging in acts of political advocacy. Even more concerning is that social media can give regulators an end-run around the checks and balances of the regulatory process.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 set up a predictable process whereby agencies notify the public about new rules, and the public has an opportunity to give comments before a rule becomes law. Unfortunately, regulatory agencies routinely circumvent APA procedural requirements. Roughly half of all regulations between 1995 and 2012 avoided the notice-and-comment process altogether.\n\nEven worse, regulators can also influence the public’s behavior in ways virtually identical to regulation without ever issuing a formal rule. These actions are what John D. Graham, dean of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, and I refer to as “stealth regulation,” and the government’s use of social media is one form.\n\nRelated: Here’s Who Wins With Trump’s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nPerhaps the most common form of stealth regulation is the issuance of guidance documents and other policy memoranda. While usually not legally binding on the public, these documents can be binding with respect to government workers, making them powerful tools for implementing policy changes. Some of the most controversial actions of the Obama administration came in this form, from limiting deportations of illegal aliens to prompting schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nWhether or not one agrees with the policies themselves, it’s highly problematic when sweeping government actions receive no public input, no analysis from technical experts and escape the rulemaking procedures that both political parties have accepted and adhered to for decades.\n\nColumbia Law Professor Tim Wu argues that agencies should also use threats, another form of stealth regulation, as a policy tool, especially in instances where an industry is undergoing rapid change, for example, from emerging technologies. But the threat of actions by the government against private citizens can be enough to ruin lives. Threats to retailers from the Consumer Product Safety Commission helped put the popular office-magnet company Buckeyballs out of business. And, yes, threats can come via tweets. Trump himself has demonstrated a dangerous tendency towards singling out individual companies on Twitter, especially those thinking about shifting jobs to other countries.\n\nRelated: This Big Washington Battle Could Hit You in the Wallet\n\nIn 2014, the EPA worked with the Sierra Club to promote a clean water regulation on Facebook and Twitter, employing a controversial online tool known as Thunderclap to reach hundreds of thousands of people and encourage them to comment on the proposed rule. In Congressional testimony, the EPA administrator would cite comments from the public as evidence of public support for the policy, but a Government Accountability Office report later determined that the EPA had violated anti-propaganda laws with its actions.\n\nNone of this is to say that regulators, or the president, should be completely banned from using social media. Some communications are clearly beneficial. However, the line between providing beneficial information to the public and engaging in political advocacy, outright propaganda or threats is rapidly blurring in this new digital age.\n\nIronically, one way to rein in abusive government use of social media may be to have the government write updated guidelines on the topic. The Office of Management and Budget is the logical agency to do this; it already writes guidelines for countless other regulatory agency functions. Such guidance should be published publicly in draft form in the Federal Register, it should be subject to rigorous third party review (perhaps from the National Academy of Sciences) and the public should have adequate time to comment on the guidelines.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Golden Opportunity: Slashing 179,000 Pages of Federal Regulations\n\nThe role of social media in society is still playing itself out, just as the president himself is using social media in novel and unprecedented ways. There are both pros and cons to these developments. Guidelines for social media use could go a long way toward establishing norms in this area, with respect to the federal government. It would help limit those cases where a tweet becomes more than a tweet — when it becomes stealth regulation.\n\n— James Broughel is a research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he focuses on federal, state and local regulation."

The AG, a Democrat and avid supporter of Hillary Clinton, also went after the Trump Foundation and forced it to desist from seeking outside donations.\n\nNow Schneiderman has hired one of Bharara’s top public-corruption prosecutors, Howard Master, whose focus New York magazine says will include “issues relating to the Trump White House.” Among Master’s successful prosecutions was the corruption conviction of New York State House Speaker Sheldon Silver, The Wall Street Journal said.\n\nTo strengthen the Washington chops of his team of some 650 lawyers, New York’s Daily News says Schneiderman has also hired Eric Haren, former chief counsel to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of California.\n\nThe animus Schneiderman has for Trump sometimes seems to go beyond prosecutorial zeal, however. In a statement last July to The Forward, a newspaper that bills itself as the voice of New York’s Jewish community, the AG said, “As a Democrat and a Jewish American, I feel that I have a duty to help prevent such a dangerous, offensive, and grossly uninformed individual from occupying the Oval Office.”\n\nLast October, the Journal editorial page accused Schneiderman of misusing “his prosecutorial authority to attack his political enemies” (read Trump) and for selectively targeting the Trump Foundation.\n\nRelated: Trump Hotels Settles With N.Y. Attorney General Over Data Breaches\n\nBut a recent story in Politico Magazine has Schneiderman sticking to the line that he is just doing his job. It quotes him as telling a caller to a public-radio talk show that he doubted whether any of his investigations would lead to Trump’s impeachment and that he is simply out to enforce the law.\n\nThat may be the case; however, it’s rare for a prosecutor to pen an op-ed about the subject of legal action. Yet in August 2013, in a column for the Daily News about Trump and Trump University, Schneiderman wrote, “Some 5,000 hardworking people from all over the country fell for Donald Trump’s sales pitch and ended up getting taken. They were victims of a high-pressure bait and switch. That’s consumer fraud. As the state’s chief law enforcement officer, it’s my job to see that perpetrators of fraud are brought to justice. Even if the perpetrator’s name is Donald Trump.”\n\nNow Schneiderman’s new hires seem to be sending the message: “Even if the perpetrator’s name is President Donald Trump.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/23/Costs-Coverage-Latest-Health-Bill-Revision-Mystery-Vote-Looms",
    "text": "If Republicans in the House of Representatives press forward with a plan to vote today on an yet another amended version of the American Health Care Act, the proposal for repealing and replacing Obamacare, they are likely going to do it without an analysis of the bill by the Congressional Budget Office. However, given the kinds of changes to the bill that are reportedly being considered as House leadership and the White House try to wrangle the votes they need, they probably don’t want one anyway.\n\nWith the bill in danger of failing because of opposition from the most conservative Republicans in the House, the Trump administration and top Republican lawmakers in the House are reportedly entertaining the possibility of granting the holdouts a huge victory: the elimination of what the ACA calls “essential health benefits” that every insurance plan must cover.\n\nRelated: Has Trump Overplayed a Losing Hand in His First Legislative Test?\n\nCurrent law requires that all major medical health care plans cover ten different types of “essential” care, including hospitalization, outpatient services, maternity and newborn care, mental health and addiction services and more.\n\nOpponents of the law have long objected to the requirement, claiming that it forces consumers to purchase coverage that they may neither need nor want and drives up premium prices, making care unaffordable for some.\n\nLate Wednesday, Politico reported that the White House and members of the House Freedom Caucus, the right-wing lawmakers who are threatening to scuttle the bill because they don’t believe it goes far enough in undoing the Affordable Care Act’s changes to insurance markets, had agreed in principle to add language ending the essential care requirements in the bill.\n\nLawmakers were already facing the real possibility of having to vote on the AHCA without a CBO score of the final version of the bill. The budget agency’s analysis of the initial version of the proposal released last week was brutal. It found that the proposed changes would result in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance within a decade -- by choice or by design -- even as costs rose and benefits dwindled for the poor and elderly.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nAfter House leadership released amended language Monday night, though, including changes to tax credits for older Americans, tweaking the repeal of ACA’s Medicaid expansion and more, the old CBO score became inoperative. There were reports that the agency was racing to prepare a new estimate of the amended bill in advance of Thursday’s expected vote. But if major changes like the elimination of the essential care requirements are shoehorned in at the last moment, the odds of seeing a CBO score of the final bill on Thursday are very slim.\n\nFor the bill’s supporters, that’s probably just as well. That’s because if conservatives are indeed successful in gutting the essential care requirement, CBO will likely project that even more Americans will be without health insurance under the AHCA.\n\nThe CBO itself warned Congress of this last year, trying to wave lawmakers off of efforts to allow the reintroduction of bare-bones insurance coverage by signaling that it would not consider people who are not protected from the serious financial risk of unexpected health crises as actually insured.\n\nCBO and the the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that absent the essential care requirements, some policies offered to people receiving the AHCA’s tax credits “would probably not provide enough financial protection against high medical costs to meet the broad definition of coverage that CBO and JCT have typically used in the past—that is, a comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost medical events and various services, including those provided by physicians and hospitals.”\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nThe agency continued, “If there were no clear definition of what type of insurance product people could use their tax credit to purchase, everyone who received the tax credit would have access to some limited set of health care services, at a minimum, but not everyone would have insurance coverage that offered financial protection against a high-cost or catastrophic medical event; CBO and JCT would not count those people with limited health benefits as having coverage.”\n\nWhat that means is that a successful move to eliminate essential benefits would invite an even more damning analysis of the bill from the Congressional budget watchdog agency -- something that GOP leaders, struggling to hold together a coalition of lawmakers willing to pass the AHCA can ill afford.\n\nSo it will be no surprise if GOP leaders who normally preach fiscal responsibility and a commitment to budget discipline are happy to move forward on a vote before the agency charged with assessing the fiscal consequences of the ACHA has a chance to render a verdict."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/23/Secret-Service-Won-t-Get-60-Million-More-Protect-Trumps",
    "text": "U.S. Secret Service spending to provide security for the lavish and far-flung travel of President Trump and his family – including Trump’s now almost weekly trips to his Florida resort for presidential consultations and golf – has gotten so out of hand that the agency recently requested a $60 million increase in its budget for the coming year.\n\nBut The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the request was turned down by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), headed by director Mick Mulvaney. The Secret Service was told to try to find the money through savings in other areas of its budget.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe request, contained in internal agency documents obtained by the newspaper, was an urgent plea for more resources after Trump and his family’s travel and lifestyle had begun to stretch the Secret Services resources to the limits.\n\nNearly half of the additional money that was sought in the fiscal 2018 budget request – or $26.8 million – was to be used to pay to protect Trump’s family and private home in New York’s Trump Tower. The remaining $33 million was for security related to travel incurred by “the president, vice president and other visiting heads of state.”\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump and her young son, Barron, live in the family’s three-floor Manhattan penthouse, while Trump largely divides his time between the White House during the week and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on weekends. Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago last Friday for his fifth post-inauguration weekend trip, just a day after OMB issued a federal budget proposal for the coming year seeking $54 billion in cuts in many government programs and agencies to offset the cost of a major military buildup.\n\nThe government spent an estimated $10 million on Trump’s first three trips to Mar-a-Lago in late January and February, according to a recent investigation by The Washington Post. At that rate, travel and security for Trump and his family could run up hundreds of millions in costs by the end of his term.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nTrump’s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., travel extensively overseas in running the family business and they receive round-the-clock Secret Service protection. Eric Trump’s trip to Uruguay in January to check on the progress of a Trump hotel reportedly cost taxpayers nearly $98,000 for agents’ hotel rooms.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, serve as senior advisers to the president, and they and their children are also afforded Secret Service protection.\n\nIronically, Trump more than once criticized the cost of President Obama’s travel, saying it was “unbelievable” that Obama’s trips were “costing taxpayers millions of dollars.”\n\nHe vowed during the campaign to save the public money by working tirelessly in Washington and skipping extraneous or overly expensive trips. Since then, First Family travel and leisure has been taxing Secret Service resources. And that, over time, could degrade the quality of protection for the commander in chief.\n\nThe Secret Service acknowledged last Friday that a 26-year-old California man with a history of mental illness who breached White House security March 10 remained on the White House grounds for more than 15 minutes before Secret Service agents detected and arrested him. Trump was in the executive mansion at the time of the incident, and the man never got close to him.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nThat was only the latest in a series of potentially disastrous mishaps dating back years. In 2014, for example, an intruder with a knife managed to slip into the White House before he was tackled by an off-duty agent in the East Room.\n\nThe Secret Service’s latest budget request for 2018 operations is being kept under wraps, but the agency requested $734 million for its fiscal 2017 operations and support activities. The Post quoted a person familiar with Secret Service budget discussions as saying the request for $60 million of additional funding was submitted in late February, before being turned down as excessive.\n\n“That means the agency will likely have to divert other spending to handle the additional burden,” the newspaper reported. The agency plays other vital roles besides protecting the president and his family, including investigating cyber crimes, ferreting out counterfeit money operations and cases involving missing and exploited minors.\n\nThe Secret Service’s annual budget last year was $2.2 billion, or 3.2 percent of the Department of Homeland Security’s overall $66.8 billion in spending. The agency, with wide ranging responsibilities, employs about 6,700 full-time equivalent workers, including about 3,000 agents. Salaries are better than average, and agent working long, grueling hours and traveling overseas are entitled to overtime, to a point.\n\nLast October, USA Today reported that at least 1,000 Secret Service agents, or about a third of the agent workforce, had already maxed out on annual overtime and salary allowance because of the extraordinary demands of providing protection to Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and other presidential candidates. Some of the agency’s most senior agents reached their combined compensation limits of $160,300 a year as early as last June, according to the report."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/22/House-Intel-Chair-Says-Intel-Agencies-May-Have-Spied-Trump",
    "text": "In a sometimes contradictory and confusing press conference held in a Capitol Hill hallway on Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes suggested that at least one US intelligence agency had “incidentally” intercepted a large amount of communications between Donald Trump’s transition team and foreign officials. At one point, Nunes appeared to suggest that then-president-elect Trump’s own communications might have been intercepted.\n\n“I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the Intelligence Community incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition,” Nunes read from a prepared statement at the beginning of his press conference.\n\nRelated: Former Trump Campaign Chair Worked to ‘Benefit the Putin Government’\n\n“Details about US persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or the Trump team.”\n\nWithout explaining exactly how he had acquired the information, Nunes said that he had been given access to “dozens” of intelligence reports compiled between November of last year and January.\n\nHe said that the information related to Trump and his team had been obtained by intelligence agencies legally as part of legitimate foreign intelligence operations. Nunes also stressed that the collection was incidental, meaning that Trump and his associates were not the original targets of the surveillance but were communicating with one or more targets.\n\nNunes said that despite the legality of the collection, he was troubled by the fact that the information was retained, shared among intelligence agencies, and that the names of at least some of the individuals whose communications were picked up were identified in the shared reports.\n\nRelated: It’s Easy to See Where the Trump-Russia Investigation Is Headed\n\n“The House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate surveillance and its subsequent dissemination to determine...who was aware of it, why it was not disclosed to Congress, who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, and whether any laws, regulations or procedures were violated,” he said.\n\nDespite repeating that the information was collected incidentally, though, Nunes repeatedly used language suggesting that the surveillance was somehow directed against Trump. At one point, he said, “I was concerned that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked if he believed that the intelligence agencies were “spying” on the president-elect, Nunes responded coyly, saying the answer depended on one’s definition of “spying.”\n\nRelated: Competing Narratives in Trump ‘Wiretap’ Story Lack Facts\n\nIn one extended exchange, Nunes said that Trump’s own communications had been intercepted, before backtracking.\n\nQuestioner: Was the president also part of that incidental collection? His communications?\n\nNunes: Yes.\n\nQuestioner 2: Let me just clarify. The President of the United States’ personal communications were intercepted --\n\nNunes: Well, I think we have to...when we talk about intelligence products here we have to be very careful. From what I know right now, it looks like incidental collection. We don’t know exactly how that was picked up, but we’re trying to get to the bottom of it.\n\nQuestioner 2: The president of the United States personal communications were subject to incidental collection, not in specific targeting.\n\nNunes: It’s possible. We won’t know until we get the information on Friday, and that’s why, look, I think the NSA is going to comply. I am concerned that we don’t know whether or not the FBI is going to comply. I’ve placed a call I’m waiting to hopefully talk to director Comey later today.\n\nRelated: Did Trump Just Declare War on the FBI?\n\nAnother reporter quickly returned to the subject for clarification.\n\nQuestioner 3: You said the president’s communications were incidentally collected. But then you said it was also “possible.” So was it collected or was it possible it was collected?\n\nNunes: I just don’t know the answer to that.\n\nQuestioner 3: So you don’t know if the president’s communications were --\n\nNunes: I know there was incidental collection regarding the president-elect and his team. I don’t know if it was physically a phone call.\n\nQuestioner 3: And you don’t know if it was the president himself, his communications.\n\nNunes: I do not.\n\nQuestioner 4: Mr. Chairman did the president’s conversations or anything about the president himself appear in the intelligence reports? Is that what you’re saying?\n\nNunes: I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence in what appears to be raw -- I shouldn’t say raw -- but intelligence reporting channels. As best as I can say that until I get all the information that we’ve requested.\n\nWhether justified or not, the announcement from Nunes will likely be seized upon by the president’s supporters as the vindication of Trump, who has accused his predecessor, former president Barack Obama, of ordering a wiretap on his offices at Trump Tower. At a hearing before Nunes’ committee on Monday, FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers, both denied that any such order had been -- or could have been -- given.\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Wednesday, Nunes had traveled to the White House to brief administration staff."

The remaining $33 million would pay for travel costs from trips involving Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and visiting heads of state.\n\nRelated: Why Spending $1 Trillion a Year on Defense Won’t Make Us Safer\n\nThe request for the 2018 fiscal budget, submitted in February, was rejected by the Office of Management and Budget, the Post reported, meaning the Secret Service will probably have to divert spending from other areas — such as cybercrime investigation and counterfeit-money operations — to cover the costs.\n\nThe full budget for protecting the Trumps is not publicly available, however former Secret Service agents interviewed by The Post speculated it's much higher than that of other presidents, considering the family's habit of traveling.

    "text": "One day before the House is scheduled to vote on the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump increasingly looks like a gambler who has pushed all his chips into the middle of the table. Trump has wagered his reputation as a dealmaker and a large share of the political capital that came with his election on his ability to ram the American Health Care Act through Congress. And he did it all without ever really looking at his cards.\n\nTrump appears to have seriously miscalculated in at least three areas: First, members of the House Freedom Caucus are far more resistant to the persuasions of the dealmaker-in-chief than the president seems to have realized. Second, public opposition to the bill is much stronger than expected, meaning even its supporters aren’t deeply committed to it. And third, the bill faces adamant opposition from multiple Republicans in the Senate, where losing more than two votes would be fatal.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nAs a result, the president is facing the real possibility -- perhaps even the likelihood -- of an embarrassing defeat in his first major foray into the legislative arena.\n\nThe bill, formally part of a budget reconciliation measure, hangs by a thread in the House of Representatives, where GOP leaders are faced with lockstep Democratic opposition and can afford to lose only 20 of their members without killing the bill. Currently, more than two dozen members of the caucus have expressed serious reservations or outright opposition, leading to a flurry of last-minute meetings between Trump and recalcitrant lawmakers, including a high-profile presidential visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s intense involvement suggests that Trump understands the gravity of the situation.\n\n“If Trump can't make this happen within his own party after the GOP ran four consecutive elections against Obamacare, he'll take a big hit,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “The chances that Trump will get other big bills through Congress are also diminished.”\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nTrump built his political success on his willingness to flout traditional “rules” of the game. But, Sabato warns, he’s now in real danger.\n\n“A new President almost always gets his signature proposals from a Congress controlled by his own party,” he said. “If the health care legislation goes down, Trump will have broken another iron rule of politics--but this is a rule necessary for a successful Presidency.”\n\nTo be sure, a victory for Trump on the House vote would be a validation that his highly touted bargaining skills as a New York real estate mogul are indeed adaptable to his new role as president. If Trump shows that he can force recalcitrant lawmakers from both parties into line, that skill will be critical in steering the remainder of his top agenda items – including tax cuts, building up the military and constructing a wall along the southern border with Mexico -- through Congress.\n\nBut experienced analysts see little likelihood of things playing out that way.\n\nRelated: GOP Health Plan Reduces the Federal Deficit by $2.4 Trillion Over Two Decades\n\n“You want to score early, but you have to make sure what you’re doing is reasonably well thought out and not slapped together in the interest of haste,” said Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University and a congressional expert. “Given the kind of general disorder that has characterized the Trump administration, I don’t have a lot of confidence that this is thoughtful legislation.”\n\n“And I think that legislation done in haste is likely to come back and haunt the people who wrote the bill – and that’s more the members of the House of Representatives than the president,” he added.\n\nTrump’s first major misperception was that it would be a simple matter for him to bring the members of the House Freedom Caucus along with him, even if they weren’t enamored of all the elements of the bill. But the Freedom Caucus has demonstrated, time and again, that compromise isn’t in their DNA, and that they pay no price at the polls when they challenge party leaders from the right.\n\nIn his appearance on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Trump showed that he still doesn’t really understand what he’s dealing with when he confronted the holdouts with warnings that they will lose their seats in the next election if they don’t back him on this bill. But the members of the Freedom Caucus are, for the most part, bulletproof in their home districts.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\n“The Freedom Caucus members are solid electorally,” said UVA’s Sabato. “It would be tough to defeat any of them in a primary because they voted against what they'll insist is ‘Obamacare Lite’.”\n\nIt has also been difficult for the White House to gin up real momentum behind AHCA because the more people learn about it, the less they like it. The headline numbers from the Congressional Budget Office analysis released last week -- 24 million fewer Americans with insurance under the proposal and higher out-of-pocket costs for older people -- was a body blow to Republicans’ insistence that they were replacing the Affordable Care Act with something better in terms of cost and effectiveness.\n\nA new poll by Morning Consult and Politico published Wednesday indicates that voters are growing uneasy about the Republican Obamacare replacement plan and that a “strong plurality” believe GOP lawmakers are moving too quickly to overhaul the country’s health care system, including Medicaid.\n\nWith a vote in the House likely to come on Thursday or early Friday, 43 percent of voters believe congressional Republicans should slow down the process while they take a closer look at the evolving replacement plan. Just 17 percent of voters say that the Republicans are moving at the right pace.\n\nRelated: Trump May Have Just Handed Conservatives a Loss on Obamacare Repeal\n\nNotably, Obamacare continues to rise in popularity the closer the Republicans get to voting on a replacement plan. Despite the GOP’s relentless criticism of the programs’ inadequacies, 46 percent of voters currently support Obamacare -– one of its best showings since the advent of the 2010 legislation. By comparison, the popularity of the Republicans’ AHCA has been losing altitude in popularity.\n\nVoters are divided over the likely impact of the GOP plan on the quality of their health care, with 32 percent saying it would make it worse and 28 percent saying it would make it better.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most inexplicably, Trump and House leadership are fixated on passing AHCA through the lower chamber of Congress despite clear signs that it’s basically a suicide mission.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed yesterday to try to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor next week if it survives its first big test in the House. “We’re not slowing down,” McConnell told reporters. “We will reach a conclusion on health care next week.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Cuts to Medical Research May Not Get Past Congress\n\nHowever, key Republican members of the Senate could not have been clearer about their unwillingness to support the AHCA, meaning that unless something completely unexpected happens, the bill is dead on arrival in that chamber.\n\nThat means Trump is asking Republican House members to expose themselves to the downside of a vote for the bill with a near-guarantee that there is no upside.\n\nEven for a supposed master of the “Art of the Deal,” that’s an awfully tough sell."

    "text": "The Trump administration probably could have done without any more bombshell revelations this week, trapped as it is in a struggle to pass the House attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act even as it deals with the news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether the president’s campaign advisers colluded with Russian intelligence agencies during the election. But the Associated Press apparently missed the memo.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, the newswire published an explosive story alleging that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, already known to have done very well-compensated work for the Russia-friendly former leader of Ukraine, had made millions advising a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin on public relations strategies within the United States aimed at boosting the image of the Kremlin.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nIn 2005 a memo obtained by the AP, Manafort lays out a strategy that, “can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.” The plan he had drawn up, Manafort continued, “will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.”\n\nThe AP report outlines a years-long relationship between Manafort and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire and Putin confidant considered a powerful, behind-the-scenes figures in Moscow. In a statement to the AP, Manafort denied that he had worked on behalf of Putin’s interests, despite the plain language of the memo.\n\n“I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,” Manafort said. “My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests.”\n\nIn general, there is nothing illegal or necessarily improper about an American citizen advising foreign governments or even working on their behalf in Washington. However, the Manafort memo represents a special case on multiple levels.\n\nRelated: It’s Easy to See Where the Trump-Russia Investigation Is Headed\n\nFirst of all, Manafort is already suspected of having worked for foreign governments in the past, including Ukraine’s Russia-backed former president Viktor Yanukovych, without making the disclosures required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Revelations about his work for Ukraine led to his departure from the Trump campaign, which he ran from March to August of 2016, a period that included the crucial run-up to the Republican National Convention.\n\nSecond, he has adamantly denied working on behalf of Russian interests in the past. The AP’s reporting, which uncovered both the memo written for Deripaska and records indicating that Manafort was paid tens of millions of dollars by the oligarch, now casts serious doubt on that claim.\n\nMost importantly for the Trump administration, though, is that fact the report comes out less than 48 hours after FBI Director James Comey took the highly unusual step of revealing that his agency is investigating not only the widely accepted accusation that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election but also the possibility that members of Trump’s campaign team colluded with Russian intelligence agents in that effort.\n\nIn 2015, computer hackers broke into systems at the Democratic National Committee and into email accounts belonging to close associates of Hillary Clinton, who would go on to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Data from those hacks was later released in an obvious effort to damage Clinton during the following year’s election.\n\nRelated: Why Spending $1 Trillion a Year on Defense Won’t Make Us Safer\n\nLast summer Roger Stone, a Republican political operative and longtime Trump associate made multiple public statements indicating that he had advance knowledge of the information that was going to be released. High ranking members of the Trump administration, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have faced criticism for failing to disclose contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyakov prior to the new administration taking office.\n\nThe allegations that Trump’s campaign was somehow complicit in the Russian hacking effort has become a major distraction to an administration already overburdened with them as it struggles through its first 100 days in office. The AP’s new revelations about Manafort will only amplify them."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/22/Failure-Pass-GOP-Health-Care-Bill-Could-Doom-Tax-Reform-Year",
    "text": "During the congressional Republicans’ retreat in Philadelphia in late January, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) outlined a highly ambitious legislative agenda for the year.\n\nDelivering an electronic chalk talk for members behind closed doors, Ryan predicted that the GOP would repeal and replace Obamacare by April, fund President Trump’s border wall shortly after that, and then enact a sweeping and historic package of corporate and individual tax cuts by August – just in time for members to depart for a summer vacation.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Charge of the Obamacare-Lite Brigade\n\nRyan, the quintessential policy wonk on Capitol Hill, outlined a legislative scheme to use obscure budget reconciliation rules to fast track passage of the health care and tax legislation and circumvent any threat of Democratic filibusters. By the time he was finished with his presentation, Ryan reportedly received a standing ovation and cheers from the lawmakers who attended the session.\n\nYet two months later, Ryan’s flow chart of legislative action is being threatened by his own party in the House and Senate, and everything is riding on the leadership somehow prevailing in the two chambers.\n\nThat’s because the health care replacement legislation is the lynchpin of the Trump-GOP agenda for the coming months. If that legislation goes down – despite Republican majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican sitting in the White House for the first time in eight years – that could set off a ripple effect that sets back the rest of the agenda, beginning with trillions of dollars of new tax cuts long advocated by Trump and Ryan.\n\nTrump and Ryan have both devised detailed descriptions of what they want to achieve. And while they are not identical, both approaches would provide massive tax cuts for individuals and businesses – especially for the wealthiest Americans -- and contribute substantially to the long-term debt absent real offsetting cuts and savings.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\n“This is so basic to what we’ve promised over the last few elections,” Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), the majority whip, said of the health-care legislation in an interview with Bloomberg. “I think if we fail to keep this promise then I think it makes the rest of our work much, much more difficult to accomplish.”\n\nStan Collender, a Washington budget expert, said in in an interview yesterday, “It would be much better for Trump and congressional Republicans to win first on ACA repeal and replace and create some seeming political inevitability to tax reform.”\n\n“All those who hope for tax reform shouldn’t abandon ship,” he added. “But just know that there will be some opponents of the leadership and the Trump White House that are going to feel that if they beat them once, they can beat them a second time.”\n\nRyan and President Trump have been frantically engaged in a series of behind the scenes negotiations with Republican conservatives and moderates to salvage the House GOP’s American Health Care Act before the first big scheduled vote on the House floor on Thursday.\n\nTrump sought to rally House Republicans during a Tuesday morning appearance on Capitol Hill. He warned the lawmakers that they could lose their seats and the Republican majority in the 2018 mid-term election if they fail to deliver on their pledge to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Cuts to Medical Research May Not Get Past Congress\n\nTrump singled out Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), chair of the arch conservative House Freedom Caucus, for a special warning. The blustery, hard-charging Trump suggested that he might even campaign against him if the Republicans fail to pass new health care legislation in the House and Senate.\n\nYet Meadows, one of the sharpest critics of the House GOP health plan, was unfazed by the threat – one that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later dismissed as a joke by the president. Meadows was asked by reporters whether there were at least 21 Freedom Caucus members opposed to the legislation – or just one less than the number of Republicans it would take to stop the bill, assuming all Democrats vote against it. He replied “yes,” according to The Hill.\n\nEven if Trump and Ryan manage to squeeze out a bare majority for the bill by knocking heads and offering last-minute concessions, the political terrain in the Senate is far more hostile to the legislation. Critics on both sides of the aisle are worried about rising premium costs, inadequate subsidies, the loss of coverage for millions of their constituents and uncertainty over the fate of Medicaid for the poor.\n\nAn unholy alliance of conservatives including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah and more moderate senators including Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska may all stand in the way of the bill even making it to the floor for a vote next month.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nThe GOP fiscal and budget agenda has been so closely intertwined this year that something like the defeat of the AHCA would have a falling dominoes effect on everything else. For example, the Republican health care replacement plan includes the repeal of more than $800 billion of Obamacare tax hikes, with the lost revenue offset by corresponding cuts in Medicaid spending.\n\nThose long-term revenue reductions will be needed by the Republicans later this year in devising a “revenue neutral” tax cut plan that meets the special budget reconciliation rules that bar actions that result in a net increase in the deficit. Those special rules will be essential to the Republicans in passing the tax package with a simple 51 vote margin in the Senate, instead of the usual 60-vote super majority needed to get just about anything done in the Upper Chamber.\n\nRyan recently raised the possibility that the tax cut package would also be used as the vehicle for raising the debt ceiling to avoid a first-ever default on the U.S. debt this fall If the tax cut is delayed – or even put off until next year – the GOP leadership would have to find some other legislative vehicle to carry the unpopular debt ceiling increase.\n\nThere are other highly important fiscal and budgetary chores to be dealt with this year that could be temporarily sidetracked or adversely impacted because of lost momentum. For one thing, Congress has yet to finish work on this year’s fiscal 2017 spending package that runs through Sept. 30. That process has been complicated by Trump’s new budget plan unveiled last week, that seeks additional military spending this year above the existing cap.\n\nRelated: Budget Group Says Changes to AHCA Negate Half of Deficit Savings\n\nAnd there is likely to be a big fight over Trump’s call for construction of a $25 billion security wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nTrump was expected to show extraordinary mojo and clout in pushing through GOP programs this year. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) both feared and applauded Trump’s political clout and communications skills coming off the 2016 campaign. They sought to harness that power in pushing through their agenda.\n\nBut Trump may be losing his influence just when he and his party need it most. Trump’s erratic behavior with lawmakers and foreign leaders alike have raised concerns about his governing style and frequent self-inflicted political wounds. Now he is facing arguably the biggest crisis of his young presidency.\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department this week revealed an ongoing federal investigation into whether Trump’s campaign advisers colluded with the Russians who hacked into Democratic National Committee emails as part of an effort to influence the outcome of the 2016 election and help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nMoreover, FBI director James Comey and other top intelligence officials have now confirmed that Trump lied two weeks ago in claiming on his Twitter account that former President Obama wire tapped Trump Tower during the campaign."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/22/3-Reasons-Pentagon-Worried-About-Global-Warming",
    "text": "While the Trump administration may be rife with climate-change skeptics such as Scott Pruitt, the new chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump’s Pentagon is taking global warming seriously.\n\nIn an update to a previous story, the investigative website ProPublica last week published new excerpts from written exchanges between Defense Secretary James Mattis and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he said: “I agree that the effects of a changing climate — such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others — impact our security situation.”\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Is Going Green, With or Without Trump\n\nThis week, Military Times laid out some of the things taking place right now in the world that give Mattis and the Pentagon reason to worry:\n\n1. The Arctic thaw. As ice caps at the top of the world melt, nations will compete for resources in the region. The Arctic is also a strategic site for anti-missile defenses, and Russia is well ahead of the U.S. there. “Its military has established a new Arctic command, added four brigades, 14 airfields, 16 ports, and has 40 operational icebreakers and 11 in production,” Military Times says. “The U.S. has only one working icebreaker, and it was commissioned in the 1970s.”\n\nIn addition, there are worries that warming waters in the Artic will cause fish to migrate north, raising the chance of conflict over the fishing trade. One notable potential flash point is the South China Sea, where tensions are already high between China and Vietnam.\n\n2. Rising sea levels and droughts. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that “Many military bases along the US East Coast and Gulf of Mexico are at risk of permanently losing land to the ocean in the decades ahead.” The study last summer said that “A roughly three-foot increase in sea level would threaten 128 coastal DOD [Department of Defense] installations in the United States (43 percent of which are naval installations, valued at roughly $100 billion).” Among the at-risk installations cited were the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; the Marines’ Camp Lejeune in North Carolina; and the naval shipyard in Portsmouth, Maine.\n\n\n\nMilitary Times also pointed to the 2014 wildfire at a naval facility near the Marines’ Camp Pendleton in Southern California as an example of the devastation that droughts can cause.\n\n\n\n3. Refugees. Numerous mass migrations are already taking place around the world caused by war, economic conditions or other factors. Climate change could further disrupt unstable regions.\n\nProPublica said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) asked Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, the following: “I understand that while you were commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command you signed off on a document called the Joint Operating Environment, which listed climate change as one of the security threats the military will face in the next quarter-century. Do you believe climate change is a security threat?”\n\nMattis replied, “Climate change can be a driver of instability and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/22/Has-Trump-Hit-Wall-Over-GOP-Health-Care-Bill",
    "text": "One big take-away from James Comey’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee is that the FBI is investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The other? That Americans no longer trust America’s political leaders or intelligence organizations. As the FBI Director answered questions about Russia’s interference in our election and President Trump’s claims that he was wiretapped by President Obama, angry viewers across the political spectrum vented on Twitter and Facebook, charging Comey with lying and retracing the unresolved arguments of last year’s campaign.\n\nFor instance: “Hey Comey, Trump Doesn’t Know Putin, but Hillary Sold the Russians Uranium for millions. She is the real Friend of Putin.” Or, “The #ComeyHearing was a game-changer in how 2016 is perceived. Had the fact below been known, Hillary would likely be president.” Not much listening; minds made up.\n\nRelated: Trump Tries to Turn Up the Heat on Sanctuary Cities\n\nThose on the right doubt there is “no evidence” that the Obama White House conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign. They point to The New York Times’ piece on January 20 claiming that “American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Trump….”\n\nThat story ran with this headline: “Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides.” Given Donald Trump’s propensity for sloppiness, many supporters interpret his accusations as based on this report of eavesdropping and surveillance. Note: The original headline appeared only in the print edition of The New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary supporters can’t imagine there’s “no evidence” of collusion, as any number of intelligence chiefs have claimed, between people in Donald Trump’s camp and Moscow. After all, there are numerous reported links between Russians and various people circling Trump Tower, and several instances of people like Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemingly lying about those contacts.\n\nSadly, neither side of the political spectrum believes FBI Director James Comey, and neither right nor left is confident in the integrity of the Congressional committee conducting the inquiry. As one person tweeted: “This will be marked in American history as a sad period of time where the NSA, FBI and CIA simply can no longer be trusted.” This is a disaster for our country.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nBaby Boomers learned to be skeptical of our elected officials early on when they listened to preposterous and false accounts of victories during the Vietnam War. So outlandish were the nightly claims of progress by our leaders – thousands of the enemy killed each night while all our troops were safe and sound – that they and those promulgating them in the major news networks became objects of ridicule.\n\nBut what about young people, a majority of whom, we are told, don’t think Donald Trump is the legitimate president? How did they become so cynical?\n\nThe exposed lies of recent years – revelations that have often come through email hacks or WikiLeaks – hasn’t helped. Finding that the Bush administration misled the public about WMD in Iraq or that James Clapper lied about widespread NSA spying or that iPhones aren’t secure or that the DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders or that you can’t really keep your doctor – these discoveries, and the fact that last year’s campaign featured two candidates with record low trustworthiness, have soured millennials. You can’t blame them.\n\nAmerica is hurting, divided and angry. This is not “fake news”; the polarization in Congress is real, as is the consequent inability to come together and solve our nation’s challenges. The media is part of the problem. A recent CBS News poll indicated that 60 percent of the country views the mainstream news media as inaccurate. Not just wrong-headed, but wrong. That’s new.\n\nRelated: Consumer Confidence Is High, So Why Is Spending So Weak?\n\nDistrust of the mainstream media has driven millions of jaded Americans to Facebook and Twitter for information, exacerbating the problem. Clicking on such sites allows a retreat to our ideological comfort zones, reading only what we agree with and accepting only those facts that fit our perspective.\n\nSocial media is not only lopsided but full of misinformation. This is a serious issue; educators are so concerned about the impact of news gathered from social media sites that they are teaching sixth-graders in Coney Island how to distinguish “fake” news from the real thing. College students are being tutored on the topic as well. Merrimack College associate professor Melissa Zimdars compiled a list of “fake news sites”, which was then picked up and recommended to Harvard students as part of a library guide on “Fake News, Misinformation, and Propaganda.”\n\nThe only problem? The list included many right-leaning but respected conservative news organizations including The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and The Weekly Standard. Left-leaning groups like Salon or Vox were not included. Ms. Zimdars was immediately accused of generating – you guessed it - fake news, and took the list down.\n\nRelated: Glued to the TV, Apparently, Trump Fires a Tweet Into the Comey Hearing\n\nWhere do we go from here? President Trump needs to step up his game – he must set the tone and demand that others respond in kind. He must swear off issuing incredible charges and claims. He doesn’t need hyperbole; his message is strong and appeals to millions. He is new to public office, and as such not yet convinced that his every utterance will be taken at face value. It will, and he needs to rein in his asides and one-liners that he considers clever but that others use to eviscerate him. And he needs to curb the tweeting. A recent CBS survey showed that most damaging to his support today is not his healthcare bill or even his suspected ties to Russia; rather, it is his tweeting.\n\nAnd the media should declare a cease-fire. Of course, they should criticize Trump when appropriate, but more balanced coverage might lower the nation’s temperature. Last weekend the Financial Times wrote a favorable editorial commending President Trump for raising optimism and “animal spirits”; it was, perhaps, the first liberal newspaper to acknowledge any single positive outcome of Trump’s 50 days in office. A welcome start."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/21/Budget-Group-Says-Changes-AHCA-Negate-Half-Deficit-Savings",
    "text": "One of the few constituencies that wasn’t completely horrified by the Congressional Budget Office’s evaluation of the American Health Care Act last week was the loose collection of budget hawks in Washington. The bill, for all its faults, promised to reduce the federal deficit, if only modestly, over the coming decades.\n\nNow, though, as House leaders have begun making changes and concessions to buy the votes of Republican holdouts, they are paying the price for people who view major changes in federal health care policy through the lens of long-term fiscal stability.\n\nRelated: A Politically Damaged Trump Will Try to Rally GOP Behind AHCA\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that a rough analysis of two Manager’s Amendments to the bill, which began circulating Monday night and outlined various proposed changes, would slash the bill’s impact on the deficit by up to fifty percent.\n\n“As far as we can tell, these changes seem likely to cut the deficit reduction in the bill by roughly half over the next decade and even more over the second decade. Regarding coverage impact, it does not appear that these amendments by themselves would change the original bill's coverage impact much (at least without more details on the tax credit changes), but it seems likely that coverage would be further reduced due to the Medicaid changes.”\n\nThe changes include giving the Senate the ability to add $85 billion to the tax credits already proposed for Americans over 50 who are not yet eligible for Medicare. They would also give states the ability to decide between accepting block grant funding for Medicaid or per capita funding.\n\nThe changes would also impact the federal Treasury on the revenue side, by accelerating the elimination of taxes imposed under the Affordable Care Act, the legislation that AHCA is meant to repeal and replace.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\n“With these changes included, we roughly estimate that the amended version will reduce deficits by between $150 billion and $200 billion, as opposed to the $337 billion in the original bill,” CRFB wrote on Tuesday.\n\n“As we have noted previously, the relatively modest amount of deficit reduction in AHCA compared to the savings from ACA repeal and Medicaid reforms in previous balanced budget resolutions will make it harder for Congress to balance the budget. The changes in the manager's amendment make that task even harder.”\n\nThe CRFB analysis was the second awkward review of the GOP health care plan released Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Margot Sanger-Katz, of The New York Times pointed out that when CBO reports are compared, the enactment of the AHCA -- despite the claim that it is a “replacement” for the ACA -- would actually result in more people losing their health care than if Obamacare were simply repealed and not replaced at all."

    "text": "President Trump has long criticized cities and counties that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in detaining illegal immigrants for possible deportation.\n\nIn January, in a retaliatory move against cities including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Trump ordered cuts in potentially billions of dollars’ worth of Department of Justice, Homeland Security and other federal grants to those communities.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration turned up the heat with the release of a report listing law enforcement agencies and jurisdictions that have refused to detain jailed immigrants for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The report will be released weekly, as required by President Trump’s executive order signed January 25, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.”\n\nICE routinely places detainers on illegal immigrants who have been arrested on local criminal charges when there is probable cause for their deportation. During the first reporting period of Jan. 28 through Feb. 3, ICE issued 3,083 detainers to local authorities across the country, according to the report.\n\nAmong the non-cooperative jurisdictions were Clark County in the Las Vegas area, Nassau County outside of New York City, Cook County in the Chicago area, Montgomery County in Iowa and Snohomish County in Washington state. ICE provided the following list of the highest volume of detainers issued to non-cooperative jurisdictions between January 28, 2017 and February 3, 2017:\n\nSource: U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement\n\nThe final status of those detainers is not yet known. The list simply shows the largest number of detainers that were issued in the most recent reporting period in jurisdictions that have failed to cooperate with ICE in the past.\n\nOverall, 206 people nationwide were allowed to leave jail instead of being held for ICE. Of that total, 142 illegal immigrants -- or 69 percent of the total -- were from Travis County, Texas. The county adopted a policy on Feb. 1 that greatly restricted its cooperation with ICE agents in rounding up illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: Could Trump’s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?\n\nMaj. Wes Priddy of the Travis County Sheriff’s Office in Austin told The Washington Post that his office does detain criminals convicted of serious crimes for immigration officials but does not as a rule turn over people awaiting trial. According to the DHS list, charges pending against many of those who had been released ranged from burglary and marijuana possession to vehicle theft, sex offenses against minors and kidnapping.\n\nTrump has said that his tough immigration policies, which have reportedly triggered panic in Hispanic communities across the country, are largely targeted at detaining and deporting hardened criminals and gang members.\n\nOn Monday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement denouncing Travis County law enforcement officials over the findings of the DHS report. “Today’s report from DHS is deeply disturbing and highlights the urgent need for a statewide sanctuary city ban in Texas,” he said. “The Travis County Sheriff’s decision to deny ICE detainer requests and release back into our communities criminals charged with heinous crimes ... is dangerous and should be criminal in itself.”\n\nRelated: Some Sanctuary City Officials Will Stonewall Trump Over Deportations\n\nSome state and local officials, civils rights groups and immigrant advocacy organizations sharply criticized the release of the DHS report as a heavy-handed effort to intimidate law enforcement organizations and undermine undocumented aliens’ constitutional rights.\n\nCody Wofsy, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Projects, told The Washington Post that the release of the list “is part of an overall strategy to scare jurisdictions into becoming deportation agents.” He added that local jurisdictions have the legal right to refuse to get involved in the federal immigration system."

The House leadership’s American Health Care Act is politically toxic.

We made a promise and now’s the time to keep our promise.”\n\nCannon to right of them,\n\nCannon to left of them,\n\nCannon in front of them\n\nBut in demanding loyalty from the Republicans in the House, Trump and Ryan are asking them to expose themselves to harsh attacks from across the political spectrum.\n\nHard-right conservatives have dubbed AHCA it “Obamacare-lite” and cast it as an actual betrayal of that promise to undo the ACA because it keeps some of the existing law’s elements in place. They view the bill’s refundable tax credits for funding insurance premium payments as the creation of another entitlement program.\n\nRelated: Trump May Have Just Handed Conservatives a Loss on Obamacare Repeal\n\nAt the same time, moderates come at the bill from the left, dismayed by a Congressional Budget Office analysis that shows AHCA will cost 24 million Americans their health insurance over a decade while reducing care and increasing costs for the poor and elderly.\n\nFinally, even if they manage to hold together long enough to pass the legislation through the House, it will run smack into a Senate where their Republican colleagues have shown little enthusiasm for matching their sacrifice.\n\nO the wild charge they made!\n\nAll the world wondered.\n\nIn the end, there will be no poets memorializing the Obamacare-Lite Brigade’s assault on the Affordable Care Act.

    "text": "It might have been just a coincidence in the raging battle of threats and displays of military might in and around the Korean Peninsula. But the U.S. military may have sent North Korea a not-so-subtle message.\n\nOn Sunday, Pyongyang released a clumsily doctored video purporting to show the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in flames. The Vinson is central to the ongoing war games being conducted by U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK) forces, and its F-18 attack jets represent a serious threat to the North Korean military.\n\nRelated: Tillerson’s Asia Trip Could Signal the End US Soft Diplomacy\n\nThe annual exercises always elicit a fiery response from North Korea, but this year the reaction has been more radical than usual: On Mar. 6, the North fired four missiles whose threatened targets were said to be American military bases in Japan. They landed in the Sea of Japan, but some of the missiles came as close as 190 miles from the Japanese coast.\n\nThen on his first visit to Asia last week, new U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered some of the toughest talk about North Korea in recent years, going so far as to say that if Pyongyang does not give up its nuclear weapons, all options, including military strikes, are on the table.\n\n“Let me be very clear,” Tillerson said, “this policy of strategic patience has ended ... North Korea must understand that the only path to a secure, economically prosperous future is to abandon its development of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other weapons of mass destruction.”\n\nTillerson made that statement on Friday during his visit to South Korea. North Korea released the video two days later while Tillerson was in Beijing meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nRelated: Why Spending $1 Trillion a Year on Defense Won’t Make Us Safer\n\nBut if one intention of the video was to demonstrate how North Korea could disable the launch pad for American air strikes, the U.S. military signaled five days earlier that it doesn’t need a carrier for its latest fighter to be a threat.\n\nOn Mar. 14, an F-35B Lightning II attached to a Marine fighter attack squadron based in Iwakuni, Japan, was successfully refueled over the Pacific –- its first in-air refueling in that region. South Korea’s Yonhap News Service noted that the “refueling vastly extends the fighter jet's ability to stay in the air, enabling it to carry out key missions over the Korean Peninsula if the need arises.”\n\nCorrection: The story has been corrected. An earlier version stated that the USS Carl Vinson is equipped with F-35 aircraft, but the F-35 is not scheduled for deployment on U.S. aircraft carriers for several more years."

    "text": "With his public approval ratings at stunning lows and his White House reeling from Monday’s devastating revelation that the FBI is investigating possible collusion between his campaign staff and Russian intelligence agencies during the presidential election, President Trump today will try to convince wary House Republicans to rally behind him in support of a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nReuters reported that the president will address the House Republican Conference personally on Tuesday, in advance of a looming vote on the American Health Care Act, the controversial piece of legislation that GOP leadership is trying to gather enough support to pass.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Cuts to Medical Research May Not Get Past Congress\n\nIt would be a tall order even under ideal circumstances because this is a politically perilous vote for both conservative and moderate members of the GOP.\n\nAn analysis of the bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week found that, as written, it would reduce the number of Americans with health insurance by 14 million immediately and by 24 million over a decade. It would also raise costs and reduce service for vulnerable Americans, including the elderly and the poor. That combination of factors has left Republicans on the moderate end of the party’s spectrum reluctant to support the bill.\n\nAt the same time, the bill leaves in place some elements of the ACA and creates a new system of tax credits meant to help low-income Americans pay for health insurance on the private market. Those elements of the bill have led to a revolt among the party’s hard right members, who have labeled the legislation “Obamacare-lite” and say they will refuse to vote for it.\n\nThe result has been a spectacle of arm-twisting and glad-handing by House leadership and the White House over the past few days to bring enough Republicans on board -- 216 given the current make-up of the House -- to send the bill to the Senate.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nAnd all this is being done in the service of a piece of legislation that Republican members of the Senate have preemptively declared dead-on-arrival in the upper chamber. That means that House Republicans are being asked to take a politically damaging vote on a bill that may never even get voted on in the Senate, much less become law.\n\nUnder other circumstances, a newly-elected president might be able to rouse the members of his party to his support. Particularly with the GOP in control of both Congress and the White House, there is little upside for Republicans in allowing their president to take an embarrassing pratfall in his first major legislative effort.\n\nBut Trump will arrive on Capitol Hill Tuesday, two months into his presidency, dragging more political baggage than many presidents accumulate in a full four-year term.\n\nHe will be speaking just a day after his own Justice Department publicly repudiated him in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. FBI Director James Comey, making it clear that he was speaking as a representative of DOJ, said that there was no evidence for Trump’s repeated insistence that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of his offices during the presidential campaign. In the same hearing, Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, angrily denied another White House claim, alleging that Obama had pressed British intelligence services to surveil Trump.\n\nRelated: How the Trump Administration Can Undermine Obamacare If Repeal Fails\n\nComey also revealed that the FBI is investigating efforts by Russian intelligence services to disrupt the presidential campaign by stealing and releasing damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but that it is looking into whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin as part of that effort.\n\nWavering House members will, understandably, be asking themselves if they really want to take a political bullet for Trump at this stage.\n\nHouse leadership, late Monday, tried to soften the blow for various constituencies in their conference. According to Politico, which obtained a copy of an amended version of the legislation, multiple changes were made to try to appease dissatisfied lawmakers.\n\nAmong them:\n\n-- An $85 billion provision meant to cushion older Americans from sharply increased costs under the plan. The amended bill would instruct the Senate to restructure the tax credit scheme to make it more generous to older Americans.\n\nRelated:\n\n-- A measure to allow states to add a work requirement for Medicaid recipients.\n\n-- Allowing states to choose between a per-person cap on federal contributions to Medicaid, or a fixed-sum block grant offering more freedom in how Medicaid dollars are spent.\n\n-- Accelerated repeal of taxes imposed by the ACA.\n\n-- Closing of a loophole that might have made it possible for recipients of the tax credits to use that money to pay for abortions.\n\nRepublican leadership, in a move reminiscent of the infamous “Cornhusker kickback” that helped get the ACA passed, added language to the bill that applies only to the state of New York. It bars the state from seeking Medicaid reimbursement from rural counties in the state but allows it to continue taxing more metropolitan areas, like New York City.\n\nRelated: Ryan Says House GOP is ‘On Track’ to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA\n\nThe proposal, which has infuriated that state’s Democratic governor and representatives of urban districts, was added to the bill to appease a coterie of conservative upstate lawmakers who signaled Monday that it had, in effect, been sufficient to buy their votes.\n\nAs the House nears its planned vote on AHCA Thursday, though, it remains unclear whether the persuasive power of the president and the new changes to the law will be enough to drag the necessary 216 lawmakers over the line.\n\nLate Monday, some key conservatives in the House said that they will not support the bill even with the new changes. However, in a glimmer of hope for the White House, leaders of the House Freedom Caucus said that, while they do not support to bill themselves, they will not specifically direct their members to vote against it."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/21/How-Goldman-Sachs-Wins-and-You-Lose-Its-Mortgage-Crisis-Punishment",
    "text": "People are rightly concerned that numerous former Goldman Sachs executives have taken plum positions in the upper echelons of the Trump administration, making a mockery of the president’s populist campaign rhetoric. But we all know that Goldman’s friendly merger with government spans both political parties over a period of decades. In fact, the latest outrage involving Goldman dates back to the Obama administration.\n\nLast April, as part of its “settlements for everybody” approach to the housing bubble-era financial crime wave, Obama’s Justice Department reached agreement with Goldman Sachs to end investigation into the fraudulent sale of mortgage-backed securities. The bank lied to investors about the quality of the loans that comprised these securities, earning billions off the deception.\n\nRelated: How Democrats Can Un-Rig the Party and Start Winning Again\n\nThe Justice Department billed this as a “$5.1 billion settlement.” But that figure was incredibly misleading; at best the bank was giving DoJ a small cut of a decade of profits. There was a bigger problem, too: $1.8 billion of this settlement was earmarked for “consumer relief,” in which Goldman would write down the mortgages of struggling homeowners. But it didn’t own any home loans.\n\nSo Goldman went on a mortgage-buying spree, becoming the dominant customer for delinquent home loans from Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage holder. The bank has sucked up two-thirds of the $9.6 billion in loans Fannie Mae sold in the past year and a half, including $1.4 billion just last week. It has also purchased loans from other sellers, under the alias MTGLQ Investors (short for “mortgage liquidation”). And in no case was Goldman paying full price. In fact, it’s paid as low as 50 percent of the face value for the “non-performing” loans.\n\nDoing the math reveals the ridiculousness of the Justice Department calling this a punishment. Goldman Sachs buys a home loan at 50 percent off. It then modifies the mortgage for the borrower to perhaps 60 percent of face value. The modification gets referred to the overseer of the mortgage settlement, proving that Goldman did lower the cost for the homeowner. And as homeowners begin to make modified payments, the bank can resell the now-performing loans, or just take in the revenue stream. If this works, Goldman makes at least a 10 percent profit on the deal, while satisfying the consumer relief terms of the settlement.\n\nIn other words, the government sentenced Goldman Sachs to make money.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Case a Reminder Why Trump’s Attack on Dodd-Frank Is Dangerous\n\nNot only that, but if you think about who ends up paying the cost of the relief for the homeowner, it’s Fannie Mae, who sold the delinquent loans at a severe discount, with some of that going to the homeowner and a markup to Goldman Sachs. Under the current conservatorship, Fannie Mae remits all of its profits to the U.S. Treasury. So these losses are essentially borne on the backs of the government. If you’re asking who paid Goldman Sachs’ mortgage penalty, the answer is Uncle Sam.\n\nThis is already working well for Goldman. In February, Eric Green, the settlement monitor, announced that the bank has satisfied over $100 million of its penalty already, through various modifications on around 5,000 mortgages.\n\nI’ll stress that there’s nothing illegal going on. Goldman was told to deliver consumer relief and it’s doing it. The homeowners in these distressed mortgages are getting help. And if Goldman can achieve that while making money for its investors, bully for it. But this was supposed to be a penalty for committing fraud, not a business opportunity. And there’s no reason it couldn’t have been structured to force the actual offending bank to take the losses.\n\nWhat if, instead of Goldman Sachs administering consumer relief, it paid the $5 billion into a homeowner fund, which the government — through Fannie Mae or other agencies — then used to compensate troubled borrowers? This would have generated the exact same outcomes for homeowners, at Goldman’s expense.\n\nPolicymakers have been screaming for precisely this kind of compensation fund since the foreclosure crisis began nearly a decade ago. During the Great Depression, a government program called the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) bought up a million distressed mortgages, modified the loans to keep people in their homes, and by the time it ended in the early 1950s, turned a small profit.\n\nHOLC was a solid initiative that would have helped far more people than the government’s failed attempts at foreclosure mitigation. We didn’t need to leave this idea to proven rip-off artists running the same program as penance for misdeeds.\n\nAdditionally, when Goldman operates an HOLC-style scheme, the main interest is profits, not the public. The Wall Street Journal reports that the bank has often foreclosed on these mortgages, taking advantage of higher home prices to make money on the resale. In fact, if Goldman forgives secondary loans on the same property, it can foreclose and earn credit toward the settlement at the same time. Goldman’s bankers are obviously weighing which strategy will bring a higher return on a case-by-case basis. The interests of the actual homeowners living in these properties are of secondary concern.\n\nRelated: 10 Real Estate Trends to Watch in 2017\n\nThis nonsensical circumstance stems from an inability to hold any company or individual accountable for the mortgage disaster that triggered the Great Recession. The Obama administration stressed that speeding relief to needy families took precedence over a need for Biblical-style justice. But of course, there’s nothing speedy about a loan modification in 2017, a decade after the bubble collapsed. And if nobody at Goldman will pay a price anyway, the least Obama could have done is to take control of the process, minimizing collateral damage and ensuring that Goldman didn’t reward itself even more from the swindle.\n\nThe failure of accountability was a component in the rise of Trump, whose anti-establishment rhetoric masked a return to power for the same old Wall Street titans. Trump railed against Goldman Sachs and then put its executives in control. But Obama’s Justice Department “punished” Goldman Sachs by allowing it to profit off the same mortgage crisis it helped create. The more things change, the more they stay the same."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/21/GOP-Health-Plan-Reduces-Federal-Deficit-24-Trillion-Over-Two-Decades",
    "text": "The House GOP proposal for replacing the Affordable Care Act not surprisingly would save the government $337 billion over the coming decade—as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in a much-anticipated report last week.\n\nThe combination of eliminating the mandate for Americans to purchase health insurance, repealing tens of billions of Obamacare tax increases, and gradually slashing and downsizing Medicaid for the poor would result in 24 million fewer people enrolled in health insurance by 2026, the CBO reported.\n\nRelated: Trump May Have Just Handed Conservatives a Loss on Obamacare Repeal\n\nWhile the CBO analyzed the proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) through the prism of a ten-year budget window, a new analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the Republican plan – for all its many flaws – would reduce the federal deficit by a net $2.4 trillion over a 20-year period.\n\nThe admittedly “rough” calculations by the CRFB, a prominent anti-deficit research group, claimed the bill if enacted would save $2 trillion over the coming two decades, including $1.6 trillion between 2027 (where CBO leaves off) and 2036. Factoring in an estimated $400 billion of interest on the federal debt that the government would save through reduced spending, CRFB puts the total two-decade savings at $2.4 trillion.\n\nThe new findings should provide the Trump administration with something to crow about in backing the health care plan which is likely to be brought up for a vote on the House floor on Thursday. Trump and his Republican allies have been repeatedly pounded by CRFB, the Concord Coalition and other fiscal watchdog groups for promoting budget and tax policies likely to drive up the deficit by many trillions of dollars in the coming decade.\n\nMoreover, the House GOP Obamacare replacement plan which Trump says he backs “100 percent” has been roundly criticized by many conservatives as “Obamacare Lite” because it doesn’t move quickly enough to dismantle the most important mandates – especially the requirement that everyone purchase insurance or pay a penalty -- and the biggest tax increases on the wealthy and health care industry.\n\nRelated: Ryan Says House GOP is ‘On Track’ to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA\n\nThe GOP proposal would, among other things, replace the Obamacare subsidy system with a different set of refundable tax credits. Those credits would enable individuals earning up to $75,000 a year to qualify for premium subsidies – with older people receiving the largest credits because they typically have much larger heath costs.\n\nIt would also gradually phase out the expanded Medicaid program now being used by mostly childless adults in 31 states and the District of Columbia. And it would eventually transform Medicaid from an increasingly costly entitlement program for the poor to a much cheaper system of block grants or per capita payments to the states.\n\nThose changes in the law would mean huge savings for the federal government over time, but it would also mean shifting a hefty portion of their costs to state governments. In the coming years, state governments would have to either dig deep into their coffers to finance an ever-growing share of the cost or tighten eligibility and shrink the rolls.\n\nThe CBO report said the largest savings for Republicans would come from reductions in spending for Medicaid and from the elimination of the Obamacare subsidies for non-group health insurance. The largest costs incurred by the new GOP plan would come from repealing dozens of ACA tax increase that have generated huge sums of money for the health insurance program.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nThose taxes raise $800 billion annually and include an increase in the Hospital Insurance payroll tax rate for high-income taxpayers, a surtax on those taxpayers’ net investment income, and annual fees imposed on health insurers.\n\nThere are many factors that would contribute to the deficit reduction under the House GOP plan, according to the CRFB released Monday. First, the new savings are phased in throughout the first decade and grow in impact over time. Also, new spending on tax credits is likely to grow at a slower pace than the Obamacare tax credits if they were still operating.\n\nFinally, many costs of the GOP program, including a Patient and State Stability Fund and a delay in the imposition of the so-called “Cadillac tax” on high-end health insurance policies provided by businesses to their employees are temporary. So those don’t have any budgetary effects beyond the first ten years.\n\n“In other words, savings in the legislation would grow faster than the costs and from a higher starting point,” the report stated.\n\nHowever, there are serious caveats to all of this. There is no way of predicting how insurance coverage might change during the second decade, the report noted, and “the AHCA’s long-term savings could be significantly lower if various temporary policies were continued.”\n\nFor example, if the Cadillac tax were repealed beyond 2025, it could cost the Treasury more than $600 billion over 20 years. That alone would eliminate a huge chunk of deficit reduction."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/20/Glued-TV-Apparently-Trump-Fires-Tweet-Comey-Hearing",
    "text": "Throughout his presidential campaign and into his young presidency, President Donald Trump has been very effective at using social media, and particularly Twitter, to shape the news cycle and the prevailing narrative. But on Monday, as he or someone with access to the official @POTUS twitter handle appeared to live-Tweet a Congressional hearing on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, the strategy backfired.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee was hearing testimony from Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers on allegations that Russia-backed hackers released information stolen from email accounts associated with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had been selectively released information to harm her campaign.\n\nRelated: It’s Easy to See Where the Trump-Russia Investigation Is Headed\n\nIn a public report in January, the FBI, NSA and the other agencies that make up the Intelligence Community released their unanimous finding that Russia did interfere in the election to harm Clinton and help Trump. However, they explicitly noted in the report that they were making no assertions about the effort’s effectiveness, and said they hadn’t even investigated the impact of the Russian hacking on the election results in the first place.\n\nAt the time, Trump surrogates like White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway had no compunction about going on the Sunday talk shows and claiming the exact opposite -- that the intelligence agencies had said Russian interference had no impact on the election result.\n\nAt the time, there was no significant pushback in real time, and those false claims went largely unchallenged. But that changed when the White House tried it again on Monday. Early in the hearing, Comey again said that the intelligence agencies’ investigation had made no determination at all about the effect of the Russians’ activities on the outcome of the election.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nAs the hearing was ongoing, the @POTUS account tweeted the following:\n\nThe NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5 — President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017\n\nThe link in the tweet leads to a clip of Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes asking Admiral Rogers if Russia had been able to change actual vote tallies in a number of swing states in November -- something none of the intelligence agencies in the US has ever suggested. But the broader implication of the tweet was clear: Trump was asserting that the intelligence community had determined that the Russian hacking had no impact on the election’s outcome.\n\nA staff member must have called the tweet to the attention of committee member Jim Himes of Connecticut because late in the hearing he raised it directly with Comey and Rogers.\n\n“Gentlemen in my original questions to you I asked you whether the intelligence community had undertaken any sort of study to determine whether Russian interference had had any influence on the electoral process and I think you told me the answer was no.”\n\n“Correct,” Rogers said. “We said the U.S. Intelligence community does not do analysis or reporting on the U.S. Political process or U.S. Public opinion. That is not our policy.”\n\nRelated: Here’s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\n“Okay,” said Himes. “Thanks to the modern technology that's in front of me right here, I've got a tweet from the president an hour ago saying the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process. That's not quite accurate, that tweet?”\n\nClearly surprised at being asked to correct the President of the United States in real time, Comey hesitated. Himes read the tweet back, and the FBI director said, “Let me tell you what we understand the state of what we've said is. We've offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it's never something we looked at.”\n\n“So it's not too far of a logical leap to conclude that the assertion that you have told the congress that there was no influence on the electoral process is not quite right?” Himes pressed.\n\n“Right,” said Comey. “It certainly wasn't our intention to say that today. We don't have any information on that subject. That's not something that was looked at.”\n\nPeople frustrated by a White House that often seems to regard the truth as a matter of opinion might rightly have seen immediate pushback from senior intelligence officials as a victory on Monday. But in the end, it might have been a Pyrrhic one. Trump’s tweet, wrong though it was, had tens of thousands of likes, comments and retweets by Monday afternoon. By the time Comey rubbished it, in the fifth hour of the hearing, the live broadcast of the event had been relegated to C-Span 3."

    "text": "As negotiations over the Republicans’ Obamacare replacement plan come down to the crunch, President Trump appears to be slamming the door on some last-minute conservative demands for fear of driving away moderate backing.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute, said on Monday that “everything about the bill is problematic” from a political and practical standpoint, and that Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) must thread a needle in devising compromises to placate all sides in the controversy.\n\nRelated: Ryan Says House GOP is ‘On Track’ to Repeal Obamacare and Pass the ACHA\n\nWith a vote on the GOP’s American Health Care Act looming on the House floor as early as Thursday, the White House notified three prominent conservatives senators over the weekend that they likely won’t get some of the changes they have been seeking, including an accelerated schedule for phasing out expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia and efforts to eliminate red tape for the insurance industry.\n\nThe proposal to speed up the time table for phasing out Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act from early 2020 to late 2018 has been sought by members of the arch conservative House Freedom Caucus and prominent Republican senators including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah to make good on the GOP campaign pledge to dismantle Obamacare and further reduce spending on health care.\n\nBut moderate Republicans in both chambers and some GOP governors whose states have benefited from the additional health care coverage for 11 million mostly childless, able-bodied low-income adults are threatening to torpedo the proposed replacement legislation if conservatives prevail in their demand.\n\nTotal Medicaid spending increased by 11.6 percent in FY 2015, rising to $556 billion. Most of the growth was the result of an increase in federal spending, which rose by 16.0 percent and is a direct result of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. In comparison, overall state spending on Medicaid increased by only 4.7 percent.\n\nLast month, four Republican senators with states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare – including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – signed a letter saying they couldn’t support the House GOP bill because it won’t protect people enrolled in the health care entitlement.\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nPolitico reported yesterday that during a meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday, several of the president’s top advisers including Steve Bannon told Cruz, Lee and House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows (R-NC) that it was increasingly apparent that the replacement plan would fail in the Senate with the accelerated Medicaid phase-out provision attached to it.\n\nCruz told Politico last week, “We can fix [the legislation] by meaningful Medicaid reform in particular: Freezing Medicaid expansion immediately, not holding open expansion for three more years to allow states to put yet more healthy childless adults onto an already overburdened Medicaid system.”\n\nAntos said that the idea of a quick phase-out of the expanded Medicaid program was highly impractical – as well as politically infeasible – because states participating in the program had to pass conforming legislation or other regulatory action to take part. If the much shorter phase-out deadline were enacted, Antos said, “I don’t think the states would be able to realign their programs in time.”\n\nMany moderates are also alarmed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast that as many approximately 14 million people would opt out of insurance because the mandate would be eliminated and another 10 million would lose their health insurance over the coming decade if Medicaid expansion was ended or curtailed.\n\nRelated: Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need\n\nIn replacing the Obamacare tax subsidies, the Republican plan would provide fixed credits to individuals making up to $75,000 a year and families making $150,000 a year, with older people receiving higher credits than younger people because their medical costs typically are much higher.\n\nHowever, the CBO analysis showed that while the House GOP bill would bring down overall premiums on individuals in the private market by about 10 percent by 2026, older people would end up paying far more for their premiums than younger Americans. For example, a 64-year-old person who would pay $1,700 in average premiums under Obamacare would see premiums skyrocket to $14,600 a year under the GOP plan – a 750 percent increase. By contrast, a 21-year-old who pays about $1,700 under Obamacare would pay only $1,450 under the GOP approach.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, a prominent moderate who has been highly critical of the GOP plan, said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press, “We have to do something about the fact that the House bill disproportionately affects older, rural Americans” while wiping out coverage for millions of Americans across the board.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said yesterday that he is pushing for an increase in the tax credits to help older people 50 to 60 years of age to purchase insurance and to allay the concerns of moderate Republicans.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nConservative are likely to have their way on several other matters, including imposing work requirement on able-bodied childless adults receiving benefits under expanded Medicaid and allowing states to choose between two alternatives to continuing to treat Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement program.\n\nStates would be allowed to opt for a per-capita payment for Medicaid beneficiaries in their states with a cost of living adjustment or a fixed “block grant” that they could use to cover much of their annual Medicaid costs but have more flexibility in setting eligibility rules. The average annual cost per capita of a Medicare beneficiary in 2016 was $6,502, although some states are much higher. New York averages $8,910 per beneficiary; Rhode Island, $8,229; New Jersey, $8,309; and Florida $8,887, to name a few.\n\nThe House Budget Committee approved both measures last week and they are almost certain to be part of a package of amendments attached to the GOP replacement plan when it is brought to the floor late this week.\n\nHowever, many conservatives complain that the House GOP approach doesn’t move quickly enough to repeal all the Obamacare mandates and taxes and the expanded Medicaid program. “The problem is, see, we as conservatives ran on repeal of Obamacare,” Rand Paul said yesterday on ABC’s This Week. “I was elected in 2010, right after it came into place, to repeal it. We never ran on a replacement of Obamacare Lite. We never ran on making the entitlement subsidies permanent. We never ran on an individual mandate or keeping the taxes or keeping the Medicaid expansion. We ran on repealing Obamacare because it doesn't work.”\n\nTrump predicted late last week that the House would approve the GOP plan and he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that efforts to line up support for the bill are “going well.” The president plans to meet with Republican lawmakers at the Capitol on Tuesday to make a final pitch for support, with the outcome of the vote still up in the air."

But it was evident within the first few hours of the testimony from National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey that there are two very separate directions members of Congress would like to see it move in.\n\nNot surprisingly, the direction any given member prefers is closely correlated to the side of the aisle on which he or she sits.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nThe two initial headlines out of the hearing both came early, in statements from Comey. He confirmed the widely reported fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice as a whole has no information to support President Trump’s claim, made on Twitter earlier this month, that former President Obama personally ordered that Trump’s phones be tapped during the presidential election.\n\nNot only did Comey say there was no information to support the claim, but both he and Rogers said that, given the system in place for authorizing domestic surveillance activities, the president did not have the authority to give such an order.\n\n“So, President Obama could not unilaterally order a wiretap?” asked Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee’s ranking Democrat.\n\n“No president could,” Comey said.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nRogers also angrily shot down the suggestion repeated by the White House that President Obama had used the British intelligence services to spy on Trump, saying such a move would be “expressly against” a longstanding intelligence-sharing arrangement between the US and its closest allies.\n\nComey also took the unusual step of confirming that there is an ongoing investigation into not just the involvement of Russian agents efforts to disrupt the presidential election by stealing and disseminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but that the agency is also investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nThe FBI’s effort, he said in his opening statement, “includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”\n\nWith the two biggest bits of news out of the way, the next step was for the members of the committee to react to them, and they did so in notably different ways.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nFrom the outset of the hearing, Republicans on the panel were laser-focused on the fact that information about the investigation into Russian meddling in the election -- particularly information that seems to have been derived from classified sources -- was leaked to the media. They repeatedly stressed the need to investigate and prosecute individuals who leaked information to the press, and gravely warned that the leaks might endanger the renewal of a specific law giving agencies like the NSA the ability to monitor the communications of non-U.S. persons overseas.\n\nA subject that repeatedly came up was the media reports, citing intelligence community sources, that revealed that former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had held undisclosed telephone conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump’s inauguration, in which he discussed the sensitive issue of US sanctions on Moscow.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, like South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, pressed Rogers on the question of who would have the authority to “unmask” the identity of a US person caught up incidentally in the surveillance of a foreign agent. Gowdy made a point of naming several former members of the Obama White House who might have had such authority, insinuating that the information might have come from the former president’s closest advisers.\n\nSuch surveillance is supposed to take place only under very closely controlled circumstances, with the results held in the strictest secrecy. Several GOP members of the panel warned the witnesses that the apparent breach of that secrecy could make it more difficult for lawmakers to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which authorizes the collection of the communications of non-US persons located outside the United States.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wire Tap Accusation\n\nBoth Comey and Rogers, at different times, felt the need to clarify to lawmakers that the intelligence being discussed during the hearing, the release of which the Republicans found so troubling, was not actually collected under the agencies’ Section 702 authority in the first place.\n\nFor their part, the Democrats showed little interest in the way information about contacts between members of Trump’s inner circle and Russian officials had gone public, focusing instead on what the existence of those connections might say about the influence Moscow had or may still have over the current president.\n\nTheir questions on that subject, though, went largely unanswered. Comey in particular, though he had been authorized to reveal the existence of an investigation into Russian involvement in the election and of possible coordination with the Trump campaign, was reluctant to expand on it any further.\n\nComey was particularly reticent when Schiff, the panel’s top Democrat, laid out a litany of known and suspected contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, repeatedly declining to address questions about individuals.\n\nRelated: Competing Narratives in Trump ‘Wiretap’ Story Lack Facts\n\nThe separate focus of the two parties when it comes to this investigation is likely to be pronounced in future hearings, perhaps as soon as next week, when the Intelligence Committee hopes to hear testimony from other former senior intelligence community figures.\n\nAnd if Republicans show any sign of wavering, they’ll likely receive some Twitter-fueled encouragement from the president. Indeed, Trump was angrily tweeting in advance of the hearing Monday morning, at one point insisting that, despite the unanimous view of the intelligence community that Russia intervened on his behalf, that the whole thing was actually a set up by the Democrats.\n\n“The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign,” the president claimed."

    "text": "The nation’s scientific research community hit the panic button last week after the Trump administration targeted the National Institutes of Health – the nation’s premier biomedical research organization -- for a budget cut of as much as 20 percent.\n\nThe proposed $5.8 billion reductions in NIH funding for grants and aid was contained in the fiscal 2018 budget blueprint President Trump submitted to Congress on Thursday, which seeks devastatingly deep cuts in many federal agencies and programs. More than 80 percent of NIH’s funding is awarded through nearly 50,000 competitive grants to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nRelated: Trump’s NIH Budget Cuts Threaten a Serious Setback in Medical Research\n\n“Drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget run counter to the priorities of our nation, national security, and the aspirations of Americans,” Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research! America, a non-profit research and public advocacy group, said in a statement.\n\nBut it looks as if House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) just gave the NIH a reprieve from the Trumpian budget ax. In an appearance yesterday on Fox News Sunday, Ryan stressed that Trump’s budget plan was merely the opening gambit and that Congress will have the final say in where the cuts will be made.\n\nWhile a major boost in defense spending is an important priority, said Ryan, a former House Budget Committee chair, “I will say that NIH is something that is particularly popular in Congress.”\n\nRyan noted that Congress last December overwhelmingly passed the CURE Act, sweeping legislation that boosts funding for medical research, expedites approval of experimental treatments for cancer patients, and reforms policy on mental health care.\n\nThat legislation authorizes $4.8 billion in new funding for NIH. Of that total, $1.8 billion was earmarked for the “cancer moonshot” initiated by former Vice President Joe Biden to speed up cancer research.\n\n“We really think we’re kind of getting close to some breakthrough discoveries on cancer and other diseases,” Ryan said yesterday in discussing Trump’s proposed cut in NIH spending. “So that’s something that I think in Congress you will see some changes.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/20/Why-Spending-1-Trillion-Year-Defense-Won-t-Make-Us-Safer",
    "text": "President Trump, Congressional Republicans and Congressional Democrats don’t agree on much, but they’re mostly united in the belief that we should spend tens of billions of additional dollars on defense. It is less clear that threats the U.S. faces justify the extra funding or that bureaucrats can spend the new money effectively.\n\nAlthough just about everyone agrees that defense spending should go up, the details are up for debate. The Trump administration has proposed to spend $603 billion on defense in 2018, which is $54 billion above the sequestration caps set during the 2011 budget compromise. Republican hawks led by Sen. John McCain say that the administration number is insufficient. They want to see a $640 billion military budget. On the Democratic side, Sen. Dick Durbin indicated support for Trump’s number so long as Republicans agree to also break the sequester caps on domestic spending (highly unlikely).\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe final number, which will be somewhere between $603 billion and $640 billion, is huge — but is only part of what the U.S. government spends to counter foreign rivals. Each year, Congress also appropriates money to Overseas Contingency Operations — a slush fund created for emergency security spending created in the wake of 9/11. In fiscal 2016, Congress authorized $58.6 billion in defense-related OCO spending. Trump proposes to raise this amount to $65 billion in 2018. This means we are looking at total military spending approaching $700 billion, or about 3.5 percent of next year’s nominal GDP.\n\nIt doesn’t end there. The skinny budget does not include money for the National Intelligence Program, which funds the CIA, NSA and other spying agencies, but for 2017 these agencies requested a total of $53.5 billion. Also excluded from reported defense spending totals is the Department of Veterans Affairs, which addresses the human consequences of our past deployments. The VA would see its discretionary funding raised from $74.5 billion this year to $78.9 billion next year under Trump’s budget blueprint, a 6 percent increase. That’s on top of mandatory spending of more than $100 billion this year. In total, the VA budget has nearly doubled since 2009 and looks likely to escalate further under the new administration.\n\nSo, all told, our nation’s defense establishment can be expected to cost us over $900 billion annually during the Trump years — closer to 4.5 percent of GDP.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nPolitical leaders justify the military buildup by citing a list of threats that typically include Russia, China and Islamic terrorism. But none of these threats approach the severity of that posed by the Communist bloc during the Cold War, when all of Eastern Europe was under the control of a hostile power. Yet, in real dollars, proposed defense spending exceeds the annual military budget at the height of the Cold War.\n\nToday, Russia is a mere shadow of the former Soviet Union, with a stagnant population less than half the size of ours and an economy that is about one twelfth of ours in nominal GDP terms. Yet the media is full of scare stories about the power and ruthlessness of Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nThe simple fact that Putin is a bad guy does not make the case for a defense buildup. It only makes sense to spend money to counter Russia if Putin is really a threat to us. Admittedly, Russia has enough nuclear weapons to kill everyone on the planet many times over. But there is every reason to believe that Putin, like all of his Soviet and Russian predecessors since World War II, is deterred from using his nuclear arsenal by the existence of our nuclear arsenal.\n\nSo we don’t need to send billions more to the Pentagon to avoid a Russian attack on U.S. territory. The more plausible concern is that, without a strong counterforce, Putin will continue to grab territory from adjacent states as he did with Georgia in 2008 and more recently in Ukraine. But these situations are half a world away and have virtually no impact on our economy. From the perspective of Trump’s “forgotten men” — the laid-off coal miners and manufacturing workers in the nation’s heartland — events on the periphery of Russia’s borders might as well be happening on Mars.\n\nChina is a more plausible economic rival but that nation has no history of global expansionism. As with Russia’s border incursions, China’s aggressive claims in the South China Sea are of little consequence to the average American.\n\nRelated: Tillerson’s Asia Trip Could Signal the End US Soft Diplomacy\n\nISIS, al Qaeda and other radical Islamist groups have expressed designs on American civilians and have inspired lone wolf attacks on the homeland in recent years, but they have been unable to repeat the spectacular attacks of 9/11. These groups are small — with total forces numbering in the tens of thousands — and are constantly weakened by their reliance on suicide attacks. Also, they are almost universally reviled; many other countries are fighting them or are willing to do so. As Trump has repeatedly suggested, Russia could be an ally in cost-effectively fighting radical Islam.\n\nThe rest of the U.S. establishment seems bent on stopping such cooperation. Democrats and their mainstream media allies, eager to undercut Trump’s legitimacy, continue to play up his campaign’s links to Russia. To accentuate the issue, they demonize Putin and exaggerate the impact of Russian propaganda. Republican hawks like McCain and Sen. Lindsay Graham, who see every foreign policy issue through the prism of the late 1930s (when the Nazis gobbled up Europe while Chamberlain appeased and the Americans slept), can’t fathom the idea of cooperating with the Russian strongman for any reason whatsoever.\n\nDue to this intransigence and political backbiting, we are obliged to fight Islamic terrorism largely on our own. Yet, given the small and decentralized nature of this threat, it is best countered by law enforcement and relatively inexpensive special forces; our heavy weapons and most of our 1.4 million Army, Navy and Air Force personnel are largely irrelevant.\n\nRelated: F-35s and Navy SEALs: Trump’s Powerful Warning to North Korea\n\nGiven all that, it is hard to see how billions more for defense will benefit the typical American not employed by a weapons contractor. But even for those who believe the opposite, there is a second question: Can the Department of Defense use the new money effectively? Evidence from years of oversight suggests not.\n\nDOD has serious financial management issues. Unlike other federal agencies, it is unable to produce financial statements that can pass an external audit. Indeed, for fiscal 2016, it has yet to provide any financial statements at all. DOD’s financial management issues have been on the General Accounting Office’s high risk list since 1995.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times has previously reported, DOD was unable to account for billions of dollars it spent in both Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, DOD’s Inspector General found that the U.S. Army made $6.5 billion in unsupported year-end adjustments to close its books in 2015.\n\nRelated: The Navy’s $35 Million Scandal: Hookers, Booze and a Guy Named ‘Fat Leonard’\n\nSo even if the DOD really needs new money to better counter external threats, there is little assurance that it will spend that new money wisely. Republicans often criticize Democrats for throwing money at dubious government programs irrespective of necessity or results, but the GOP’s approach to military spending reveals their hypocrisy. Republican warnings about budget deficits, unsustainable entitlements and government waste ring hollow when it is obvious that they are willing to lavish billions more on the military-industrial complex without insisting on accountability or even a compelling case in terms of cost and benefit."

    "text": "With his reputation on the line as the leading proponent of GOP health care reform, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Sunday predicted victory in the first big test of the GOP’s Obamacare replacement legislation this week.\n\n“We feel like we’re on track and we’re right where we want to be,” Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. “I feel very good about it actually. I feel like it’s exactly where we want to be.”\n\nRelated: With Medicaid Costs Soaring, Republicans Plan Dramatic Eligibility Changes\n\nRyan and President Trump have been scrambling for days to try to salvage the House GOP plan to replace Obamacare with a more conservative, market-oriented approach and the gradual phasing out of expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nWhile proponents say the GOP plan would eventually provide Americans with access to less expensive, more patient and doctor-centric coverage, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that 24 million people would lose voluntarily decline coverage under that approach by 2026 and that the replacement coverage would be more expensive in the short run – especially for older and low-income people.\n\nWith their party sorely divided between conservatives who complain the plan doesn’t go far enough to dismantle Obamacare's mandates and tax increases and moderates fretting the loss of expanded Medicaid coverage for millions of their constituents, passing the American Health Care Act will be problematic.\n\nRyan at one point said that his party faced the “binary choice” of backing the GOP replacement plan that he and his lieutenants crafted or sticking with an Obamacare health insurance system that was fast collapsing of its own weight and driving up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nRelated: Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need\n\nHowever, Trump and other White House advisers concluded that some changes would be necessary to quell the revolt by conservatives and placate some moderates and Republican governors.\n\nNow it appears that the House will take up a series of amendments to the original plan when the bill hits the floor this week, probably on Thursday. Those amendments include imposing a work requirement on many able-bodied adult Medicaid beneficiaries, retooling the plan’s refundable tax credit subsidies to provide greater assistance to older and low-income people, and granting states the option of receiving federal Medicaid funding in the future through a block grant program giving them more flexibility in how they spend the money and determine eligibility rules.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nToday Ryan insisted that he always had been open to changes to his bill and that his members will finally face that “binary choice” on Thursday when the legislation and a package of “manager’s amendments” are brought to the House floor for a vote.\n\n“The reason I feel so good about this is because the president has become a great closer,” Ryan told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. “He’s the one who has helped to negotiate changes to this bill with members from all over our caucus. We’re still having conversations with our members, we’re making fine-tuning improvements to the bill to reflect people’s concerns, to reflect people’s improvements.”\n\n“I’m very impressed with how the president is helping us close this bill, making the improvements that we’ve been making, getting the votes, so we feel very good where we are,” he added.\n\nTrump was upbeat about the bill’s prospects for passage during a joint press conference on Friday afternoon at the White House with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He boasted that earlier in the day he had persuaded a dozen conservative House members to back the bill and that it is “going to be passed.”\n\n“It’s coming together beautifully,” Trump said. “We have conservative groups, other groups, everybody wants certain things.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nHowever, three conservative Republican senators – Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas -- all insisted today that the House GOP plan is hopelessly flawed and will not pass through Congress as currently drafted.\n\n“I think there are enough conservatives that do not want Obamacare Lite,” Paul said on ABC’s This Week. “None of us ran on this plan. We ran on repealing Obamacare because it doesn’t work.”\n\nCruz said during an appearance on the CBS’s Face the Nation that the House bill falls far short of repealing all the Obamacare mandates and taxes, and that “it doesn’t fix the problem” of rising premiums and overall costs to consumers. Cotton agreed with Cruz during an interview on CNN that the House bill will not bring down premiums for people seeking coverage in the private health insurance market.\n\n“I simply think that it’s not going to work to bring down premiums for working Arkansans and working Americans all across the country,” Cotton said. “It’s fixable, but it’s going to take a lot of work, and we need to roll up our sleeves and focus on fixing those problems rather than trying to rush to some arbitrary deadline.”"

    "text": "Since the Korean War ended with an armistice almost 65 years ago, relations between the U.S. and North Korea have often been on a scary roller-coaster ride -- another military confrontation always in the offing.\n\nWith the exception of 1968, when North Korea killed one sailor, captured the USS Pueblo and took the rest of the crew hostage, new hostilities have arguably never been closer than they are today.\n\nRelated: Is the US About to Turn Up the Heat on North Korea?\n\nRookie Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday wrapped up his first visits to Japan and South Korea before heading to China, and in one of his strongest statements about anything to date, he warned Pyongyang that its provocative actions would not be tolerated and talked of a pre-emptive strike.\n\nOn almost any other day, that might seem like an empty if not aggressive diplomatic threat. But the U.S. and its longtime South Korean ally are in the middle of war games that include F-18 Super Hornet attack jets soaring off the deck of the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and cruising along the coast of the Korean peninsula; elite troops including Navy Seals, Army Rangers and members of Delta Force joining some 300,000 ROK (Republic of Korea) and almost 20,000 American soldiers on maneuvers; and the positioning of THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Defense) anti-missile systems with powerful radar components, one of which will be in a mountainous region of South Korea about 300 miles southeast of the Demilitarized Zone.\n\n(That THAAD battery, in an ironic twist since it will first become operational under Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump, will be located on a former golf course.)\n\nIn fact, earlier this week, the Pentagon dismissed reports that some elite-troop maneuvers were aimed at “decapitating” the North Korean leadership – though it’s not unlikely such stories were read in Pyongyang.\n\nIn South Korea, where Tillerson visited the DMZ, he said the U.S. would not enter into any negotiations with North Korea over its missile and nuclear programs – a position similar to one taken by the Obama Administration that reflects Pyongyang’s history of reneging on promises to back off.\n\nNorth Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 and then after multiple violations, formally withdrew 18 years later. That same year, 2003, it pulled out of a 1992 agreement to keep the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. In 2005, North Korea admitted that it was building nuclear weapons.\n\nRelated: Tillerson’s Asia Trip Could Signal the End US Soft Diplomacy\n\nOn New Year’s Day of this year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said his country was getting ready to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, which would have the range to strike the U.S. North Korea also says it can produce a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on an ICBM, though none of its claims have been verified.\n\nEarly this month, North Korea launched four missiles intended to threaten U.S. bases in Japan. They landed in the Sea of Japan, some about 190 miles off the coast.\n\nTillerson made clear that the Trump Administration would not even consider talks until North Korea denuclearized and gave up its “weapons of mass destruction.”\n\nThe U.S.’s increasingly hard line may well reflect several new realities:\n\nWhile the Obama Administration's cyber war against North Korea may have partially disrupted its missile program, the latest \"testing\" suggests the hack attacks are no longer working.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina seems increasingly unable to control client state North Korea. The killing of Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother at the Kuala Lumpur airport February demonstrates this: Beijing reportedly saw Kim Jong-nam as a possible replacement, but Malaysian authorities believe North Korean operatives engineered his assassination by having young women smear his face with a highly toxic nerve agent.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Jong-un is arguably more blood-thirsty than his father or grandfather and seems more unhinged. He has slaughtered many of his top generals – in some cases with antiaircraft guns -- and other members of the leadership in Pyongyang, including his uncle by marriage, a key adviser who had close ties to China and was originally thought to be the man who would be the shadow leader of the country. Now there seems to be no one who can rein in Kim Jong-un.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised a harder line on North Korea, which with Iran neutralized for the moment, is the most dangerous nuclear rogue on the planet. But he is being more confrontational than might have been imagined.\n\nEven with Tillerson now in Beijing and scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, Trump on Friday tweeted: “North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been ‘playing’ the United States for years. China has done little to help!”\n\nThat may not make diplomatic life any easier for Tillerson, but China, too, seems frustrated by its inability to get Kim Jong-un under control. A New York Times story on Saturday said that Kim remains unmoved by Beijing’s economic pressure because he clings to nuclear weapons as the only guarantee of safeguarding his power and family dynasty.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Reuters reported that Kim was on hand for tests of a high-thrust engine and crowed about “the new birth” of the nation’s rocket program.\n\nCorrection: The story has been corrected. An earlier version stated that the USS Carl Vinson is equipped with F-35 aircraft, but the F-35 is not scheduled for deployment on U.S. aircraft carriers for several more years."

    "text": "It’s hard to predict precisely how the puzzle pieces will eventually fall. Yet Republicans made it clear last week that – one way or another – the 52-year-old Medicaid program for the poor and disabled is headed for significant changes in the coming year.\n\nAlthough President Trump promised during the campaign that he would protect Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security from budget cuts or radical changes, Medicaid was put into play by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other conservatives in drafting legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The fate of that legislation is in doubt, with both conservatives and moderates raising strong objections to a bill likely to come up for a vote this week in the House.\n\nRelated: Trump's Health Chief Fails to Convince Patients They'll Get the Care They Need\n\nEven if that legislation fails – or undergoes significant change – the Trump administration and House Republicans are working on separate legislation and administrative actions that would significantly tighten state eligibility regulations and impose new requirements including that able-bodied beneficiaries find work or pay for part of their health coverage.\n\n“Certainly Medicaid is under assault here . . . and what is being proposed is the biggest threat to the program since it was enacted in the 1960s,” said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 75 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. While the program has been a lifesaver for millions of people, the growing numbers and associated costs have conservatives worried about runaway spending, fraud and waste.\n\nMedicaid spending grew 9.7 percent to $545.1 billion in 2015, or 17 percent of total national expenditures on health, according to government data. That increase was twice the rate of growth in spending for Medicare for the elderly.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nMoreover, federal spending on Medicaid expansion under Obamacare proved to be much costlier than originally predicted, according to an analysis by Forbes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated in its 2014 Medicaid Actuarial Report that newly eligible enrollees would cost $4,281, on average, in 2015. Yet a 2015 CMS report issued in July 2016, the per capita cost was $6,366—a 49 percent increase.\n\nThe most immediate question is whether House Republicans can agree among themselves on a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act that will phase out the expanded version of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. That program has grown in popularity -- even in more conservative states – and currently provides health care coverage to more than 11 million able-bodied childless adults or parents who previously were excluded from Medicaid.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump bill headed for House floor action this week would phase out the expanded Medicaid coverage beginning in 2020, or even sooner if conservative critics have their way. That change if approved would represent a serious blow to a large segment of the U.S. population that has struggled without health insurance for years.\n\nThe change would effectively freeze out millions of people who would have received coverage if the program were still in existence while causing current enrollees to eventually lose their coverage.\n\nA far more serious threat to low income Americans, however, is a provision in the bill that would impose a new per capita limit on federal matching funds for Medicaid, rather than continuing to treat the program as an open-ended entitlement.\n\nThat move would effectively shift costs and risks to the states and put coverage at risk for millions, according to some analysts. Essentially, states would receive a fixed amount of funds to provide coverage for an individual that would be adjusted for inflation in medical costs.\n\nRelated: Tom Price’s Big Claim: People Won’t Get Shafted on Health Care\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the GOP health care replacement plan found that the Medicaid cuts in the bill and the new per-capita spending cap would result in Medicaid enrollment declining by 14 million. Overall, the CBO projected that 24 million would either lose or decline their insurance by 2026.\n\n“The bill needs its deep Medicaid cuts — $880 billion over ten years in total — to offset its hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy, pharmaceutical companies, and insurers, and states simply couldn’t make those cuts without harming millions of Medicaid beneficiaries,” said an analysis published last week by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump replacement bill has encountered stiff resistance in the House and is considered unpassable in the Senate in its current form with some conservatives saying it isn’t tough enough and moderates saying it goes too far and leaves many of their constituents without insurance coverage.\n\nTrump boasted on Friday that he has begun winning over conservative dissidents and predicted a victory when the bill comes to a vote in the House this week. “I think we have a very unified Republican party,” he said at a Friday news conference.\n\nWilliam Galston, a political and public policy expert with the Brookings Institution, said last week, “I would be amazed if any bill emerges from the Senate that’s within hailing distance of the bill that emerges from the House.”\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\n“My gut tells me we are a long way from a legislative product signed by the president that would redo Medicaid,” he added. “Unlike members of the House, most of whom are in safe districts, there are a lot of red-state senators whose citizens have participated in the Medicaid expansion, and many of them voted for Donald Trump, and I think Trump knows that.”\n\nBut even if the legislation goes down in the House or fails in the Senate, congressional Republicans and the new Trump administration are seeking ways to tighten eligibility rules that have long been championed by conservative lawmakers and think tanks like the Heritage Foundation.\n\nOn Thursday, for example, House Budget Committee Republicans signaled they would pursue legislation requiring able bodied adults without children to find work or lose their coverage. Many conservatives have complained for years that Medicaid beneficiaries were free-loaders who should be making money to defray their health care costs.\n\nResearch by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the CBPP indicate that between 60 percent and 80 percent of adult Medicaid recipients live in families where at least one person is a full-time or part time employee. Many of those who don't hold jobs have an illness or disability that prevents them from working or are care givers to other members of their families.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nWhile Democrats and liberal advocacy groups are on high alert regarding what they see as growing peril for Medicaid, others are less certain about the prospects for change -- even if Trump and his congressional allies miraculously pass the Obamacare replacement legislation pending in the House.\n\n“I’m not sure,” said Michael Cannon, a health care policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute. “In fact, the bill as it exists right now does not make serious changes in Medicaid.”\n\nEchoing the concerns of conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and other factions, Cannon said that the prosed repeal of the Medicaid expansion is “unserious” because it doesn’t begin to take effect until 2020 and contains too many loopholes.\n\nHe also argued that the proposed per capita matching grants to the states might have the unintended effect of encouraging states to enroll more able-bodied adults to generate more income while cutting back on benefits to vulnerable populations.\n\n“So the Medicaid provisions are just more of the same,” Cannon insisted in an interview, dismissing the Ryan-Trump legislation as “Obamacare Lite.”"

But everyone has been provoked by an unstable North Korean dictator who appears to want to do more than test his growing supply of illicit nuclear weapons — he wants to use them. His threats are changing how other countries in the region are responding to the North Korean menace.\n\nThe United States has sent naval vessels to the South China Sea and deployed its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) to South Korea. That is irritating China, which has been building up its presence in the area. Japan has fortified its naval capability, presumably with anti-missile capability on board its new ships.\n\nBut Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s erratic president, has his own agenda and doesn’t seem to care that China doesn’t appreciate one of its satellite countries going rogue on nukes.\n\nHow should Tillerson handle a bad actor like Kim Jong-un? China, Japan and South Korea want to negotiate a deal. But Tillerson said Friday, “The policy of strategic patience has ended. We’re exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures.” He warned that the administration could take pre-emptive action “if they elevate the threat of their weapons program [to an unacceptable level].

    "text": "President Trump may have rendered himself irrelevant to the budget debate this year.\n\nBy submitting a budget that postpones consideration of the long-term debt while calling for deep cuts in domestic programs that even his GOP allies denounce as draconian, Trump and his budget director Mick Mulvaney may be taking themselves out of the game before it even gets started.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nA day after Trump formally submitted his “America First” budget sketch to Congress that focuses exclusively on discretionary defense and domestic programs while kicking consideration of the debt and entitlement spending to a later time, the preliminary verdicts rolling in from Capitol Hill and independent budget analysts is that Trump’s approach shouldn’t be taken seriously.\n\nTrump has called for a $54 billion increase in defense spending next year to insure U.S. military supremacy around the world, while insisting that it be offset dollar-for-dollar by cuts in spending for domestic programs and the general operation of the federal government.\n\nSource: Congressional Budget Office\n\nRep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the former chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a highly regarded voice on fiscal matters, told reporters Thursday that while Trump’s efforts to avoid adding to the deficit are commendable, “I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the president’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counter-productive.”\n\nRogers, like many Republican veterans on Capitol Hill, stressed that Congress controls the federal purse strings and that the president’s defense and domestic spending proposals will undergo intense scrutiny – and almost certain change.\n\nRelated: Did Trump’s Budget Chief Really Say Cutting Meals Programs Is ‘Compassionate’?\n\nComing from a real estate businessman and former reality TV host renowned for his bargaining prowess, Trump’s budget proposal might suggest to some a shrewd opening bid, with the understanding the White House and congressional leaders eventually would compromise on spending levels much to the liking of the new president.\n\nYet many of Trump’s proposed cuts -- ranging from 12 percent for the departments of the Interior and Housing and Urban Development to an eye-popping 29 percent for the State Department and 31 percent for the Environmental Protection Agency – are so out of line with long-established, bipartisan spending norms that they have virtually no chance of coming even close to what eventually will be approved.\n\nSteve Bell, a former Senate Republican budget official now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, dismissed Trump’s budget as little more than political “messaging” to his conservative base and a wish list of massive cuts to social safety-net, research and arts programs that conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation have been advocating for years.\n\nBell’s service on Capitol Hill dates back to the Reagan administration of the 1980s, when a new Republican president and GOP-dominated Senate sought to scale back the size of government by freezing or significantly cutting domestic programs, including the school lunch program.\n\n“I know all presidential budgets have a messaging component to them, but this [Trump proposal] seems to me only a messaging type budget,” Bell said in an interview Friday. “And it’s aimed at people who don’t know much about where spending in the federal government really goes … There’s a certain vindictiveness to it that I never saw in the Reagan budget.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s NIH Budget Cuts Threaten a Serious Setback in Medical Research\n\nTrump ran on a highly mixed populist message of downsizing an entrenched Washington bureaucracy and whacking away at a national debt fast approaching $20 trillion while simultaneously pledging an historic buildup of the military and homeland security and major tax cuts to spur the economy.\n\nIt has been clear for many months that Trump’s budget math will never add up. For all of his lip service to fiscal restraint, budget and tax analysts have repeatedly projected that Trump’s policies will add trillions of dollars to the national debt in the coming years.\n\nMulvaney, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget and a former Tea Party Republican House member from South Carolina, stressed in press briefings this week that the budget unveiled on Thursday was never intended to address Social Security, Medicare and other major entitlement programs that are the main drivers of deficit spending.\n\nThat conversation will be put off until later this spring, at the earliest, which means that decisions on domestic and defense spending must be made in a political vacuum with little consideration of how discretionary spending fits into the larger challenge of slowing the growth of the deficit. After years of decline, the deficit has begun to climb again and likely will reach $441 billion this year.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nAsked during a news conference on Thursday how Trump intends to deal with the nation’s festering debt problems, Mulvaney replied: “It’s a fair question. I would just suggest to you it’s not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt. It even doesn’t even deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process.”\n\nGovernment spending watchdogs have argued for years that only a more comprehensive, holistic approach of discretionary spending cuts, entitlement reforms and tax increases will achieve a balanced budget and long-term fiscal stability. “By focusing only on discretionary spending, this budgets effectively ignores 70 percent of spending and 90 percent of its growth over the next decade,” writes Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nTrump ruled out changes to Social Security and Medicare during the campaign and for now he appears to be sticking to his guns. Tax increases are also out of the question. Trump and congressional Republican leaders are planning to unveil plans for massive corporate and individual tax cuts later this spring or summer.\n\nSo in the future, Trump will have little wiggle room politically other than to insist on more cuts to domestic programs and foreign aid and hope that his tax cuts will eventually produce the 4 percent annual GDP growth he is promising to expand the economy and generate more government revenue to offset spending.\n\n“The fact is that until the president and Congress are willing to address the real drivers of our debt, Medicare and Social Security, we will be complicit in shackling future generations with the financial burden of our own lack of discipline,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said Thursday. “This is not a legacy I want to leave.”\n\nThe Navy’s $35 Million Scandal: Hookers, Booze and a Guy Named ‘Fat Leonard’"

    "text": "Nearly three years after the scandal first broke that hundreds of veterans had died waiting for medical treatment at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, the VA continues to operate under a cloud of doubt.\n\nDespite numerous reforms and improvements and tens of billions of dollars in new funding to upgrade medical treatment and eliminate long waiting lists, the VA remains on the Government Accountability Office’s notorious “High Risk List” of agencies prone to mismanagement, waste and even fraud.\n\nRelated: VA Hospitals Struggle With a Growing Problem: Drug Theft by Employees\n\nThe VA – one of only a handful of federal departments that received a funding increase under President Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget plan released on Thursday, will be undergoing yet another round of reforms and improvements under the new administration.\n\n“We're going to straighten out the VA for our veterans,” Trump said in January, in announcing his choice of Dr. David Shulkin as the new VA secretary. “I've promised that for a long time, and it's something I feel very, very strongly.\n\nThe VA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the country, including 168 medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities organized in regional networks. The number of people who have enrolled in the VA health care system has mushroomed from 7.9 million in fiscal year 2006 to nearly nine million last year.\n\nThroughout that same period, VA’s Veterans Health Administration’s total budget increased substantially, from $37.8 billion in FY 2006 to $91.2 billion in FY 2016. In response to the many serious and long-festering problems with access to VA health care, a $10 billion “Veterans Access” law was enacted in 2014 to provide temporary authority for veterans to obtain health care services from non-VA providers if they have to wait too long.\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on VA After Health Care Scandal\n\nBut despite these and some other notable improvements during the final years of the Obama administration and the leadership of former secretary Robert A. McDonald, the GAO added the troubled agency to its high-risk list in 2015 out of concern about the VA’s inability to ensure the “timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety” of veterans’ health care.\n\nDebra A. Draper, GAO’s director of health care, told the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee this week that VA officials had met only two of five crucial criteria for successful operation – including demonstrating leadership ability through the creation of task forces and other positive action and properly developing an action plan to address continued inadequacies in the agency’s health care system.\n\nHowever, the VA has fallen well short of meeting three other criteria for escaping the list: demonstrating the capacity to address the major areas of concern, closely monitoring implementation of corrective actions, and demonstrating that progress is being made.\n\nSince the VA was added to the list in 2015, the GAO has conducted two follow-up reports examining mental health and primary care access at VA medical facilities. Both studies found “wide variation in the time that veterans waited for primary and mental health care,” Draper said.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nShe said those problems partly stemmed from “a lack of clear, updated policies for appointment scheduling,” which led to “inconsistent and unreliable wait-time data.” In short, for all its efforts and reforms, VA health care facilities continue to leave patients waiting too long to receive needed treatment.\n\nIndeed, last year there were reports that the wait time at VA facilities had gotten worse. Compared to the situation in 2015 levels, there were 70,000 more appointments that took veterans at least a month to be seen. The VA blamed the problem on a huge surge in demand for care, but it was apparent the problem had more to do with the confusing and complicated way Veterans Choice was set up.\n\nVA has implemented about 50 percent of the recommendations GAO has made to the agency. However, there continue to be more than 100 open recommendations related to VA health care. Nearly a quarter of those recommendations have remained open for three or more years.\n\nRelated: VA Program to Slash Patient Waiting Times a Bust\n\nThe GAO’s high risk list dates to the early 1990s, and more than 60 different agencies and areas of government have been on the list at one time or another. Trump no doubt would like to see the VA come off the list as a sign of improved service and management. But Draper said that on average it has taken agencies nine years to get off the black list."

    "text": "It was clear as soon as Rex Tillerson arrived in Tokyo late Wednesday that the new secretary of state’s first trip to Asia could turn out to be a mission impossible. In a six-day tour of three nations, the unproven diplomat is tasked with persuading Japan, South Korea, and China to support a tough, military-first strategy to counter North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.\n\nUnless Tillerson has a lot of rabbits in his hat, it can’t be done. All three nations have made their preference for new negotiations with the North Korean regime clear.\n\nRelated: F-35s and Navy SEALs: Trump’s Powerful Warning to North Korea\n\nTillerson’s tour is an opening round in an extended process. But early signals indicate that Washington risks serious damage to important relationships across the Pacific—notably with China and South Korea—if it remains as inflexible as it appears.\n\nIt has been plain since Barack Obama’s final months in office that the status quo on the Korean Peninsula isn’t working. Kim Jung-un, the North Korean erratic leader, fired roughly two dozen missiles last year and conducted the nation’s fourth and fifth nuclear tests—the last the most powerful to date. There have been five more missile launches already this year.\n\n“We have 20 years of a failed approach,” Tillerson said after talks in Tokyo Thursday with Fumio Kishida, his Japanese counterpart. “In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required.”\n\nThat was a good start. Subtly or otherwise, America’s main allies in Asia have made it plain they judge the Obama administration’s strategy since 2009—sanctions combined with a fortified military posture—a failure. So does Beijing. The alternatives, everyone agrees, are negotiations or military confrontation.\n\nRelated: Tillerson Underlines Cooperation With Japan, Seoul on North Korea\n\nBut is that where agreement between Washington and East Asia ends? At this early moment, it looks like it.\n\nTillerson was careful to avoid details of the administration’s thinking. “Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,” he said in Tokyo Thursday.\n\nAs diplomacy-speak that’s good, but officials in Washington had already dispensed with the niceties by the time Tillerson boarded his plane. The Voice of America reported from the State Department Monday that “Washington said it is ‘moving farther away’ from considering the option of direct engagement with the North Koreans.”\n\nTwo days later an administration official told Reuters, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system the Pentagon deployed in South Korea over China’s vigorous objections: “THAAD is non-negotiable. This is one of those things where Beijing is just going to have to adapt or live in a perpetual cycle of outrage.”\n\nThat’s a worrisome idea of diplomacy with the world’s No. 2 economy. It appears to be another example of what happens when the Pentagon, not State, runs Asia policy—a problem in trans–Pacific relations for the past seven decades.\n\nRelated: North Korea’s Missile Test Leaves Trump with Three Options\n\nBefore Tillerson boarded his plane Wednesday evening, a common line among think tank experts was that he would eschew Clintonesque flash to “quietly and effectively get the job done.” Given what he’s up against, a quiet trip—and probably an effective one—looks unlikely:\n\n• Japan. Tokyo will prove Tillerson’s least complicated stop. After his summit with Trump last month, Premier Shinzo Abe signaled that Japan is prepared to participate if the Trump administration decides to reopen negotiations with the North. But while Abe prefers negotiations, his first concern is Japan’s security, and he’ll take it any way he can get it.\n\nAbe is a nationalist hawk of the old school, let’s not forget. This week his government announced plans to send its largest naval vessel, a helicopter carrier, through the South China Sea to join U.S.–led exercises in the Indian Ocean. It will be Japan’s biggest naval deployment since 1945.\n\n• South Korea. Tillerson steps onto a very tricky path when he arrives in Seoul Friday. He’s charged with persuading Seoul to hew to a hard line toward the North and accepting the deployment of the THAAD system, even though South Korean voters don’t want either.\n\nRelated: North Korea Remains the Most Reviled Country Among Americans in New Poll\n\nEverything exploded when Park Geun-Hye, a hawk on North Korea and a strong Pentagon ally, was deposed on corruption charges one week ago. Elections are now due in May, and the opposition Democrats are ascendant. Moon Jae-in, their candidate, favors new talks with the North, reinstituting Kim Dae-Jung's “sunshine policy,” and blocking the THAAD system. Moon’s the clear favorite in the polls, with support hovering between 30 percent and 36 percent.\n\nIt’s hard to see how Tillerson can hoe this row without making a mess. It’s not the first time South Koreans have taken a stand against the Pentagon’s plans, but Koreans won their admirable democracy the hard way, and the unpopular Park’s fall leaves them especially prickly about it.\n\n• China. Beijing has been crystal clear on two points lately. One, it considers new negotiations a matter of urgency—as it signaled dramatically when it cut off the North’s coal shipments last month. Two, it is irate over the THAAD system in South Korea—concerned that it is an unneeded provocation and gives the Pentagon the ability to peer deep inside Chinese territory.\n\nAs a clear measure of China’s anxieties, the foreign ministry proposed last week that the U.S. and South Korea call off their annual military drills, now under way, in exchange for a suspension of the North’s nuclear activities. Although Washington rejected the suggestion, the ministry repeated it on the eve of Tillerson’s flight from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nRelated: U.S. Deploys Anti-Missile System in South Korea\n\nTillerson’s brief in Beijing is to smooth relations after a stony start when Trump took office while identifying trade-offs to induce Beijing to accept THAAD as a fact on the ground. That looks like another tough assignment for three reasons.\n\nOne, Beijing’s signals indicate it doesn’t consider THAAD any more negotiable than Washington does. Two, its calls for new negotiations with Pyongyang, probably via the “six-party” format that previously brought the U.S. to the table with five partners, have been incessant for some months.\n\nThree, Beijing hasn’t been backing down on much lately, even when the stakes are high, as in the South China Sea. Does Washington have an enticement big enough to get the Chinese to cave on this one? It’s unlikely.\n\nThe Trump administration is putting a lot at risk if the determination is to avoid the negotiation table. And with the Iran nuclear accord in view, there’s no argument that a perilous standoff is the best “new approach.” The dealmaker should deal on this one."

    "text": "The White House press briefing on Thursday afternoon featured a near-meltdown by Press Secretary Sean Spicer as he sparred with reporters over President Trump’s claims about surveillance during the 2016 election. But an appearance at the start of the event by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney was equally stunning in its own way.\n\nDefending the administration’s budget proposal that he been released earlier in the day, Mulvaney made a string of seemingly hard-hearted pronouncements about the rationale for slashing programs that provide funding for things like Meals on Wheels, which delivers food to elderly shut-ins, and after school programs that provide food for hungry children.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe context was a discussion of Community Development Block Grants, which the administration wants to eliminate from the federal budget. Around since the 1970s, CDBGs are used to fund a variety of programs at the discretion of the states receiving them. Reporters at the briefing pointed out that by eliminating them, programs like Meals on Wheels and after-school education programs would lose significant funding.\n\nMulvaney said that was an acceptable outcome, because programs like Meals on Wheels don’t “show results.”\n\nIt was unclear what sort of results Mulvaney meant, particularly with regard to a program that literally relieves hunger, but when he was asked if the cuts seemed a bit harsh, he said that on the contrary they were actually “compassionate.”\n\n“I think it’s one of the most compassionate things we can do,” he said. “You’re only focusing on half the equation. You’re focusing on recipients of the money. We’re focusing on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place. And I think it’s fairly compassionate to go to them and say look, ‘We’re not going to ask you for your hard-earned money anymore, single mom of two in Detroit. Give us your money.’ We’re not going to do that anymore unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function, and I think that’s about as compassionate as you can get.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s NIH Budget Cuts Threaten a Serious Setback in Medical Research\n\nSetting aside the fact that a single mother of two in Detroit stands a pretty good chance of having no or even negative federal income tax liability in a given year, Mulvaney’s claim that the program doesn’t show results was also quickly debunked.\n\nMick Mulvaney says Meals on Wheels \"not showing any results.\" Actual peer-reviewed research says otherwise. https://t.co/B6ZRxtWIAf pic.twitter.com/YI6jiAgMBk — Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) March 16, 2017\n\nThen Mulvaney claimed that after school programs, particularly ones that provide food to children at risk of hunger, are also ineffective and undeserving of federal funds.\n\n“They’re supposed to be educational programs, right? That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to help kids who don’t get fed at home get fed so they do better in school. Guess what? There’s no demonstrable evidence they’re actually doing that. There’s no demonstrable evidence they’re actually helping results, helping kids do better in school which is what, when we took your money from you, to say, ‘Look, we’re going to go spend it on an after school program,’ the way we justified it was these programs are going to help kids do better in school and get better jobs and we can’t prove that that’s happening.”\n\nThe thing is, there actually is evidence that after school programs that provide healthy snacks can help improve students’ academic performance, even if only by reducing the generalized stress on kids suffering in poverty and hunger.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nMulvaney also threw the Head Start program under the bus, and justified the administration’s plan to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by saying that it was unfair for coal miners and single mothers to have to support public television. This despite the fact that one of the major functions of PBS, for example, is creating educational content for young children who may not be getting the stimulation they need at home.\n\nThe OMB director also airily dismissed concern about the administration’s decision to eliminate funding for programs meant to study and combat climate change. “We’re not spending money on that anymore. We consider that to be a waste of your money.”\n\nWhile the Trump budget plan may be bad news for hungry elders and kids, fans of public radio and people who care about the environment, there’s at least one group of people who are likely excited: the actors in the running to play Mulvaney on this week’s episode of Saturday Night Live."

    "text": "Federal funding for biomedical and scientific research has long been a contentious government issue, with occasional dramatic flare-ups over the choice of grantees and the efficacy of their scientific methodology. But few doubt that the hundreds of billions of dollars spent over the years have frequently paid off with important medical and public health breakthroughs.\n\nRecently, a five-year study financed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that cutting-edge immunotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation proved highly effective in the treatment of a common form of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that attacks the central nervous system.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nA team of researchers funded by NIH’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recently reported developing techniques for preventing alcohol use among American Indian teenagers in northeastern Oklahoma. Another group of scientists funded by NIH’s National Cancer Institute and National Human Genome Research Institute made important genetic findings in the treatment of cervical cancer.\n\nAnd other government-sponsored studies on how electric fields affect bacteria led to the development of an important cancer medicine called Cisplatin, which is used in the treatment of ovarian, breast, bladder and testicular cancer.\n\nBasic government-sponsored research has provided an impressive return on investment, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. “Regardless of what measure is used – reduced health care costs or increased productivity from longer, healthier lives – every dollar spent on basic research yield returns ranging from $10 to more than $80.”\n\nAfter years of relatively flat funding of medical and scientific research, the Republican-controlled Congress approved a $2 billion increase in NIH’s annual budget a year ago and appeared on the verge of approving an additional $2 billion for the current fiscal year. But NIH’s future has been suddenly cast into doubt by the Trump Administration’s decision to seek a 19 percent cut in the agency’s $30.3 billion annual budget.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nThe $5.8 billion reductions in NIH funding for grants and aid is contained in the fiscal 2018 budget blueprint President Trump submitted to Congress on Thursday, which seeks draconian cuts in many federal agencies and programs to help offset a $54 billion increase in defense spending. Trump is seeking deep cuts in a wide array of scientific endeavors, particularly within the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies engaged in climate change research.\n\nThe NIH is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which came in for cuts of more than $15 billion or nearly 18 percent of its operating funds. Trump’s spending plan -- which is subject to review and alterations by lawmakers -- also calls for a “major reorganization” of NIH’s 27 institutes and centers. Moreover, it would abolish the Fogarty International Center, which funds research on global health needs and initiatives.\n\n“Drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget run counter to the priorities of our nation, national security, and the aspirations of Americans,” Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research! America, a non-profit research and public advocacy group, said in a statement today. “Our nation was built on hard work, a determination to create a better future for our children, and empathy, not apathy, in the face of human suffering. This budget proposal cuts life-saving research and public health services that are fundamental to that vision.”\n\nRelated: Brought to You By the Trump Budget: Endless PBS Pledge Drives\n\nMore than 80 percent of NIH’s funding is awarded through nearly 50,000 competitive grants to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions throughout the country. About 10 percent of NIH's budget supports projects conducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories, which are primarily located on the agency’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nBetween fiscal 2003 and 2015, NIH fell into political disfavor and lost 22 percent of its capacity to fund research projects because of budget cuts, sequestration and inflationary losses. As the money dried up, NIH was forced to scale back its grant-making and other research activity substantially.\n\nBut that began to turn around a year ago when a bipartisan coalition got behind increased funding for the agency. Even one of Trump’s senior campaign advisers, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), called for a doubling of the agency’s budget as a moral and financial imperative. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, told reporters at the time that he was optimistic that funding in the future would be predictable and on the upswing.\n\nThree senior Republicans on key committees with spending authority and oversight over NIH played critical roles -- Sens. Roy Blunt (MO) and Lamar Alexander (TN) and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Together, they helped push Congress to take a first big step in bolstering funding for NIH with a $2 billion increase in fiscal 2016.\n\n\n\nBrought to You By the Trump Budget: Endless PBS Pledge Drives\n\nThe Senate recommended another $2 billion increase in the current fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30. However, Congress has yet to complete work on this year’s spending measures, and Trump’s budget plan could put a damper on additional funding for the agency.\n\nMuch will depend on the determination of NIH’s allies on Capitol Hill. Cole, who is chairman of an appropriation subcommittee with jurisdiction over NIH, told the on-line health care publication STAT earlier this month that he hoped to increase the agency’s funding by as much as $2 billion this year.\n\nAnd Blunt issued a statement yesterday, cautioning that Trump’s proposed discretionary spending cuts were merely the first step in a long legislative process and making it clear Trump hasn’t made an adequate case yet for such dire cuts.\n\n\"The president’s budget is the first step in the appropriations process,” Blunt said. “There are many concerns with non-defense discretionary cuts. Over the next several weeks, we’ll be holding hearings with cabinet secretaries and others involved to determine funding priorities for fiscal year 2018.\""

    "text": "As the Marines grapple with an uproar over photos of naked women jarheads being passed around the internet, new revelations are emerging in a sordid, long-running Navy scandal involving alleged bribes over an eight-year period that cost the service tens of millions of dollars.\n\nRelated: Dozens of Navy Officials Bribed with Cash, Prostitutes\n\nEarlier this week, the Justice Department released an indictment of seven Navy officers – including an admiral and four captains – and a Marine colonel for giving military contractor Leonard Glenn “Fat Leonard” Francis inside information, some of which was classified, in exchange for $25,000 watches, Cuban cigars, $2,000 bottles of liquor, stays in pricey hotels and champagne-fueled parties with hookers, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn one incident at a Manila hotel, Navy revelers engaged in a multi-day party, guzzling all the Dom Pérignon available and costing Fat Leonard some $50,000, the Post said.\n\n“In 2011,” the Post said, “Glenn Defense won deals valued at $200 million to service U.S. vessels at ports stretching from the Russian Far East to Australia.” Fat Leonard has admitted that his Singapore-based company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia, defrauded the Navy of more than $35 million, according to the Justice Department.\n\nBesides Fat Leonard -- a 6’3”, 350-lb. native of Malaysia who is awaiting sentencing and said to be cooperating with investigators -- multiple Navy officers and civilian employees have admitted to being part of the far-flung corruption network.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Naval Buildup Could Cost $750 Billion Over 30 Years\n\nAmong them is a Navy commander, 28-year veteran Michael Vannak Khiem Misiewicz, who was sentenced to six years in federal prison last April for giving Glenn Defense confidential information about ballistic missile defenses and schedules for the U.S. 7th Fleet, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nRear Admiral Robert Gilbeau, the highest-ranking active officer charged, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators, and 30 other admirals are said to be under investigation.\n\nBut Fat Leonard’s tentacles didn’t just extend to the officer corps; he also compromised at least one investigator looking into the corruption scandal, which has been called the largest case of fraud in U.S. Navy history. Last October, an officer of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service was sentenced to 12 years in prison for helping to keep Fat Leonard one step ahead of the law by supplying him with more than 80 reports on his criminal activities.\n\nThe highest-ranking officer charged this week is retired Rear Adm. Bruce Loveless, a former director of naval intelligence.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nAs new developments emerge in the Fat Leonard scandal, the Marines are confronting a different kind of controversy: The sharing of explicit photos of women Marines on a Facebook page hosted by a 30,000-member group called Marines United. The group page has been taken down, but the photos reportedly exist on a different Facebook page.\n\nOn Tuesday, Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller underwent a grilling on Capitol Hill over a culture of sexual harassment in the corps. Facing sharp questioning by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Neller said: “I know you've heard it before, but we are going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we treat each other. That's a lame answer, but ma'am, that's the best I can tell you right now. We've got to change, and that's on me.\""

    "text": "If you think public broadcasting pledge drives are annoying now, just wait until the Trump administration’s proposed budget goes into effect. The plan proposed Thursday guts various government agencies, from the State Department to the Environmental Protection Agency, but it also eliminates completely many others, among them the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nCPB provides grants and other funding to public television and radio stations across the country and is also the umbrella organization for well-known broadcast entities like the Public Broadcasting System and National Public Radio.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget\n\nThe corporation’s grants to independently owned radio and television public broadcasting stations provide a very significant share of their funding in most cases, particularly in rural areas where government funding is scarce and the opportunity to recruit private sector sponsors is more limited.\n\nMany members of the Republican Party have, for decades, harbored the desire to eliminate CPB and the programming it supports. Their reasons generally fall into one of two areas: They object to the idea of the government funding broadcast media that competes with the private sector and/or they believe that the programs supported by CPB funding tend to be biased toward a more liberal point of view.\n\nHowever, on the question of competition, officials point out that most of the stations CPB supports are in largely underserved parts of the country where corporate media sees little upside to an investment in newsgathering or other local programming.\n\nThe complaints of bias may feel more justified. On the whole, the audience for CPB supported programming skews more Democratic and liberal than the rest of the country, However, NPR, PBS, and the stations that accept CBP funding are all bound by requirements that they balance their coverage and do not take political positions. Additionally, NPR and PBS tend to score very well in surveys asking people what news sources they view as trustworthy.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nOthers have argued against the CPB on fiscal grounds, saying that cutting it would simply save the taxpayer money, but in the context of the Trump administration’s budget proposal, those claims ring a little hollow. The CPB had a budget of $445 million in 2016, equal to 0.07 percent of the administration’s proposed Pentagon budget, and only 0.8 percent of the $54 billion increase the Trump budget would give to defense spending next year.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison defended her organization.\n\n“Public media is one of America’s best investments,” she said. “At approximately $1.35 per citizen per year, it pays huge dividends to every American. From expanding opportunity, beginning with proven children’s educational content to providing essential news and information as well as ensuring public safety and homeland security through emergency alerts, this vital investment strengthens our communities. It is especially critical for those living in small towns and in rural and underserved areas.”\n\nSome of the bigger names in the public broadcasting universe, including NPR and PBS, have strong private sector and philanthropic partnerships that provide a considerable share of their funding. But revenue from member stations that buy their programming would be slashed by the funding cuts, leading to what Harrison described as an inevitable disappearance of public programming.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Government Reorganization: Hatchet Job, or Just Major Surgery?\n\n“There is no viable substitute for federal funding that ensures Americans have universal access to public media’s educational and informational programming and services,” she said. “The elimination of federal funding to CPB would initially devastate and ultimately destroy public media’s role in early childhood education, public safety, connecting citizens to our history, and promoting civil discussions – all for Americans in both rural and urban communities.”\n\nPerhaps Harrison is wrong, and there would be enough support from the public to support the stations that CPB now helps fund. But it would take an awful lot of tote bags and promotional coffee mug giveaways to fill what promises to be a funding gap in the hundreds of millions of dollars."

    "text": "Health and Human Secretary Tom Price, on Wednesday night, spent an uncomfortable hour in a CNN-hosted town hall Wednesday night, answering questions from stony-faced cancer patients, medical professionals and others demanding an explanation of how Americans -- particularly poor and low-income Americans -- will be able to afford health care coverage under the Republicans’ proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis appearance was largely overwhelmed by the furor over massive budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration and a federal court ruling that struck down the president’s second attempt to institute a ban on people from six majority-Muslim countries entering the United States. And that’s a shame because the difficulty he had offering clear answers to the concerns his questioners raised suggests future struggles as the GOP tries to sell the bill to the American people.\n\nRelated: How Republicans Got Trapped by Their Health Care Promises\n\nPrice, a physician himself who Represented Georgia in Congress before accepting a spot in the Trump cabinet, sat down with hosts Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash just days after the Congressional Budget Office released its estimate predicting that 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance coverage by 2026 if the AHCA becomes law.\n\nBash brought up the agency’s finding and asked how the GOP could claim that its proposal increases access to health coverage in the face of a number like that.\n\n“This is very interesting and it's an important question,” Price acknowledged, before going on to largely avoid answering it. The HHS secretary fell back, as other supporters of the bill have done in recent days, on claiming that additional regulatory changes and further legislation removing restrictions on the health insurance markets will generate so much choice and competition that the markets will drive costs down to make insurance affordable for everyone.\n\nHowever, he didn’t specify a single regulation that he would do away with, and the only legislative priorities he identified were removing barriers to the sale of insurance across state lines and reform of the medical malpractice laws, neither of which, according to experts, would have a large impact on the price of coverage.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nPrice then faced a question from Brian Kline, a Pennsylvania man in recovery from colon cancer, whose care was paid for by the Medicaid expansion that the Affordable Care Act created.\n\n“Medicaid expansion saved my life and saved me from medical bankruptcy,” Kline said. “Now, I earn $11.66 an hour at my retail job. And obviously, I cannot afford to pay for my cancer care out of pocket. My life really depends on having access to my doctors and medical care.\n\n“Getting a cancer diagnosis is bad enough. But Medicaid expansion gives me the economic security in knowing that funding is always going to be there for my cancer care. So my question for you, Secretary Price, is pretty straightforward. Why do you want to take -- why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?”\n\n“The fact of the matter is that we don't,” Price replied. “We don't want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”\n\nRelated: Scrambling to Save Their Health Plan, Republicans Consider a Major Change\n\nKline indicated that he was unsatisfied by Price’s answer, but the discussion eventually moved on.\n\nA West Virginia physician, after pointing out that the AHCA would throw one in five of his low-income patients off the Medicaid rolls, asked, “Do you think the members of Congress really understand the hardship that patients will have, particularly those on the edge if they lose their health insurance? And how can we help those patients who don't have health insurance?”\n\n“Yeah, we're not interested in having anybody lose health insurance,” Price said. But instead of addressing the people who would lose insurance under the GOP plan, he pointed out that there are 20 million Americans who chose to pay a penalty rather than comply with the ACA’s individual mandate.\n\nBash then pointed out that the AHCA would massively cut Medicaid spending, lopping about 25 percent. How, she asked, can he promise “that these people can continue to get the care that they got under Obamacare?”\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\n“The premise of that question is that the way that you measure the success of Medicaid is by how much money goes into it,” he said. “We believe the way that you measure the success of a program is whether or not it takes care of the individuals, the beneficiaries that are actually needing that program.”\n\nHe continued, “The fact of the matter is that we believe there's a better way to provide the kind of care and services for Medicaid patients” and said that is “the states, not Washington, D.C.” are allowed to design the programs, the levels of care will be improved despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in funding the system would lose over the next ten years if the AHCA were approved.\n\nPrice faced a question from a former US Marine, now in recovery from opioid addiction, who worried that the AHCA eliminated the requirement that Medicaid provides care to addicts.\n\nPrice insisted that care would still be available, though not necessarily through Medicaid, and returned to the idea that returning authority for designing treatment to the states will work wonders on the system.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would Devastate Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\n“Many of them have been hamstrung by the federal government, not being able to do what they believe is most helpful for their vulnerable population,” he said. “So there are wonderful ways I believe in addressing this in a positive way if we keep our focus on the patient -- not on government, but on the patient.”\n\nOne of the more dramatic moments of the night came when Price was confronted Karen Santana, of Brooklyn, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30.\n\nPointing out that the Republican plan would eliminate the individual mandate, allowing young and healthy people not to purchase health insurance if they are willing to risk a temporary 30 percent surcharge if they get sick and decide they need coverage.\n\n“If the mandate is removed, how will insurance companies be able to afford to pay for people with pre-existing conditions, just like me?”\n\nRelated: How the Tea Party Could End Up Killing the GOP Health Care Plan\n\nPrice answered with a litany of complaints about the Affordable Care Act and repetition of the promise that prices will come down so dramatically under AHCA that even a cancer survivor would be able to afford good coverage with the relatively small tax subsidies available under the plan.\n\nBlitzer pushed back, pointing out the reason insurance works is that people who buy it and don’t wind up needing coverage subsidize those who do.\n\n“So I think what you just said is that you want to force young individuals to purchase coverage so that they can participate in a government program.”\n\nPrice was falling back on the “freedom” argument that House Speaker Paul Ryan has used to defend the AHCA, insisting again that unspecified future changes to the system would create so many great plans that young and healthy consumers will happily purchase coverage.\n\nRelated: Now It’s the Democrats’ Turn to Threaten a Government Shutdown\n\nBut Santana pushed back, saying that most young people really don’t feel that they need coverage. “I want to say that when I was diagnosed, I was 30 years old, and, you know, in the prime of my life, and I had a 9-month-old son. You know, I never thought -- I was very young. I never thought I was going to be diagnosed with this, especially at such a young age. And I know people that are in their 20s and are diagnosed with very severe diseases.”\n\n“And we want them all to have health coverage,” Price insisted. “Every single one of them.”\n\nHow that’s going to happen, though, was still a mystery at the end of the night."

    "text": "If you’ve ever had to dispute a charge on a credit card, fix a mix-up with your mortgage or stop a debt collector from hounding you, you’ve benefited from the work of a federal watchdog agency that is now under fire in Washington.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arguably has done as much to change the financial lives of consumers as any other government agency in history.\n\nMost Americans who have a credit card, bank account, mortgage, student or personal loan, or who care about their credit rating, have been helped by the CFPB. Some 29 million of them, or about 1 of every 8 adults, are receiving direct financial relief — money returned to them — as a result of the bureau’s work since it opened six years ago.\n\nRelated: The Five Biggest Winners and Losers in Trump’s Fiscal 2018 Budget ​\n\nA review of the agency’s record by NerdWallet found that for every $1 in federal spending on the bureau, more than $4 has been placed back in consumers’ pockets. The agency says it has saved or returned to Americans nearly $12 billion since 2011, while costing taxpayers $2.9 billion to operate.\n\nSavings Misleading, Critics Say\n\nBut as congressional conservatives and the Trump administration look to slash federal regulations that they believe have harmed businesses and consumers, the young bureau has been targeted by opponents who want it eliminated.\n\nCritics say the dollar relief the agency claims it has provided consumers is misleading because it fails to account for the costs businesses have absorbed or passed along to customers in the form of higher fees to comply with the CFPB’s regulations, which include new rules to make the mortgage market safer.\n\nRelated: Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump\n\nThe figures also do not account for the hidden damage done to people who cannot qualify for loans under the new rules, agency opponents say.\n\nHowever, NerdWallet found that nearly all financial consumers have benefited from the agency in some way. (Disclosure: NerdWallet CEO Tim Chen is a member of the CFPB Consumer Advisory Board.)\n\nFor example, the bureau slapped Wells Fargo with a $100 million fine last year following a fake accounts scandal involving some 2 million customers. The consumer agency has ordered other large banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank and its subsidiaries, to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution, alleging they charged millions of their customers for services they never received.\n\nThe agency has also taken aim at debt collectors, who have threatened to have debtors arrested over unpaid bills; for-profit colleges, whose predatory lending practices have cost many borrowers tens of thousands of dollars; credit reporting companies, which the bureau says misled consumers about the cost and usefulness of the credit scores they marketed; and mortgage lenders, whose lax lending standards led to millions of foreclosures.\n\nIn addition, the CFPB created a new way of monitoring the financial landscape, building an online hub where customers could lodge grievances against companies and get support in fighting their problems.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won’t Touch Entitlement Reform…Yet\n\nSince going online in 2011, the bureau’s consumer complaint portal has collected more than 1 million responses. Unlike other government agencies that field consumer complaints, the CFPB posts its publicly, including the names of companies and a detailed description of the allegations.\n\nBanking industry leaders want those narratives taken offline. They say the write-ups are riddled with inaccuracies and can be misleading for consumers, causing them to choose products and services that might not be best for them.\n\nAgency Gives Weight to Consumers’ Complaints\n\nThe mere existence of a CFPB complaint may force companies to resolve conflicts, says Raychelle Burks, who contacted the agency after she had problems setting up a repayment plan with her student loan servicer Nelnet.\n\nBurks, an assistant professor of chemistry at St. Edward’s University in Texas, says the company refused to answer her calls and sent her letters claiming she was not responding to its inquiries.\n\nShe provided the CFPB and the Department of Education with the dates and times of her calls and copies of correspondence. Within days, Nelnet’s representatives contacted her to arrange a payment plan.\n\n“Just filing the complaint and having a claim number — all of a sudden, this loan servicer acted completely differently,” she says.\n\nNelnet did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNerdWallet’s review of the CFPB’s performance included dozens of changes implemented by the agency and their effect on the consumer marketplace.\n\nNerdWallet found that the bureau helped stabilize a housing market and economy reeling after the Great Recession by requiring new levels of transparency with mortgages and investments. The agency says it has returned billions of dollars in improper fees to credit card holders and has given all consumers additional credit card rights.\n\nMixed Reaction in Congress\n\n“We know exactly what the landscape would look like without the CFPB,” Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told NerdWallet. “We saw it in the 1990s and in the 2000s in the run-up to the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression.”\n\nNot only did the agency help the nation recover from the recession, but it also will help prevent another crash, she said.\n\nRelated: Now It’s the Democrats’ Turn to Threaten a Government Shutdown\n\nWarren helped start the agency and has been a lightning rod for its critics who say the CFPB has misinterpreted laws, stifled business expansion and made it difficult for companies to plan or budget for the future.\n\nThose opponents are pushing to gut the bureau or at least sharply curtail its powers, starting with firing its director, Richard Cordray, whom they view as a rogue regulator.\n\n“The CFPB is potentially the most powerful, unaccountable agency in the history of government,” Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told NerdWallet. “I don’t know how you can believe in democracy and believe in the CFPB.”\n\nBrad Wolverton is a reporter at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

    "text": "President Trump formally released his 53-page “America First” spending plan for fiscal 2018 Thursday morning calling for sharp increases in defense, homeland security, and veterans’ health care, as well as many tough offsetting cuts in government departments, agencies and programs across a wide spectrum.\n\nIn seeking to make good on his campaign pledges to bulk up the military, destroy ISIS and other terrorist threats and crack down on millions of illegal immigrants, Trump is seeking a $54 billion increase for the Department of Defense and billions more for border security and construction of a wall. At the same time, Trump would slash spending on foreign aid and gut scores of domestic programs and agencies. The State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor were among the hardest hit.\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘Hard Power’ Budget Gives Billions to Defense, Guts Domestic Programs\n\nTrump’s spending plan for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 is focused exclusively on the one-third of the roughly $4 trillion annual federal budget that goes for discretionary programs and general government operations. A more comprehensive budget plan including Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs that are the main drivers of the deficit will be released by the administration later this spring.\n\nMoreover, the spending document released today is only the president’s opening bid in what is likely to be a contentious budget debate in Congress this year. The Republican-controlled Congress will have the final say on spending priorities, including whether to lift legal caps to accommodate all the additional defense spending. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), have predicted that some of Trump’s more draconian spending cuts would be “dead on arrival” on Capitol Hill.\n\nNonetheless, Trump’s spending proposals can’t be ignored, and they will play an important role in determining budgetary policy in the coming year. Here is a list of five of the biggest winners and losers in Trump’s budget blueprint:\n\nWinners\n\nDepartment of Defense – 10% increase. As part of Trump’s call to rebuild the U.S. military from stem to stern, the president is seeking a base budget of $574 billion in fiscal 2018, up $53 billion from the current year. The administration is also seeking an additional $65 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security – 6.8% increase. With a major focus on border security and cracking down and deporting illegal immigrants, Trump has requested $44.1 billion in the coming year, an increase of $2.8 billion. The department will hire 500 new border patrol agents and 1,000 new immigration and customs agents. It will also begin planning for construction of a nearly 2,000-mile wall along the southern border.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs – 6% increase. Trump complained that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to help veterans receive adequate health care coverage and benefits. He is requesting $78.9 billion, or $4.4 billion more than the current level. He is also seeking $3.5 billion to fund the Veterans Choice Program to assure veterans can obtain prompt medical services.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration – 11.3% increase. The Energy Department has major responsibility for the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. Trump is seeking $13.9 billion, or $1.4 billion more than this year. The administration wants to revive the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada.\n\n\n\nSocial Security Administration –0.2% increase. Few tasks are more politically important than getting out Social Security checks on time. But Trump’s budget is so tight outside of spending on national security and defense matters that the Social Security Administration was lucky to escape with a minuscule increase. The president has requested $9.3 billion, just a fraction more than this year’s spending level.\n\nLosers\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency – 31% decrease. Trump campaigned vowing to dismantle the EPA and its climate change regulations that have adversely impacted the coal industry and energy production. The EPA is being hammered more than any other agency and would receive only $5.7 billion, down $2.6 billion from this year. Trump would eliminate more than 50 programs and 3,200 jobs.\n\n\n\nDepartment of State and USAID – 29% decrease. The administration insists that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shouldn’t take it personally, but it may be hard for the former ExxonMobil CEO to swallow this humiliating cut. The White House budget office says the lion’s share of the cuts will be in foreign aid, with only a small part related to diplomacy. But there would also be sharp reductions in UN peacekeeping activities and climate change programs. Trump is asking for $25.6 billion, down $10.1 billion from this year.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Agriculture – 21% decrease. Looks like farmers aren’t among Trump’s favorites. The president has requested $17.9 billion, down $4.7 billion this year.\n\n\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services—18% decrease. HHS is in the cross hairs of the Trump administration because it has been responsible for running the Obamacare program and other health care policies. Trump requested $69 billion, down $15.1 billion from this year. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is part of HHS would lose $5.8 billion for research grants. Department of Housing and Urban Development – 13.2% decrease. Trump repeatedly voiced concern about the plight of blacks in decaying and crime-ridden urban areas, but that wasn’t reflected in his budget request that would result in deep cuts in housing vouchers and community development programs. Trump requested $40.7 billion, down $6.2 billion of this year.\n\nThere are plenty of other casualties in the Trump budget. For example, the administration is seeking to eliminate funding for nearly 20 other long-standing and popular programs, including the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation."

    "text": "The vice-chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. floated a plan earlier this week that would require big banks to separate their commercial and investment arms — essentially a return to the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that for decades kept the Citibanks of the world walled off from the securities business.\n\nThe FDIC’s Thomas Hoenig said in a speech to the Institute of International Bankers that investment activities and commercial banking, such as holding deposits and lending to consumers, should be handled by distinct units. In exchange, big banks would get looser capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump often promised a return to Glass-Steagall and in a last-minute change last July, that position was inserted into the Republican Party platform, surprising many. At a press briefing last Thursday, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in response to a question that the administration remains committed to restoring Glass-Steagall.\n\nStill, with so many former Wall Street players holding top positions in the Trump administration, any new iteration of Glass-Steagall would seem like a non-starter.\n\nRelated: Trump Calls for '21st Century' Glass-Steagall Banking Law\n\nBut there are several factors that could make a “Glass-Steagall for the 21st Century” — which Trump called for last October and which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said at his confirmation hearing should be considered — more of a possibility.\n\nFirst, most of the Wall Streeters in the Cabinet or other positions of power — such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — do not come from the big commercial banks but from investment banks, which might actually benefit from not having behemoths such as Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo playing in their sand box.\n\nIn what may have been a telling moment, Mnuchin told the Senate that the Volcker Rule, a component of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act that restricts speculative investments by banks, should apply only to banks that benefit “from federal deposit insurance.\" That means big commercial banks and investment banks that also offer customers some commercial banking functions.\n\nIn addition, Trump confidant and early supporter Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, called for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall in a 2014 interview with Fox News.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason that the Trump administration could embrace a version of Glass-Steagall is influential adviser Steve Bannon. In a Wall Street Journal profile on Tuesday, the self-described economic nationalist talked about how the nest-egg losses his father suffered during the financial crisis of 2008 have informed his outlook. “Everything since then has come from there. All of it,” he said.\n\nAnd in a video discussion at the 2014 annual conference of the Rome-based Human Dignity Institute, Bannon talked about a “crisis in capitalism” and complained that no one had been jailed because of the financial crisis. He said the big bank “bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn’t make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people — by the way…people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the finest institutions in the West. They should have known better.”\n\nBannon said that seeing “all the upside [go] to the hedge funds and the investment bank[s] and to the crony capitalist[s] with stock increases and bonus increases” was part of what was fueling a populist uprising.\n\nA November 2016 Journal story said that Bannon’s remarks suggested an endorsement of Glass-Steagall, though it remains unclear if he still holds those views. Still, Bannon ran Breibart News until he joined the Trump campaign late last summer, and during his tenure the right-wing news site on more than one occasion called for a return to Glass-Steagall.\n\nTrump wasn’t the only candidate to call for a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall during last year’s election campaign; Democrat Bernie Sanders did, too. Both pointed out that the barriers between commercial and investment banks were broken down by legislation signed by former President Bill Clinton in 1999 — a clear jab at Hillary Clinton — and suggested that rolling back Glass-Steagall helped bring on the financial crisis, though economists and regulation experts are divided about its impact.\n\nRelated: Bill Clinton Still Can’t Fess Up to One of His Biggest Blunders\n\nIn a story last August, The Atlantic laid out the wide range of views. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote: “I’ve…heard bank executives claim there’s no reason to resurrect Glass-Steagall because none of the big banks actually failed. This is like arguing lifeguards are no longer necessary at beaches where no one has drowned.”\n\nBut John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute had a vastly different position. “Since Glass-Steagall forbade ‘Main Street’ commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, it actually protected Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs from competition, enabling them to get bigger.… And in the end, it was pure investment banks such as Bear and Lehman Brothers — neither of which had merged with commercial banks — that were the first dominoes to fall in the financial crisis.”\n\nReinstating the original structure of Glass-Steagall is probably not in the cards. Mnuchin said in January that “Separating out banks and investment banks right now…would have very big implications,” including, as Bloomberg noted, “potentially hurting liquidity, the capital markets and lending.” But he did endorse looking at new ways to wall off bank risk.\n\nToday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she had seen no concrete proposals and didn’t know what a modern-day Glass-Steagall would look like. She also said: “I don’t think [rolling back Glass-Steagall] was the cause of the financial crisis,” adding that bank holding companies have been strengthened since the crisis and investment banking activities are now more appropriately capitalized. “But,” Yellen said, “obviously we would look at any proposals.”\n\nOne other thing might give the president pause: Two of his arch-enemies from both sides of the aisle, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Republican Senator John McCain have jointly proposed an update to Glass-Steagall.\n\nIf Bannon were to pick this fight, he would have allies — but also heavy resistance."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/16/How-Republicans-Got-Trapped-Their-Health-Care-Promises",
    "text": "During the election campaign in 2015 and 2016, Donald Trump repeatedly insisted that he didn’t want anything to do with entitlement reform. Even while promising to repeal Obamacare and Medicaid expansion, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, Trump promised not to touch Medicare or Social Security.\n\n“I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,” Trump told David Brody in May 2015. Since then, he has remained steadfast on that promise, even as Republican leadership insists they can convince him to take on the challenge of entitlement reform during the next three years.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nAfter seeing the reaction from some Republicans to just a return of Medicaid to the status quo ante of 2009, Trump looks wise indeed to kick that can down the road. Rather than offer an honest assessment of the consequences of rolling back a costly and unsupportable mandate, everyone tried to promise nothing would change – and then got trapped by reality.\n\nBefore Monday’s score from the Congressional Budget Office, Republican leadership on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue argued that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would not leave any Americans in the lurch. In an op-ed for USA Today last week, Speaker Paul Ryan assured readers that they would have a stable transition.\n\n“As we move from a Washington-driven system to a more vibrant market,” Ryan wrote, “we will make sure no one will have the rug pulled out from under them.” The day before the score came out, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price went even further. Price told NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that “nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we’re going through.”\n\nThe next day, the CBO released its analysis of the AHCA, and it made clear that some Americans will face negative impacts from the AHCA. In the first year of Obamacare repeal, CBO estimates that there will be 14 million more uninsured than under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – but those will result from the end of mandates that force people to buy insurance. By 2020, though, the Medicaid expansion in the ACA will end, and current and projected recipients on that safety-net program will comprise the bulk of the 24 million more Americans expected to be without insurance by 2026.\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\nThe next day, Republicans tried pushing back on the CBO’s figures – but mainly avoided the Medicaid changes. Ryan told Fox News that he was “encouraged” by the CBO report, but that “they sort of overestimate the uninsured number.” Price said the administration’s analysts “disagree strenuously with the report that was put out.”\n\nOMB director Mick Mulvaney stressed on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that the CBO missed widely on its estimates for enrollment in Obamacare, saying, “I don’t believe the facts are correct.” When Kasie Hunt challenged Mulvaney on the Medicaid rollback, he fell back on the private-market argument about those “who have coverage but don’t have care,” an argument that does not apply to Medicaid, as the rollback does nothing to improve access to those on the entitlement program.\n\nAll of this dances around a very clear reality: the Medicaid rollback will impact several million Americans who gained this benefit in the ACA. The impact of an Obamacare repeal on Medicaid should come as no surprise; indeed, Republicans have advocated repeal for the last seven years ever since Congress passed Obamacare, and that always included returning Medicaid to its 2009 parameters. Republicans set up a false expectation of zero impact, and now are blaming the CBO for reporting the obvious.\n\nIn fact, they are stepping on what should be an overall positive message. Despite gloom-and-doom predictions from Democrats, the CBO concluded that the AHCA will not destabilize insurer markets, and will eventually begin to bring premium prices back down as coverage alternatives and rational risk allocation return. It cuts $1.2 trillion in taxes while reducing deficit spending by $337 billion – a remarkable combination.\n\nRelated: Scrambling to Save Their Health Plan, Republicans Consider a Major Change\n\nAs Avik Roy points out at Forbes, the CBO’s analysis doesn’t even address “the macroeconomic effects that those tax cuts would have on economic growth, and thereby on greater tax revenues.” Nor does it address the potential for wage and employment growth with the elimination of employer mandates, employment caps on their enforcement, and full-time work requirements.\n\nThe flustered, unprepared, and arguably disingenuous response from Republicans this week does not bode well for future efforts on serious entitlement reform. The tens of trillions in unfunded mandates that will eventually bury the US economy and impose crippling debt do not result from offering too few benefits from these programs; those burdens result from too much expansion of entitlements, both in breadth and scope.\n\nAt some point, entitlement reform means restricting benefits, delaying eligibility, and increasing contributions in some combination. There are no end games to fiscal solvency for these programs that keep all their current promises and obligations. One way or another, bad news will be part of the effort, even while necessary to prevent much worse news.\n\nAny serious effort will require brutal honesty, courageous leadership, and a shared sense of fiscal crisis between those who govern and are governed, but it starts with the latter being forthright with the former. This week hasn’t given much reason for confidence in the ability of reformers to deliver on any of those necessary qualities."

    "text": "President Trump will formally unveil a budget plan on Thursday that makes good on his campaign pledges to rebuild the military, crack down on illegal immigrants, and construct a wall along the southern border with Mexico while slashing spending on foreign aid, environmental enforcement and scores of other domestic programs he derided throughout the 2016 campaign.\n\n“This is the ‘America First’ budget,” White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday, invoking Trump’s signature campaign theme while asserting that the budget document directly reflects the priorities Trump established on the campaign trail. “There’s no question this is a hard-power budget, it is not a soft-power budget, Mulvaney said.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nTrump’s fiscal 2017 and 2018 budget blueprint – which is subject to congressional approval -- would boost defense spending this year by an additional $30 billion and by another $54 billion in the fiscal year that begins next October 1 – a roughly 10 percent increase.\n\nThe budget would also shower the Department of Homeland Security and immigration and border patrol agencies with billions of fresh dollars aimed at stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the country and blocking the flow of refugees from the Middle East and other countries. The budget also makes the first down payments on the cost of building a wall along the border with Mexico. That will begin with a relatively modest $1.5 billion appropriation this year, a small fraction of the estimated $25 billion overall cost that was Trump said would be paid by Mexico.\n\nThat would be followed by an additional $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, to provide the administration with time and resources to design the wall and set a construction timeline for arguably Trump’s most expensive and controversial infrastructure project.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Trump is proposing a series of deep cuts in other programs to offset the cost of his national defense and homeland security efforts and to begin to whittle away at what the president insists is a bloated and entrenched federal workforce. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s White House senior adviser, has boasted that Trump would lead a “deconstruction of the administrative state,” and the president’s budget seeks to make good on that boast.\n\nAmong programs targeted for deep cuts or elimination: The Corporation for Public Television, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, with public television funding slated to be zeroed out.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, which led the Obama administration drive to combat climate change, would see its budget cut by 31 percent, or roughly $2 billion, which would force the layoffs of about 3,000 employees. The administration will also seek $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a move that would greatly diminish public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants.\n\nOne of the deepest cuts of 28 percent would be made in the State Department – a jarring setback for Trump’s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chairman and CEO. Mulvaney insisted yesterday that this in no way reflected the president’s view of Tillerson’s performance and that the bulk of the savings would come from the foreign aid program.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nWhile bulking up spending on defense, homeland and border security, veterans’ benefits, law enforcement and private and public school choice, the administration pursued dollar-for-dollar offsetting cuts in domestic programs that were given a low priority by the new president.\n\nMulvaney recently revealed that Trump’s 2018 budget “blueprint” would allocate $603 billion towards “top line defense discretionary” funding, or a $54 billion increase over the Budget Control Act spending caps. Yesterday Mulvaney said the administration would seek $30 billion more for defense and border security this year as part of an unfinished fiscal 2017 appropriations package.\n\nHe said the budget would fund the Pentagon’s needs “in a responsible fashion in terms of what they can actually spend this year.”\n\nThe so-called preliminary “skinny budget” is missing many crucial details that won’t be known until later this spring, including overall projected spending, revenues, interest on the debt and the fate of major entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other costly entitlement programs that are the biggest drivers of government spending and debt.\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nThe federal government is currently projected to spend a little more than $4 trillion next year, with roughly two-thirds going to Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements and interest on the nearly $20 trillion national debt. The Congressional Budget Office currently forecasts that fiscal 2018 spending will exceed revenues by $488 billion, more deficit that will be piled onto the debt.\n\nDespite his frequent promises to address the rising deficit and debt, Trump’s new budget plan does nothing to shrink the deficit next year. If anything, his drive for major tax cuts for businesses and individuals, new infrastructure construction including the southern wall, expanded access to charter schools and other initiatives will likely drive up the debt even more.\n\n“This is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget,” Mulvaney said, which focuses almost exclusively on the roughly one-third of the budget consumed by discretionary spending. “And anybody who looks at the deficit and knows the issues of the deficit knows you cannot balance the deficit in the discretionary budget.”\n\nMoreover, there is considerable uncertainty over whether Trump and congressional Republican leaders will make good on their campaign pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and what impact that will have on millions of Americans reliant on Obamacare’s subsidized private insurance policies and expanded Medicaid for their coverage.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nHowever, critics say that even with only sketchy information about Trump’s intention to effectively shred social safety net programs while escalating defense spending well above the legal discretionary spending caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act, the new administration appears bent on imposing devastating cuts to domestic social programs that have long enjoyed bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.\n\nNon-defense discretionary spending on such things as education, job training, research and development as well as operating costs for federal agencies already have been reduced significantly since 2010 under the Budget Control Act and would have been deeper if it hadn’t been for the intervention of Congress, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nUnder existing law, non-defense discretionary spending is due to fall 16 percent below its 2010 level in 2018. If Trump prevails with his budget proposal, the cut will deepen to 25 percent. Trump has vowed not to cut Medicare or Social Security as part of his efforts to restrain spending – at least for the time being. That will put even more pressure on his policy advisers and cabinet members to find additional savings in domestic programs which constitute about a third of the overall federal budget, including food stamps and welfare assistance.\n\nRobert Greenstein, president of the center, told reporters yesterday that “the emerging Trump fiscal policy agenda appears to harm many of the very people who the president said during his campaign would be a priority for him and his administration – namely low and middle-income families that have struggled with stagnant or declining incomes.”\n\n“And those people would be harmed even as other parts of the fiscal policy agenda confer very large new tax cuts on people at the top of the income scale,” he added. “Indeed, the indications are mounting that when we get the full Trump budget, it may well represent the most aggressive, Robin-Hood-in-reverse budget proposal by any president in modern U.S. history.”"

    "text": "For the past week, the question swirling around the House Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act has been whether or not the GOP leadership could produce enough votes to pass the bill on the floor of the House. But a surprise announcement on Wednesday by a rising figure on the conservative right wing of the party raised the possibility that the bill might not even make it there in the first place.\n\nVirginia Rep. Dave Brat, who rose to prominence by defeating the incumbent House Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, in a primary election in 2014, said that he will not support the House leadership-proposed American Health Care Act when it comes up for a vote in the House Budget Committee. Brat is one of three members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus who sit on the Budget Committee, and if he turns out to be a bellwether for the votes of the other two -- South Carolina’s Mark Sanford and Alabama’s Gary Palmer -- the GOP would find itself in a perilous spot.\n\nRelated: Scrambling to Save Their Health Plan, Republicans Consider a Major Change\n\nRepublicans have a large advantage in numbers on the committee, with 22 votes to the Democrats’ 14, but the Democrats are expected to unanimously oppose the bill, meaning that if the GOP loses all three Freedom Caucus members, it would take only one more Republican defector to deprive the party of a majority.\n\nThe Budget Committee would be an ironic place for the AHCA to die, given that the entire Republican plan is premised on the idea of using a budget reconciliation measure to hustle the legislation through the Senate, where it would not be subject to the filibuster.\n\nThe role of the Budget Committee in the process was not expected to be significant -- the members will not be permitted to offer amendments. They were expected to meld versions of the bill that came out of the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees and forward the result to the Rules Committee to set up a vote on final passage.\n\nBut Brat’s public defiance of House leadership comes at a time when opposition to the AHCA bill is growing among both conservatives and what remains of the moderate faction of the GOP, though for different reasons.\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\nBrat is a Ph.D. economist popular with the Tea Party, who taught and Randolph-Macon College outside Richmond before running for office. He said that he objects to the House leadership’s refusal to entertain amendments to the bill, and that he can’t accept a “repeal” of the Affordable Care Act that doesn’t eliminate new regulations that the law placed on the health insurance industry.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, it was unclear where the other Freedom Caucus members on the Budget Committee stood on the bill."

    "text": "The proposed border adjustment tax has been dividing U.S. lawmakers. It is also dividing companies into those who support it and those who do not, as the simplified theory of the proposal – tax imports and exempt export revenue from taxable income – is expected to create clear-cut winners and losers among U.S. businesses.\n\nIt is also dividing the U.S. states into two groups: states that are expected to benefit, and states who stand to lose from the tax plan. The state of Texas and its economy are expected to be on the losers’ end should the border tax pass as-is, even though the probability of the plan passing all legislative vetting is not considered to be very high.\n\nRelated: Why Ryan’s ‘Border Adjustment’ Import Tax Is So Controversial\n\nBecause of its physical location, adjacent to Mexico, along with its vast energy industry, Texas’ economy is a global one. Texas is the home of energy giants ExxonMobil, Valero Energy, and Phillips 66, just to name a few. In the border adjustment plan, U.S. refiners who import oil stand to lose.\n\nAccording to The Dallas Morning News contributor Richard Parker – who is also the author of ‘Lone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America’ – the border tax plan would basically transfer around $1 trillion from the companies importing goods in the big importing states to the less competitive Midwest. And Texas, being one of the top international trading and importing states alongside California, Florida and New York, would likely lose.\n\nTexas has a gross state product of nearly $1.6 trillion, and its international trade portfolio is almost evenly balanced; that is, the value of exports and the value of imports are very close in terms of dollar figures.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, state exports from Texas stood at $232.6 billion in 2016, accounting for 16 percent of all U.S. exports last year. State imports for Texas were $229.3 billion in value last year. The no.1 import commodity was crude oil. The no.1 and no.2 export commodities were also oil products. Mexico is Texas’ no.1 trade partner, both in exports and imports. Oil companies and refiners in Texas are importing crude oil, including heavy crude from Mexico. The border tax would be a hit to their business, because even if they wanted to switch to buying American-only crude oil, it is light crude and not suited for all kinds of refining processes and products.\n\nRelated: Republican defends border-adjustment tax after Trump criticism\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, criticized the border adjustment tax at the end of January.\n\n“The United States imports into our refineries a lot of the heavy crude that our refineries are outfitted to deal with. Those would all be subject to the tax. One refiner told me that they thought that might increase the cost of gasoline by 30 cents. I want to make sure we know what the consequences would be and exactly how this would work,” Cornyn said. He stressed that he supports a tax overhaul that would spur economic growth, but called for further discussion on the border tax consequences for U.S. companies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, Cornyn said, as quoted by Bloomberg:\n\n“The hard reality is the border tax is on life support, and given the imperative of 51 senators and 218 House members and one president, I think we need to look for other options.”\n\n\n\nPresident Trump, who had initially criticized the border tax proposal, calling it “too complicated”, seems to have been warming to the plan, telling Reuters at the end of February that the tax plan could boost U.S. exports and job creation, but stopped just shy of endorsing it.\n\nShould the border tax pass as-is (currently not a very likely scenario), many companies relying on imports, such as retailers and refiners processing foreign oil, could take a hit, as could a globalized and foreign trading economy such as Texas.\n\nThis article originally appeared in OilPrice.com.

    "text": "The Federal Reserve just raised interest rates for the second time in three months, signaling a dramatic quickening of its prior pace.\n\nFor the first time in more than a decade, Fed policymakers are turning increasingly hawkish out of concern over ongoing labor market tightening, evidence of building inflationary pressure and the surge of business, consumer and investor sentiment following the surprise election of President Donald Trump.\n\nThis hawkish turn — a typical late-cycle move by central banks — is made unique by the fact that Wall Street has surged in recent years thanks to an unprecedented monetary stimulus. Never in recorded human history have interest rates been as low as they've been in recent years.\n\nRelated: Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump\n\nHigher interest rates nearly always result in recession and bear markets (with only a few \"soft landings\" the exception). But now, with asset valuations across the spectrum stretching into questionable territory even as price volatility remains extremely low, one wonders: Will this Fed tightening result in something much worse?\n\nNearly every segment of the market is expensive. U.S. equity valuations have only been higher during the run-up to the 1929 and 2000 market crashes. Bond yields remain low and bond spreads remain compressed. Commodity prices have rebounded from their early 2016 lows.\n\nBut vulnerabilities are appearing. Crude oil is sliding further below the $50-a-barrel threshold as inventory and oversupply concerns reappear. High-yield corporate bonds are selling off in sympathy, as investors once again worry about the solvency of high-cost U.S. shale producers.\n\nRelated: Why Oil Prices Are Tanking — and Where They’re Headed Next\n\nA turnabout, if that's what this is, is in a very early state: The Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield B Effective Yield stands at 6 percent, up from a post-election low of 5.5 percent but well off the high of 10.2 percent hit in February 2016 as energy prices were bombing out.\n\nYet Wall Street is beginning to sound the alarm as inflation heats up. On Tuesday, the latest producer price inflation data showed inflation is running at its fastest pace in five years. Consumer price inflation has also been on the rise, driven by higher shelter costs, among other things.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients last weekend that investors \"will soon capitulate on their expectation of upside\" to their earnings growth forecasts for the year. Part of the reason is that the tax cuts expected from the Trump administration are increasingly unlikely to occur before 2018.\n\nRelated: Americans’ Household Wealth Hits a New High\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Kostin expanded upon this outlook by downgrading equities outright. He warned that, with \"growth momentum nearing its peak and rates increasing further with a hawkish Fed,\" the balance of risk for investors looks increasingly negative. The risk is made worse by elevated valuation levels, which as noted in the chart below, have historically led to larger and more painful selloffs.\n\nGoldman economists have penciled in three rate hikes for 2017, to come in March, June and September. They also expect the Fed to start its balance-sheet normalization — that is, the process of reversing the heavy bond-buying done under the QE1, QE2 and QE3 programs — sometime in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestors are ill prepared for a big breakout in volatility, as large-cap stocks have now gone more than 100 days without even so much as a 1 percent selloff. That's the longest streak of calm since 1995. It can’t last forever.\n\nAnthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge (ETFs) and Edge Pro (Options) investment advisory newsletters.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Scrambling-Save-Their-Health-Plan-Republicans-Consider-Major-Change",
    "text": "In their struggle to find a way to make both hard-right conservatives and more middle-of-the-road members of their party line up behind their health insurance bill, Republican leaders are reportedly considering the abandonment of a key element of the proposal.\n\nThe American Health Care Act has a “continuous coverage” provision that is meant to create an incentive for healthy people to sign up for insurance, even if the odds are that they won’t have any major medical expenses in the near future. The provision allows insurers to add a 30 percent premium surcharge on policies for people who go without insurance for 63 days or more. The penalty would last for 12 months.\n\nRelated: Why the House GOP Health Care Replacement Plan Is Collapsing\n\nNow, according to the news website Axios, GOP leaders in the House are saying they might jettison the requirement in order to gain more support for the bill.\n\nIn one sense, this is easy to understand. The requirement is easily the most unpopular element of the proposed law, according to a poll out Wednesday morning from Morning Consult and Politico. Sixty-four percent of Americans said that they objected to the 30 percent penalty, while only 18 percent said they approved.\n\nIn another sense, though, abandoning the coverage requirement is something like actuarial suicide.\n\nThe whole point of the requirement was to help stabilize insurance markets if the GOP is successful in repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance or to pay a penalty. The mandate was put in place because a successful insurance market requires that relatively healthy people be willing to purchase insurance even though they probably won’t need all of its benefits. By doing so, they effectively subsidize sicker people who use more services.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would Devastate Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nThe reason the Republican plan contained the continuous coverage requirement was precisely to avoid what’s known as the “free-rider” problem: a situation where no healthy people bother to sign up for insurance until they need it, which would ensure that the pool of policyholders is predominantly made up of people who are already sick.\n\nPlenty of experts pointed out that a 30 percent penalty for a year probably wasn’t sufficient incentive to entice many healthy people to buy insurance in the first place, but eliminating it entirely virtually guarantees an insurance market that is built either to fail or to generate skyrocketing prices for coverage.\n\nThat’s because as insurers realize that their customers are, on average, beginning to cost them more, they will begin raising prices. And because of the ACA’s coverage guarantees, which the Republican plan keeps in place, those price increases can’t be targeted at specific high-cost individuals, but must be the same for people across broad age ranges.\n\nAs a result, rising premiums create even greater disincentives for healthy people to opt out of coverage, potentially creating a spiral of cost increases and dropped policies that harms virtually everyone. If the AHCA was a hard sell for House leadership confronting skeptical health care establishment before, a version without the continuous care requirement would be even worse."

    "text": "Support for the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act is collapsing quickly in the House, where both conservative and moderate Republicans have been stunned by a Congressional Budget Office forecast that as many as 24 million Americans could lose their insurance coverage over the coming decade.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and the Trump administration continue to press for approval of the Republican replacement plan in the House in the coming weeks, despite mounting warnings that it has no chance of winning approval once it reaches the Senate without a major overhaul.\n\nRelated: How Health Care Is Crippling the Speaker of the House\n\nBut many Republicans are bridling at this, fearing that a vote on an increasingly unpopular health care plan with no prospects for ultimate passage will cost them dearly in the 2018 mid-term elections when their party could risk losing the gains in the last November election.\n\nThat’s what happened to the Democrats in 1993 when President Clinton and House Democrats pushed through a deficit reduction bill with an energy tax increase that died in the Senate. Many of those House Dems lost their seats, and pundits said they’d been “BTUed.”\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would ‘Devastate’ Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nWith prominent Republican senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina warning that the legislation would be “dead on arrival” in the Senate, many moderate and conservative House Republicans have begun to oppose the GOP plan.\n\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said on Tuesday that she won’t support the plan because of the high number of people projected to lose expanded Medicaid coverage. “As written the plan leaves too many from my #SoFla district uninsured,” she tweeted. “Need a plan that would do more to protect them.”\n\nRep. Leonard Lance, a moderate Republican from New Jersey who some view as vulnerable in the 2018 mid-term election, told reporters, “I do not want to vote on a bill that has no chance of passing over in the Senate. The CBO score has modified the dynamics.”\n\nIn the wake of the CBO analysis of the GOP replacement plan on Monday showing major long-term savings and stabilizing of premiums but a massive loss in the number of uninsured Americans, the Republican plan itself appears to be collapsing of its own weight. Conservatives complain that the plan doesn’t go far enough in wiping out Obamacare mandates and policies, dismissing it as “Obamacare Lite.” More moderate Republicans fear the plan goes too far by phasing out expanded Medicaid benefits and providing inadequate premium subsidies and other assistance to low and moderate-income Americans.\n\nRelated: GOP Replacement Plan Could Send Hospital Costs Soaring Again\n\nWith sharp criticism of the plan now coming from both the conservative and more moderate wings of the party in both the House and Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and other administration officials scrambled yesterday to salvage the plan.\n\nIt’s not what Ryan and the Trump administration want to hear, but many uneasy Senate Republicans yesterday advised the speaker and White House officials to go back to the drawing board and make significant changes.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the Senate Republicans want to see a plan that would result in lower insurance costs for poorer, older Americans, and an increase in funding in states with large numbers of hard-to-insure people. Others are alarmed by how many of their constituents would lose Medicaid coverage under the GOP approach and are looking for reassurances that vulnerable beneficiaries won’t have the rug pulled out from under them.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan -- Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nLast week, Ryan outlined a three-step process for repealing and replacing Obamacare, that begins with passage of the American Health Care Act in the coming weeks with the help of special budget rules called reconciliation. Then, HHS secretary Price would take administrative action to deregulate the Obamacare marketplace. And third, Congress would have to pass additional legislation to encourage the sale of health care policies across state lines.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly referred to this “three-prong” approach during a briefing on Tuesday, arguing that CBO’s projections of millions losing their insurance failed to account for all three of these steps.\n\nBut Cotton, a leading critic of the House approach, said dismissively during a recent interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt that: “There is no three-step plan. That is just political talk. It’s just politicians engaging in spin.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Can-Ivanka-Trump-Save-World-Her-Father",
    "text": "If the world stands any chance of surviving the worst effects of global warming, it may take the stubborn intervention of First Daughter Ivanka Trump to blunt the worst instincts of her father’s administration.\n\nTrump, the glamorous New York fashion designer, is not officially a member of the Trump White House like her husband, Jared Kushner. But she has informally served as one of the few voices of reason on climate change within a new Republican administration populated with a few key climate change skeptics. And that begins with President Trump himself who once called climate change a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese.\n\nRelated: The Senate Just Confirmed the EPA’s Arch Enemy to Run the Agency\n\nHer efforts are noble in the eyes of many environmentalists, and she has the advantage of being her father’s favorite child. But if the latest reports of environmental disregard within the Trump administration are true, then her prospects for success are slim indeed.\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday that Trump is preparing to sign a set of “sweeping directives” to dramatically reduce the role that climate change plays in a wide range of government decisions, from creating appliance standards to the approval of new pipeline construction like the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\nThese new orders would go well beyond a targeted attack on Obama administration measures blocking coal leasing and curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the report says. The new presidential order would also override the government’s use of a metric known as “the social cost of carbon” which attempts to quantify the social cost of carbon.\n\nBloomberg also reports the order would eliminate industry restrictions on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe Climate Change Crisis Trump Refuses to Acknowledge\n\nIvanka Trump does have two powerful allies within the cabinet. Defense Secretary General James Mattis considers climate change real and a threat to U.S. national security. He wants to see a reduction in fossil fuels for the armed forces in order to keep them mobile and sustainable. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is vigorously arguing against fulfilling the president’s campaign pledge to cancel the 2015 Paris accord that binds most countries to curb global warming, as The New York Times recently reported.\n\nThe Obama administration pledged that the U.S. would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Ivanka Trump and Tillerson reportedly fear that pulling out of the landmark climate agreement could have “broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications,” not to mention undermining what former President Obama deemed the “last best hope” to save the planet.\n\nBut other powerful forces in the White House, including the senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon, are pressing for President Trump to disavow the international agreement signed by 194 nations. If the U.S. –- the largest economy in the world and the second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions next to China -- were to gradually pull out, experts say it would do incalculable damage to the international agreement.\n\nRelated: Obama--This May Be ‘The Last Generation’ That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nAl Gore, who met with both President Trump and Ivanka at Trump Tower last December, told The Washington Post Tuesday that he thinks “there is a realistic chance” the president will opt to keep the United States as a participant in the Paris accord.\n\nBut more generally, Ivanka is probably fighting a losing cause within an administration that is sworn to helping the coal industry make an improbable comeback and turning back the clock on thousands of industry and environmental regulations geared to trying to reduce global warming.\n\nHer father has stacked the deck against her, choosing, for instance, former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and preside over the dismantling of every facet of Obama’s policies to crack down on carbon emissions from aging coal-fired power plants.\n\nTrump recently signed one of his many executive orders directing Pruitt to begin the lengthy legal process of repealing the EPA’s Clean Power Plan for cutting power plant pollutions. Those regulations were at the heart of the Obama administration’s commitment to meeting U.S. obligations under the Paris accord.\n\nRelated: EPA Chief’s Magical Thinking: Push Energy Production and Protect the Planet\n\nPruitt and other attorneys general from coal and energy producing states vigorously fought those regulations in federal court for a year, and now Pruitt can begin to throttle them from with the very agency he has been battling with for years.\n\nPruitt sought to reassure scientists and environmentalists at the EPA that he would be evenhanded in his oversight of the federal agency entrusted with protecting the nation’s air and water quality. He vowed to do as much to promote energy production and jobs as he would protect the environment.\n\nWithin days of taking charge of the EPA, he shocked many of his employees and the international environmental community by declaring that he didn’t believe there was a direct relationship between industrial carbon emissions and global warming – essentially disputing decades of scientific research to the contrary.\n\n“I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt told CNBC a week ago. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Trump-s-Tax-Return-Offers-Little-Substantive-Information",
    "text": "The supposed bombshell release of President Trump’s 2005 tax return on Tuesday night was more of a firecracker. After much hype and a 20-minute delay that made the program feel more like a reality television show than a commentary on the news, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow revealed that through veteran reporter David Cay Johnston, she had acquired the first two pages of Trump’s form 1040 for tax year 2005.\n\nThe document shows that Trump paid about $38 million in income tax that year, on income of close to $150 million, after a massive write-off of $103 million in business losses. Johnston said that he had received the documents “over the transom” and that he had not solicited them, nor did he know who had mailed them to him.\n\nRelated: The 20 Richest People in the World\n\nDespite the hype on MSNBC Tuesday night, though, the documents answer almost none of the real questions that have been driving people to demand that Trump, like presidents before him back to the 1970s, releases his tax returns to the public. Among them: Does Trump have significant business ties to Russia, or to other foreign governments that could create conflicts of interest as he pursues US policy overseas?\n\nThe problem is that for a return as complicated as Trump’s no doubt is, looking at the first two pages is equivalent to reading the front and back covers of a book and ignoring the hundreds of pages in between. It gives you a general idea of what’s going on but is woefully short on details.\n\nFor example, take Line 12 on the 1040 where Trump reports $42,395,804 in business income for the year. Yes, we now know a little more about Trump’s finances, specifically that he pulled down more than $42 million from the operation of various businesses. But we have no idea which of his many businesses generated all that income, or how. Much of that information would be contained on the IRS Schedule C that was presumably filed with the return, but which was not included in the documents Johnston received.\n\nOr look at Line 17, on which Trump reported $67,383,658 in income from “rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc.” We get the bottom line number, but not the breakdown of what exactly those partnerships and trusts look like, where they are located, and who Trump may be doing business with. All that would be detailed on IRS Schedule E which, conveniently, wasn’t part of the package either.\n\nRelated: Why So Many CEOs Are Cozying Up to Trump\n\nThere is also no detail about the more than $9 million in interest payments Trump received in 2005 or the more than $32 million in capital gains he realized during the year.\n\nThe biggest mystery the release of those two sheets of paper solves is the question of whether Trump paid any taxes at all in the years after a filing in 1995 in which he reported a loss of nearly $1 billion. That loss made it theoretically possible that using IRS rules that allow losses to be carried forward, Trump could have paid no taxes for up to 18 years.\n\nIt turns out that wasn’t true, at least in 2005, but that’s about the only revelatory part of the documents.\n\nJohnston seemed to acknowledge as much when he pointed out early in his appearance on Maddow’s show that he couldn’t discount the possibility that Trump himself had caused the documents to be leaked, citing Trump’s history of such activity during his years as a tabloid-obsessed Manhattan real estate developer.\n\nRelated: The Best Ways to Use Your Tax Refund – and the Worst\n\nIndeed, much of the speculation surrounding the unexpected appearance of the documents Tuesday was focused on the idea that it was an attempt by Trump or his supporters to distract attention from the other story dominating the news: the damaging report by the Congressional Budget Office that found the health care bill proposed by House Republicans and backed by Trump, would cost 24 million Americans their health insurance.\n\nRegardless of where the documents came from, the White House made a show of righteous indignation. On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted, “Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \"went to his mailbox\" and found my tax returns? @NBCNews FAKE NEWS!”\n\n(For the record, Johnston was a longtime reporter on tax issues for The New York Times and is a Pulitzer Prize winner. People have, in fact, heard of him.)\n\nOn Tuesday night, the White House released a statement blasting MSNBC and Johnston.\n\n“You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected president, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\n\nRelated: Leave More Time for Your Financial Aid Form This Year as IRS Shuts Down FAFSA Data Tool\n\n“That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large-scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.”\n\nInterestingly, the Trump administration’s decision to bring up the president’s tax reform plan in the statement calls attention to one more interesting fact revealed by the return. Trump’s effective tax rate in 2005 was a little more than 25 percent. But the only reason he paid as much as he did is that he was subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, designed to assure that the very wealthy pay some taxes even if their income and deductions are structured in a way to avoid all tax liability.\n\nTrump’s tax proposals include the elimination of the AMT."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/15/Trump-s-Government-Reorganization-Hatchet-Job-or-Just-Major-Surgery",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s habit of appointing people to run federal agencies who have a history of very public antipathy toward those same agencies has caused many good government advocates to throw up their hands in dismay. And White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon’s claim that the administration’s goal is a dismantling of the regulatory state has likewise created a lot of heartburn for people who believe that a strong, functional federal government is essential to the success of the country.\n\nHowever, an executive order signed by the president yesterday is giving some hope to people who simultaneously believe that, yes, the federal government needs to be healthy and functional, but that it could also do with a strong dose of reform.\n\nRelated: Now It’s the Democrats’ Turn to Threaten a Government Shutdown\n\nThe order, billed as a “Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch,” gives the heads of every federal agency 180 days to submit to the White House Office of Management and Budget “a plan to reorganize the agency, if appropriate, in order to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of that agency.”\n\nSix months later, the OMB director is expected to deliver a plan to “reorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies...components of agencies, and agency programs” with an aim to “improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the executive branch.”\n\nPart of the OMB director’s mandate is to seek out redundant functions in the executive branch, to identify functions better left to the states and to assess the costs and benefits of the services that the federal government delivers.\n\nThere are, of course, two ways to look at this. There is the Trum-skeptic view, which considers the move window dressing on an ideologically-driven plan to drastically reduce the size of the federal government and its influence on the daily life of the nation. To some Trump advisers, like Bannon, a reduction of the size of the government is essentially a good in and of itself.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would ‘Devastate’ Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nThe other, more optimistic view is that this represents a real chance to begin a serious discussion of genuine government reform. That’s how Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, is choosing to look at the Trump plan.\n\n“It’s certainly too early for people to be throwing stones,” he said, by suggesting this is just cover for an effort to slash the size of the federal government. “This doesn’t presuppose any conclusions, at least on the face of the order,” he noted. He also pointed out that the order includes language directing the agency heads to consider the impact of cuts on necessary public services.\n\n“That’s really important and something to be lauded -- it’s recognition that the people are at stake here,” he said.\n\nStier, whose organization is dedicated to finding ways to make government agencies work better, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, said that there is plenty of relatively obvious targets for a reform effort.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\n“We have over $100 billion spent on improper payments. There’s duplication in back office functions. And there’s a huge opportunity for thinking of the government as an integrated enterprise.”\n\nHowever, he warned, government reform efforts have come and gone over the years, and there are some stumbling blocks the Trump administration would do well to avoid.\n\nThe first, he said, is failing to assure real buy-in from members of Congress -- something that caused real problems during the years following the reorganization of the nation’s law enforcement and national security services to create the of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“Congress plays an incredibly important role,” he said. “No organizational changes are going to take effect without Congress signing on.”\n\nRelated: Ryan: We Don’t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nThe second is failing to understand that “as much as organization matters, people matter more and that includes the political leaders. This is a very hard task to take on without having his team in place in the agencies.”\n\nThe Trump administration will have a hard time getting really thorough, smart analyses of the various agencies it controls if it doesn’t have the people it needs in key positions at those agencies -- and Stier, whose organization is tracking the White House’s appointments to key executive branch positions, warns that the administration has already fallen behind previous administrations in naming people to key positions.\n\nThe administration may need to decide which is more important -- sticking to its 180-day timetable for the first phase of the project, or waiting until it has the personnel in place to do the job right.\n\n“It’s not just about selecting these people,” Stier said. “It’s getting them up to speed and getting them to work together. And those three things all take time.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/15/Trump-Finally-Crack-Down-Chinas-Hacks-Theft-and-Lies-US-Expense",
    "text": "The Trump administration is breaking with America’s long history of appeasing China. Long coddled by establishment Foggy Bottom types and by U.S. corporations salivating over China’s burgeoning markets – not to mention an Obama White House desperate for a legacy climate deal -- Beijing has met little resistance as it has cyber attacked U.S. corporate and military secrets, broken trade agreements, ignored international law courts, lied about its intentions in the South China Sea, fudged its climate regulations, worked to undermine American alliances in Asia and harbored the villains running North Korea. No more.\n\nThere’s a new sheriff in town, and the opening salvo came last week when the Commerce Department announced it had imposed record-level civil and criminal penalties of $1.2 billion on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE. The fines were levied in response to ZTE’s illegal exports of equipment to Iran and North Korea – exports that violated sanctions imposed against Tehran. If approved by the courts, it would be would be the largest fine and forfeiture ever levied by the U.S. government in an export control case.\n\nRelated: China Is Ready to Step into America’s Role as World Leader\n\nCommerce’s announcement about the fees further rattled the cage. Secretary Wilbur Ross said, “We are putting the world on notice: the games are over. Those who flout our economic sanctions and export control laws will not go unpunished – they will suffer the harshest of consequences.”\n\nThe five-year investigation into ZTE found that the company had aggressively conspired to conceal evidence of its misdeeds and lied to U.S. officials. After being served with a subpoena in 2012, its shipments to Iran declined but then picked up again when management decided in November 2013 to thwart the U.S. embargo even as the federal probe was ongoing. Ross said ZTE made “283 more shipments to North Korea after the investigation had begun.”\n\nWhy not? Chinese companies and the government had little reason to fear the Obama White House. Several months earlier, President Obama had met at Sunnylands with President Xi Jinping, purportedly to deliver a stern message about cyber hacking and other bad behavior. Just before the summit, The Washington Post had published an explosive report about China hacking more than two dozen major advanced U.S. weapons systems, a breach thought likely to significantly shrink America’s military advantage. Access to the technology could save the Chinese 25-years’ of research and tens of billions of dollars as they race to match U.S. capabilities, experts said.\n\nNaturally, Xi stonewalled the charges of cyber thefts, insisting that China, too, was the victim of hacks, and shared the U.S.’ concerns. Obama, whose position was admittedly weakened by revelations of NSA spying, went along with this nonsense despite a National Intelligence Estimate earlier in the year, which definitively identified China as the country most wantonly penetrating U.S. businesses and institutions.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD? A $1.6 Billion US Weapon That’s Going to Korea – and Worrying China\n\nIncreasing Chinese aggression (cyber and otherwise) has been met by American hand-wringing and dithering over issues such as whether employing the THAAD system (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) in South Korea to counter North Korea’s growing arsenal might offend Beijing. Foreign policy wonks advise appeasement; a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, typical of establishment thinking, advises that “The United States should welcome a more influential China, so long as it respects other countries’ interests, contributes to the common good, and adheres to international laws and norms.”\n\nIt’s not clear what the U.S. should do when Beijing patently does not respect other countries’ interests, and it’s obvious the Obama White House was confused as well. Even as they pursued trade violations and won monetary settlements, they avoided offending China’s leaders by declining to collect the monies owed.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox Business’ Varney & Company, Ross reported that the Obama administration had failed to collect penalties assessed of Chinese companies that broke U.S. trade agreements. Ross reiterated the charge in an interview with Maria Bartiromo asserting, “Billions of dollars of countervailing duties have not been collected.” As he pointed out, given the expense and labor of charging violators, it makes no sense whatsoever not to collect.\n\nEspecially since these are high-stakes situations that have hurt Americans.\n\nFor instance, the White House charged in 2015 that Beijing’s price supports of its domestic corn, rice and wheat exceeded its WTO commitment limit by $100 billion. Our government argued that American farmers were consequently unable to compete and to sell their goods to China.\n\nRelated: The US Navy Sends a Powerful Message to Beijing in the South China Sea\n\nA study sponsored by the U.S. Wheat Associates, a lobbying group, and conducted by Iowa State University, estimated that those Chinese price supports cost U.S. wheat farmers alone between $650 and $700 million annually.\n\nMore recently, at the urging of eight U.S. senators, the Obama White House lodged a complaint with the WTO over China’s subsidies for its aluminum industry – support that critics say includes 27 different subsidy programs, costing thousands of American jobs. Excess capacity among Chinese producers has pushed down costs worldwide and driven numerous U.S. producers out of business. In 2000, there were 23 smelters operating in the U.S.; by the end of last year, there were only five.\n\nNot all of China’s trade cheating is so straight-forward. The Chamber of Commerce issued a report in 2014 charging that Beijing’s enforcement of its 2008 anti-monopoly law was leading to unfair treatment of American companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm, possibly in violation of WTO rules. The report said that China’s antitrust “remedies often appear designed to advance industrial policy and boost national champions [while] intellectual property rights have been curtailed.”\n\nIt is cheering to see the Trump White House cracking down on Chinese misbehavior. Beijing’s policies have targeted job-creation, and now we do the same. As Ross said recently, “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will be aggressively enforcing strong trade policies with the dual purpose of protecting American national security and protecting American workers.” It’s about time."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/14/Why-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-May-Not-Get-Built-After-All",
    "text": "Canada’s oil industry is facing a dilemma – three major proposed pipelines but perhaps only room enough for two of them.\n\nFor years, the oil industry in Canada has been fighting for expanded pipeline capacity. Landlocked Alberta has had trouble getting its oil to market. Every direction except north has been seriously considered, with TransCanada, Enbridge and Kinder Morgan jockeying to advance their competing projects to service Alberta. All of these projects have been bogged down by a combination of the federal approval process, environmental protest and opposition from First Nations.\n\nRelated: Why the Keystone XL Pipeline May Never Happen, Even With Trump's Approval\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline saga is nearly a decade old and there is still no steel in the ground. Over the years, Canadian heavy oil has been forced to sell at a discount because of the shortage of pipeline space. In fact, the lack of pipeline capacity has been singled out as one of the top threats to expanded oil sands production. That is exactly why environmental groups targeted Keystone XL years ago, and it is exactly why the oil industry says building pipelines is its top priority.\n\n“Canada’s energy future relies on our ability to get Canadian oil and gas to the people who need it,” Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said last year. “Connecting Canadian supply to new and growing markets abroad, safely and competitively, is a top priority.” Canadian pipelines can carry 4 million barrels of oil per day, which is just a bit above the actual oil flows in 2015 at 3.981 mb/d, according to CAPP. Without more pipelines, oil sands companies cannot expand their operations. The industry is targeting an additional 850,000 bpd over the next five years.\n\nIn late 2015, the issue looked like it was going nowhere. The Obama administration had just killed off the Keystone XL project, rejecting it on climate grounds. Alternative routes also struggled for acceptance. Moreover, falling oil prices forced oil companies to cancel or delay several dozen oil sands projects.\n\nBut a little more than a year later and Alberta finds itself in a different situation: three viable pipelines from three different companies, all of which are determined to move forward in a market that might only need two of them.\n\nRelated: Trump signs order to move controversial oil pipelines forward\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, the Canadian government gave federal approval to two major pipeline expansions: the Trans Mountain Expansion and the Line 3 replacement. Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion project will see the construction of a twin line that will run parallel to an existing pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast. The expansion will nearly triple its capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 bpd. Enbridge also received approval for the replacement and overhaul of its Line 3 pipeline from Alberta to Wisconsin in the United States. The replacement of the pipeline will nearly double its carrying capacity to 760,000 bpd.\n\nThen there is the Keystone XL Pipeline, which, like a zombie, refuses to die. The election of President Donald Trump brought the project, left for dead by President Obama, back to life. TransCanada hopes to move forward on the project.\n\nBut according to Enbridge, there may not be a market for all three pipelines. \"If you look at the supply profile and you look at our expansion replacement capacity for Line 3 and one other pipeline, that should suffice based on the current supply outlook, out to at least mid-next decade,\" Enbridge’s CEO Al Monaco said on a fourth quarter earnings call. Naturally, Monaco wants his company’s Line 3 to be one of the two pipelines to move forward.\n\nThe obvious odd man out would be Keystone XL despite the support from the Trump administration. CAPP expects additional Canadian oil output on the order of 850,000 bpd 2021; the IEA largely agrees, projecting a 900,000 bpd increase by 2022. That lines up nicely with the capacity additions from the Trans Mountain expansion (+590,000 bpd) and the Line 3 expansion (roughly +370,000), which would add just under 1 mb/d in new pipeline capacity. Keystone XL, a nearly 1,200-mile pipeline, would add 830,000 in new capacity.\n\nMore importantly, the Trans Mountain and Line 3 expansions would be adding new pipes on existing routes, not bulldozing new territory. They would not have the massive seizure of public and private land problems that Keystone XL still has to go through. The two expansions would literally just be installing new pipeline where existing and older pipeline is currently located. Similarly, those projects face fewer legal hurdles than Keystone XL, which still has to overcome local lawsuits.\n\nThus, the comments from Enbridge’s CEO, warning that not all three pipelines will get built, is worth noting. Wood Mackenzie agrees. \"We definitely need two of these pipelines by around 2025 and after that it depends on the supply outlook,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter said, according to Reuters. \"There's not an evident need to get three or four pipelines built.\"\n\nSo, Keystone XL might be back from the dead, but it is unclear for how long.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

    "text": "In a show of massive military might in and around the Korean peninsula, the Trump administration is sending a powerful warning to the erratic – and some would say lunatic – regime of Kim Jong-un in North Korea: Back off.\n\nEven as the Republic of South Korea leadership remains roiled after the ouster of President Park Geun-hye in a corruption scandal that has rocked the country, the U.S. military and ROK army and navy are not just continuing with war games begun on March 1, but they are openly confrontational.\n\nRelated: North Korea’s Missile Test Leaves Trump with Three Options\n\nThe nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson began plying the waters off South Korea Tuesday, according to a report by two Reuters reporters on board. To sharpen the point, F-18 Super Hornets are roaring off the flight deck.\n\nAmong the joint forces taking part in the exercise involving 300,000 ROK and almost 20,000 U.S. troops are Navy SEALs, Army Rangers and members of Delta Force. Fox News is saying Tuesday that the Pentagon is denying multiple reports on Monday – based on a story from Yonhap News Agency -- that members of SEAL Team 6, which killed Osama Bin Laden, would also be involved and would be engaged in training aimed at “decapitating” North Korea’s leadership.\n\nLast week, in an apparent response to the war games, North Korea fired four antiballistic missiles that landed in the Sea of Japan, some as close as 190 miles from the coast. The BBC says that’s the third time it has tested missiles since last August.\n\nBut the answer back to Pyongyang goes beyond continuing with the joint exercises.\n\nThe U.S. is positioning at least two THAAD anti-missile systems in South Korea, a move that led Beijing, which worries about the ability of the system’s radar to penetrate past North Korea and deep into China, to propose a moratorium on North Korea’s missile program in exchange for a termination of the war games. That proposal was rejected by Washington.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD? A $1.6 Billion US Weapon That’s Going to Korea – and Worrying China\n\nIn addition, the U.S. is permanently placing a Gray Eagle attack-drone unit at Kunsan Air Base on the west coast of South Korea, Stars and Stripes reports. The Gray Eagle is an upgrade of the Predator and is used for surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting. It can stay airborne for up to 25 hours, the website of its maker, General Atomics, says and can carry as many as four Hellfire air-to-surface missiles.\n\nStars and Stripes quoted an unnamed South Korean military official as saying, “In case of a war on the Korean Peninsula, the unmanned aircraft could infiltrate the skies of North Korea and make a precision strike on the war command and other major military facilities.”\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is set to visit Seoul and meet with the acting president, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn. And in early April, China President Xi Jinping is scheduled to confer with Donald Trump at a two-day summit at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. North Korea is certain to be on the agenda of both meetings, but since China is Pyongyang’s main sponsor, the Xi visit is likely to be the most unnerving to the unpredictable Kim Jong-un.\n\nRelated: Is Rex Tillerson Already Irrelevant – or Playing a Long Game?\n\nMeantime, in what the South China Morning Post calls Japan’s “biggest show of naval force” since World War II, its helicopter carrier Izumo will cruise through the disputed waters of the South China Sea starting in May and will conduct joint maneuvers with U.S. and Indian naval forces in the Indian Ocean in July.\n\nJapan is also buying new F-35s, which may eventually fly off the two-year-old Izumo.\n\nSouth Korean elections to replace disgraced President Park will also be held in May, and the favorite candidate is a liberal, Moon Jae-in, who was defeated by Park in 2012. Moon is said to be more open to reducing tensions with North Korea. But on Tuesday he cautioned China about the economic pressure it is imposing on South Korea, which some see as retaliation for deploying the THAAD anti-missile systems.\n\nCorrection: The story has been corrected. An earlier version stated that the USS Carl Vinson is equipped with F-35 aircraft, but the F-35 is not scheduled for deployment on U.S. aircraft carriers for several more years."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/14/Now-It-s-Democrats-Turn-Threaten-Government-Shutdown",
    "text": "When President Trump unveils his fiscal 2018 budget plan this week, he will be kicking off an explosive debate on Capitol Hill that could lead to another government shutdown.\n\nThe new Republican administration plans to shrink scores of domestic agencies and programs as well as the State Department and the Internal Revenue Service to offset the cost of a $54 billion boost in defense spending. And Trump needs tens of billions more to fund a massive buildup of immigration and border patrol forces and to begin construction of a 2,000-mile-long wall along the southern border that could cost $25 billion.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nUntil recently, Democrats have had relatively little critical to say about Trump’s spending priorities. A few – including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) -- even suggested the Democrats might find common ground with the new president on a handful of proposals, such as $1 trillion for infrastructure spending or a paid family leave program.\n\nBut it now appears that the Democrats have concluded that their best comeback strategy is to oppose Trump and GOP leaders at every turn -- just as the Republicans regained control of the White House and both chambers of Congress by opposing former President Obama on virtually every major issue, from health care and infrastructure to the environment and a nuclear non-proliferation deal with Iran.\n\nOn Monday, Schumer and four other leading Democrats put Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on notice they were prepared to precipitate a government shutdown if Trump and the Republicans insist on including the first down payment on construction of the border wall in a $1 trillion package of spending bills needed to keep the government operating for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nThe Schumer letter also warned against adding other “poison pills” to the spending bills, such as defunding Planned Parenthood or rolling back environmental or consumer protections. And it argued that additional funds should be added for domestic programs to match any additional military spending demanded by Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\n“We believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s administration,” the letter stated.\n\nWhile Trump’s overall fiscal 2018 budget proposals will be subject to a lengthy review and action over the coming months, Congress is facing a looming April 28 deadline to complete authorization of funding for the remainder of the current fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30.\n\nMcConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) decided late last year to postpone final action on this year’s spending to give Trump an opportunity to weigh in on budget priorities, especially this year’s defense spending levels. Trump – who has vowed to increase military funding sharply -- is pressing Congress to lift the legal caps on discretionary defense spending this year and next.\n\nThe Republicans are using special budget “reconciliation” rules to try to ram through the Obamacare repeal and replacement legislation in the coming weeks with a simple majority, without any assistance from the Democrats. However, they will definitely need at least some Democratic votes in the Senate to achieve the 60-vote super-majority necessary to complete work on this year’s appropriations bills and avert a government shutdown.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nThe Republicans hold a 52 to 48 vote majority in the Senate. Even if McConnell can hold together all the GOP votes, he would still need the support of at least eight Democrats to achieve cloture and move to final passage of the massive spending bills.\n\nThe last government shutdown in October 2013 lasted for 16 days and forced the furloughing of more than 800,000 federal workers. That shutdown was triggered by a bruising battle between the Obama administration and conservative Republicans in the House and Senate who were attempting to cut funding for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe funding disputes this year will be every bit as difficult to resolve, with neither party inclined to engage in the type of political give and take necessary to avoid a crisis.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are gambling that they can achieve their most important goals – including the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, overhauling the Medicaid program and passing major tax cuts -- without inviting Democrats to the negotiating table.\n\nBut with their own party badly fractured over an Obamacare replacement and sharp divisions over tax policy and trade, Trump eventually will have no choice but to seek Democratic support to achieve the semblance of a successful legislative program.\n\nRelated: The Debt Ceiling: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?\n\nWhat’s more, the Trump administration and GOP leaders have yet to reveal their strategy for averting a debt ceiling crisis this fall. It’s far from clear whether Democrats will agree to cooperate or find ways to put up obstacles to increasing the Treasury’s borrowing authority.\n\nWith the national debt fast approaching an historic $20 trillion, the Treasury this week technically bumped up against its borrowing authority and has begun taking “extraordinary measures” to buy some extra time before it must default on its loans.\n\nBy early September, Trump and Congress will be under mounting pressure to enact legislation to increase the Treasury’s borrowing authority to protect the government’s AAA credit rating. Because many conservative Republicans will be unwilling to vote for a higher debt ceiling, Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California should have some added leverage over the Republicans in negotiating a budget or tax deal."

Some of the world’s richest people have not fared quite as well.\n\nFour of the 20 richest billionaires have seen their net worth decline since Donald Trump’s unexpected presidential win, led by Mexican mogul Carlos Slim, according to an analysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Slim’s fortune has dwindled by more than $3 billion, or 6 percent of the $54.9 billion net worth he had on Election Day. Slim has also slipped one notch on the list of the world’s richest people, dropping from fifth to sixth.\n\nThe other billionaire losers, according to the Bloomberg index, include Charles and David Koch, Republican mega-donors who refused to endorse Trump during the campaign. The elder of the two, Charles, famously said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Trump was like choosing between cancer and a heart attack. The brothers also publicly condemned Trump’s first travel ban in January.\n\nEach of the brothers had $48 billion to their name as of March 14, down 5 percent since Nov. 8, when their fortunes measured $50.5 billion apiece.\n\nAmancio Ortega — the Spanish owner of Zara stores — has seen his fortune shrink by 5.5 percent to $68.7 billion from $72.7 billion, enough to knock him from the No. 2 spot down to No. 4.\n\nRelated: The Billionaire's Daughter Quietly Shaping the Trump Campaign\n\nThe biggest gainer since the election is Warren Buffett, who was an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter and fundraiser. His fortune grew by 18.3 percent, from $66.5 billion to $78.7 billion. He moved up two spots in Bloomberg’s ranking to No. 2 on the list. Last summer, Buffett famously challenged Trump to release his tax returns and denounced Trump’s criticisms of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of an Army captain killed in Iraq. But after the election, Buffett tempered his stance on Trump and said in an interview that the newly elected president won’t wreck the economy or stock market.\n\nRank Election day rank Billionaire Election Day net worth (in billions) Net worth as of 3/8/17 (in billions) % change 1 1 Bill Gates $78.9 $85.7 8.6% 2 4 Warren Buffett $66.5 $78.7 18.3% 3 3 Jeff Bezos $68.6 $73.9 7.7% 4 2 Amancio Ortega $72.7 $70.6 -2.9% 5 6 Mark Zuckerberg $54.3 $60.1 10.7% 6 5 Carlos Slim $54.9 $51.6 -6.0% 7 7 Charles Koch $50.5 $48.0 -5.0% 7 7 David Koch $50.5 $48.0 -5.0% 9 9 Larry Ellison $42.0 $45.2 7.6% 10 10 Larry Page $41.0 $43.4 5.9% 11 11 Ingvar Kamprad $41.0 $43.1 5.1% 12 12 Sergey Brin $40.2 $42.4 5.5% 13 13 Bernard Arnault $36.9 $41.6 12.7% 14 14 Liliane Bettencourt $36.5 $37.2 1.9% 15 15 Jack Ma $35.1 $36.1 2.8% 16 16 Rob Walton $34.5 $35.0 1.4% 17 17 Jim Walton $34.3 $34.7 1.2% 18 18 Alice Walton $33.5 $33.6 0.3% 19 19 John Mars $31.9 $32.7 2.5% 20 20 Jacqueline Mars $31.9 $32.7 2.5%\n\nSource: Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n\nThe other biggest winners include Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, who in January met Trump and told him he was considering expanding two U.S. factories. Arnault’s net worth has increased 12.7 percent to more than $41 billion.\n\nRelated: The Phantom Billionaire Who’s Richer Than Warren Buffett\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos round out the top five net worth increases since the presidential election. Bezos and Trump have had a contentious relationship, especially during the campaign. Trump at one point said that Amazon would “have problems” if he became president. And Bezos came out publicly in opposition to the president’s travel ban. Yet Amazon shares have gained more than 8 percent since the election, helping Bezos gain more than $5 billion in wealth.\n\nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index is updated each business day after trading closes in New York."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/14/How-Health-Care-Crippling-Speaker-House",
    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is looking lonelier and lonelier as Republicans in the House and Senate – and even President Trump -- continue to distance themselves from the proposed American Health Care Act, House leadership’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Already facing opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, the report from the Congressional Budget Office issued on Monday only increased divisions in a party that will need almost perfect unity to succeed in passing the legislation.\n\nThe CBO’s report found that the bill could cost up to 24 million Americans their health insurance by 2026, a problem that has even lawmakers normally loyal to the Republican leadership in the House shaking their heads.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Health Plan Would ‘Devastate’ Mentally Ill, Addicted\n\nVirginia Congressman Rob Wittman wrote on his Facebook page Monday night, “I do believe that we can enact meaningful health care reforms that put the patient and health care provider back at the center of our healthcare system, but this bill is not the right answer.”\n\nOn the Senate side, where passage of the bill as written is even more in doubt than it is in the House, Republican moderates were plainly alarmed at the coverage numbers.\n\n“The top line numbers are alarming,” Maine Sen. Susan Collins told reporters on Monday night. “These kinds of estimates are going to cause revisions in the bill, almost certainly. I don’t think that the bill that is being considered now is the bill that ultimately will be the one that we vote on in the Senate.”\n\nEven Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Majority Whip, conceded that eliminating coverage for 24 million people might be a bridge too far. “Obviously, we want to improve those coverage numbers,” he told reporters on Monday.\n\nRelated: GOP Replacement Plan Could Send Hospital Costs Soaring Again\n\nBut the biggest problem facing Ryan may be that all indications are that the person with the largest megaphone in the discussion, President Trump, appears to be moving in a direction that would worsen, not improve, coverage rates.\n\nTrump has been leaning toward changes to the bill that House conservatives, like Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows of North Carolina want to see, according to Politico. Meadows and others in his caucus have expressed strong reservations about the AHCA, complaining that it leaves too much of the ACA intact and that its introduction of refundable tax credits for purchasing insurance on the open market amount to the creation of a new entitlement program.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan, an influential voice within the Freedom Caucus, appeared on Fox News Tuesday morning and blasted the plan. “This bill doesn’t repeal Obamacare,” he said. “This bill doesn’t unite Republicans. This bill doesn’t bring down the cost of premiums.”\n\nHe added, “There’s a reason every major conservative organization in the country is opposed to this legislation.”\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan -- Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nLawmakers like Meadows and Jordan are vitally important to the bill’s passage because the Freedom Caucus, by itself, has enough votes to derail the legislation in the House of Representatives, even if everyone else in the Republican conference remains united.\n\nTo appease conservatives, Politico reports, Trump and his senior advisers have been indicating that they are open to changes to the legislation, such as speeding up the phase-out of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and accelerating other changes to the healthcare market.\n\nOf course, those changes won’t just do zero to address the number of people who lose their insurance under AHCA. It will only make sure that they lose it even faster.\n\nThe White House seems to be banking on the idea that by appeasing conservatives, the bill will be able to get through the House, even if it loses a small number of supporters among Republicans concerned about the coverage losses.\n\nRelated: GOP’s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nBut Paul Ryan’s biggest problem is greater than just getting the bill through the House. He needs a bill that can also pass the Senate.\n\nNormally, it’s not the job of the House Speaker to worry about votes in the other chamber. But Ryan will be asking his members to vote on a proposal that will be featured in every Democratic House candidate’s campaign advertisements in 2018, and he can’t ask them to do that without offering a reasonable path by which the measure becomes law.\n\nRight now, he doesn’t have one, and unfortunately for the House Speaker, every concession he makes to conservatives makes it less likely he will find one. In the Senate, Republicans can only afford to lose three votes without killing the legislation, and even that would require a tie-breaking vote by the vice president.\n\nChanges to the bill that further depress the percentage of Americans with insurance coverage, or accelerate the loss of coverage are only going to harden the opposition it faces from Senate Republicans like Maine’s Collins and others who have expressed concern about the proposal’s effects on the uninsured rate.\n\nIt’s a dilemma that offers the Speaker no obvious way out, and help from the White House doesn’t seem to be forthcoming."

    "text": "By now, the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment of the proposed American Health Care Act’s impact on health coverage in the US is well-known. The Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is projected to leave 14 million fewer Americans with health insurance after its first year, a number that rises to 24 million after 10 years.\n\nMuch of that reduction in coverage would come because of poor seniors being priced out of the market by extraordinary increases in the cost of coverage. According to CBO, a 64-year-old with earnings equal to 175 percent of the federal poverty line would see their net annual premium costs after tax credits rise from $1,700 per year to $14,600 per year, a 759 percent increase.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nLess well understood, though, is the impact the law would have on some of the country’s most vulnerable individuals: Medicaid recipients with mental illness, addiction problems, and even dementia.\n\nDespite Republicans’ near constant claim that Obamacare recipients have coverage but no ability to access care because of high deductibles, the Affordable Care Act made not just coverage, but actual care, available to millions of people through the expansion of the Medicaid program. Among other things, the law mandated that state Medicaid programs, in exchange for a massive inflow of federal funds, cover mental health and addiction services.\n\nUnder the AHCA, that requirement would go away, and according to experts like Kenneth Davis, a doctor who also serves as CEO of New York City’s Mount Sinai Hospital, even people in states that continue to cover those services will face new hurdles to getting and maintaining coverage.\n\n“Twenty percent of people on Medicaid have psychiatric illness, addiction, or dementia,” Davis said in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Monday night. “Those people are going to be asked, every six months, to prove their eligibility again.”\n\nRelated: GOP’s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nUnder current law, he said, they are only required to demonstrate eligibility annually. While the change may seem relatively minor to most people, Davis said, it would have a profound impact on people with diminished or impaired mental capacity.\n\n“What happens inevitably to those people is that they fall through the cracks,” he said. “They can’t get it together to get all the paperwork together.”\n\nThe effect will be an increased number of people who drop out of the system, many of whom will wind up in hospital emergency rooms when they face a health crisis.\n\n“Another thing that happens along the way is when those people are signed up again, they are retroactive for only 30 days. And what they are usually signed up by is the hospital because of the catastrophic condition that caused the to be admitted, which is often more than a 30-day stay. And in fact, the previous law gave a 90-day retroactive. So what you are going to have is a lot of people who are going to fall off the rolls of Medicaid.”\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don’t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nHe said that the plan would have a “fairly devastating effect” on hospitals and in the end, would reduce the availability of services even to people with insurance coverage.\n\n\"You're going to see a lot of the hospitals that take care of indigent populations, large Medicaid populations, have to close,” he said. “You're going to see diminished services. You're going to see hospitals like ours, which are academic medical centers, find ways to cut other parts of our programs substantially.\""

    "text": "The U.S. hospital industry is irate about provisions in the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that would freeze spending on expanded Medicaid coverage for 10 million people in 31 states in 2020 followed by sharply reduce federal assistance to Medicaid.\n\nJoining forces with physicians, nurses, some insurers and advocates for the elderly and poor, top executives of the American Hospital Association complained last week that GOP efforts to transform Medicaid from an entitlement program to a fixed per capita allocation system would shortchange vulnerable people while continuing to reimburse providers below the actual cost of their services.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan: Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\n\n\nThose concerns were more than confirmed on Monday with the release of the much-anticipated Congressional Budget Office analysis of the GOP’s American Health Care Act: There would be 24 million fewer Americans with health care coverage than there would be under the current Obamacare law between 2018 and 2026, and the bulk of those losses – fully two-thirds -- would be among Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nCBO estimates that several major provisions of the GOP plan adversely affecting Medicaid would decrease spending on the program by $880 billion over the coming decade. That reduction would be due mainly to lower enrollments throughout the period, culminating in 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026.\n\nRelated: GOP’s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nSome of that decline would be among people who are currently eligible for Medicaid benefits while others would be people who subsequently were made eligible by states that decide to accept the expanded Medicaid coverage before the ax starts to fall on the program.\n\n“Some decline in spending and enrollment would begin immediately, but most of the changes would begin in 2020, when the legislation would terminate the enhanced federal matching rate for new enrollees under the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid and would place a per capita-based cap on the federal government’s payments to states for medical assistance provided through Medicaid,” CBO reported.\n\nFederal spending on Medicaid has increased more than on Medicare over the past few years—to an average rate of 7.5 percent annually. That means Medicaid costs this year would be about $638 billion. But by 2026, Medicaid spending would be about 25 percent less than what CBO projects under current law.\n\nAs spending on Medicaid plummets, hospitals and other medical providers will incur steep losses to provide emergency treatment and services to those least able to pay for them.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don’t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nUnder Obamacare, states that chose to participate in Medicaid expansion, which opened the program to single, able-bodied adults, broadened their programs to cover people making up to 138 percent of poverty-level income. States could decide whether to participate in accordance with a landmark June 2012 Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIf the Republican replacement plan is ultimately enacted, the states would continue to receive expanded Medicaid benefits until 2020. After that, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost of existing eligible beneficiaries while new beneficiaries would be funded at a much lower level. Eventually, the expanded program would be phased out.\n\nPrior to the ACA, hospitals throughout the country struggled to cover the cost of charitable treatment of low-income patients, bad debts or inadequate reimbursement from Medicaid because of regional disparities in health care costs. Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers amounted to 90 percent of the costs of patient care in 2013, according to estimates by the American Hospital Association.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nMany studies – including one by researchers at Northwestern University -- have shown that reductions in uncompensated care costs almost exclusively occurred in states that expanded Medicaid, according to the Healthcare Financial Management Association.\n\n“The uninsured has gone from 18 percent to 11 percent of the population. It's been very beneficial, particularly to my [hospital] members who are in lower-income neighborhoods and lower-income parts of this country and rural hospitals, too,” Thomas Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, told National Public Radio on Monday. “So it will be a burden on the hospitals to have to have additional uncompensated care.”\n\nUnfunded care in Medicaid expansion states fell from 4.1 percentage points of operating costs to 3.2 percentage points, said a report by the Healthcare Financial Management Association last August. “In non-expansion states, uncompensated care costs continued close to their existing trend, remaining at about 5.7 percentage points of hospitals’ operating costs,” the report stated.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThe Healthcare Financial Management Association, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Department of Health and Human Services, and Kaiser Family Foundation all found dramatic reductions in unfunded care resulting from both the ACA’s cost-saving mandates and Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe reports generally defined uncompensated care costs as the sum of losses on charity care and bad debt. Nickels warned that hospitals throughout the country would suffer a serious financial setback if the Republican Congress succeeds in rolling back expanded Medicaid.\n\n“We would definitely want to continue that Medicaid expansion into the future.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/14/Why-So-Many-CEOs-Are-Cozying-Trump",
    "text": "I’ve managed to find what I believe is the only explicit show of support for the American Health Care Act outside of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office. Joseph Swedish, the CEO of health insurance giant Anthem, threw his support behind the bid to repeal and replace Obamacare in a letter to Congress, saying it “addresses the challenges immediately facing the individual market and will ensure more affordable health plan choices for consumers in the short term.”\n\nAs the Republican plan promises generally stingier support for health insurance, with higher premium costs, co-pays and deductibles on the individual market, I don’t understand Swedish’s claim. Even in the short term, the proposal eliminates the individual mandate penalty, enabling healthy consumers to avoid getting insured unless they get sick. That could worsen the current problem for insurers: a sicker covered population than expected. Indeed, even America’s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobbying group for big insurers like Anthem, expressed concern over numerous pieces of the GOP bill, including the inadequate tax credits to purchase insurance and the vanishing mandate penalty.\n\nRelated: Why the Republican Health Care Plan Is Destined to Fail\n\nSo why does Anthem see success in repeal and replace where so many see failure? Why is the CEO more excited about this plan than many Republicans are? It may have something to do with the fact that Anthem wants to buy fellow giant Cigna for $54 billion. And in the Trump era, Anthem, like many other corporations seeking mergers and acquisitions, has decided that the path to success in building monopoly power goes directly through the White House.\n\nThat’s a very disturbing prospect, because merger reviews operate out of nominally independent federal agencies, at both the Federal Trade Commission and (in the case of the insurance industry) the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. Yet corporate wooing of Trump to grease the wheels for merger approval creates a serious conflict of interest hanging over one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. economy.\n\nA federal judge blocked the Anthem/Cigna merger in February; Anthem decided to appeal (Cigna is grudgingly going along with the challenge). In its arguments ahead of the March 24 appeal, Anthem said in open court that it believed the Trump administration would be more favorable to the merger than Justice Department officials under President Obama. And just a couple weeks after that comment, Anthem’s CEO stakes out a lonely position in favor of what to this point is Trump’s signature legislative initiative.\n\nRelated: Republican Health Plan — Good for the Budget, Bad for the Poor and Elderly\n\nIf anything, Anthem’s strategy is less overt than those of its corporate counterparts. CEOs of companies awaiting completion of merger reviews have formally met with Trump. AT&T chief Randall Stephenson sat down with the president-elect in January; the two sides claimed the telecom’s pending $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner didn’t come up. Even if true, ex parte communications between the president and CEOs awaiting merger approval are highly unusual.\n\nThe heads of Bayer and Monsanto, meanwhile, did discuss their $66 billion proposed merger with Trump at a January meeting. In fact, Trump appeared to dictate terms, announcing a pledge that the new company would spend $8 billion on research and development and add jobs. This completely disregards due process, sells out family farmers and weakens competition in the seed and pesticide markets, in exchange for vows that were apparently already made well before the Trump meeting, and a vague reference to jobs, when the merger itself is designed to create corporate “synergies” that will downsize workers, as is typical for corporate consolidations.\n\nTrump also met with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, securing another dubious pledge of $50 billion in U.S. investment. But the meeting appeared to give SoftBank the greenlight to pursue a merger between its subsidiary Sprint and T-Mobile, which SoftBank has considered previously. Talks between SoftBank and Trump’s team have continued since that initial meeting in December. Last week, reports indicated that Son was “betting big on Trump,” and that Sprint could join with either T-Mobile or Comcast.\n\nRelated: OMB Director Mulvaney Blowing Smoke on Health Law’s Impact\n\nIt was strong antitrust enforcement from the Obama administration that blocked T-Mobile from a series of proposed mergers, leading to competition that has proved beneficial for consumers. We wouldn’t see every major wireless carrier offer unlimited data plans without T-Mobile making the first foray.\n\nBut Trump hasn’t filled any of the vacancies in antitrust positions at the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, much like the other open posts across the federal government. This centralizes power inside the White House in unusual and disturbing ways. We have a legal process for determining whether markets have grown unfairly concentrated, based on enforcing century-old laws that promote competition. That doesn’t include sucking up to the president and hoping that influences whatever monopolization corporations want.\n\nThe Justice Department has of course maintained that it won’t be swayed by political considerations in merger review. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions was one of Trump’s closest confidants on the campaign trail, and his independence has already been questioned. Moreover, if Trump is cutting deals with the likes of Bayer and SoftBank, the Justice Department will be under enormous pressure to not inhibit them by blocking those plans.\n\nRelated: GOP’s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nThe end result here is a de facto private government, with corporations able to appeal to one man who thinks running the country equals having CEOs visit the White House every other day to chat. Communications channels to Trump come overwhelmingly from a small subset of the country, one that has its own agenda in mind: more consolidation, more accumulation of power and more use of that power to maximize and hoard profits while destroying competitors. We know that concentrated markets, which have worsened over the past three decades, equal higher consumer prices, fragile supply chains, greater inequality and a kind of sickness in the economy — a lack of dynamism that harms all of us. While it’s bad for the country, it’s good for those at the top. And they have a straight channel to the president to get things done.\n\nThe Republican health care proposal is so battered that Anthem might not get its wish of a reworked insurance market. But it will have shown a president who values loyalty highly that it was willing to give support when few others would. And that could mean getting its prized merger. These days, success in business merely means pleasing a small man who lives on Pennsylvania Avenue."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/13/Republican-Health-Plan-Good-Budget-Bad-Poor-and-Elderly",
    "text": "The much-anticipated Congressional Budget Office analysis of the American Health Care Act, House Republicans’ plan to do away with the Affordable Care Act, was released Monday afternoon, and the findings were a mixed bag for the GOP. On the positive side of the ledger, the plan would save the government $337 billion over the 10-year budget window, and would not send the healthcare marketplace into a death spiral of escalating premiums.\n\nOn the downside, by the end of the 10-year window, there would be 24 million fewer Americans with health care than there would be under the current law, and many of those between 50 and 64 would be paying much, much more for it.\n\nRelated: GOP’s Repeal of Obamacare Taxes Could Put Medicare Closer to Insolvency\n\nThe CBO estimate, chock full of caveats about the difficulty of projecting the results of a complete overhaul of the health insurance system in the US, seems to settle at least one major question about the law: whether it would survive the arcane rules that govern the passage of budget reconciliation bills in the Senate. Had there been evidence that it would significantly increase the federal deficit, the bill would have been dead on arrival.\n\nConcern about the impact of the proposal on the stability of health insurance markets should also be reduced by the report, at least somewhat. There had been concern that by sharply cutting the subsidies available to Americans for the purchase of insurance plans on the nongroup exchanges established by the ACA the law would create a severe imbalance between relatively healthy policyholders and sicker ones.\n\nHowever, the CBO found that a combination of tax credits and penalties for not maintaining continuous coverage would entice enough healthy consumers to purchase insurance to keep the markets stable. Also helping would be premiums kept lower by federal grants from a Patient and State Stability Fund.\n\n“Even though the new tax credits would be structured differently from the current subsidies and would generally be less generous for those receiving subsidies under current law, the other changes would, in the agencies’ view, lower average premiums enough to attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market,” the report found.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don’t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nHowever, it won’t do much to settle the many other battles raging around the legislation, particularly its effect on the number of people in the country with health insurance. By 2026, under current law, the CBO projects that the number of Americans without health insurance would be 28 million. Under the ACHA, by contrast, that number would spike to 52 million.\n\nIn the first year of the ACHA, the report finds, 14 million additional Americans would be without health insurance, but the majority of those would be people who chose not to purchase a policy, running the risk of paying a penalty if they fall ill and have to sign up for a policy. However, in the out years, this changes, and the majority of people without insurance will be those who would have been eligible for it under the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, which the proposed law would eliminate.\n\nThe bill’s effect on the budget, cutting $323 billion from the deficit over 10 years, reflects the net impact of drastic cuts in both spending and revenue. Under the bill, the federal government would reduce outlays by $1.2 trillion dollars, according to the CBO estimate. The of that savings would come from slashing federal Medicaid funding and from replacing the subsidies offered by the ACA with much less generous tax credits under the ACHA.\n\nThe spending cuts are offset by some $900 billion in tax cuts, much of which will go to the wealthiest Americans and to corporations. Among the taxes eliminated are an additional payroll tax for the country’s highest earners, a surtax on wealthy investors’ net investment income, and fees on health insurance companies.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nRepublican promises that the bill would bring down health insurance premiums are supported by the CBO, but with some important caveats. Out of the gate, the bill would actually drive premiums in the nongroup market up by 15 to 20 percent. After three years, though, they would begin to decline, with average levels coming in below current estimate of costs under the ACA.\n\nBut it’s important to note that the CBO is talking about average premiums. The cost decreases would not be evenly distributed but would favor the young at the cost of the elderly.\n\n“Under the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for older enrollees than younger ones rather than three times more as under current law, substantially reducing premiums for young adults and substantially raising premiums for older people.”\n\nPartisan reaction to the CBO score on Capitol Hill broke down along predictable lines.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\n“This report confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums and improve access to quality, affordable care,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. “CBO also finds that this legislation will provide massive tax relief, dramatically reduce the deficit, and make the most fundamental entitlement reform in more than a generation.”\n\nHe added a reminder that the GOP sees the ACHA as only the first step in broader health care reform. “It’s important to note that this report does not take into consideration additional steps Congress and the Trump administration are taking that will further lower costs and increase choices.”\n\nKentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, took a different tack. “Today’s analysis from the CBO confirms that the Republicans’ repeal bill isn’t a health care bill at all. It’s an ideological document with real and incredibly damaging consequences for American families. In order to give another $600 billion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us, Republicans are pursuing a path that will leave 14 million Americans without insurance next year, and result in 24 million more people without coverage by 2026.”"

    "text": "The House GOP drive to wipe out hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increases as part of the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act has rekindled a debate over the long-term solvency of Medicare and the Republicans’ intentions to overhaul the premier federal health insurance program for seniors eventually.\n\nBy repealing a 0.9 percent federal payroll surtax for families earning more than $250,000 a year and individuals making more than $200,000, the Republicans would eliminate an estimated $117 billion in revenue over the coming decade for the Medicare trust fund. That would accelerate by nearly four years the timetable for depleting the Medicare hospitalization trust fund would begin to run out of money, potentially curtailing benefit payments unless additional taxes were raised.\n\nRelated: Ryan--We Don’t Know How Many We Will Cover or How Much It Will Cost\n\nThe 2010 Obamacare law effectively extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by more than 11 years through 2028 by increasing the federal payroll tax on wealthier Americans and by reducing reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other GOP leaders have targeted the payroll tax increase along with $600 billion of other Obamacare-related tax increases on the health care industry and wealthier Americans to make good on their campaign pledge to eviscerate virtually all the tax increases and mandates imposed by the law.\n\n“We made a promise to the people who elected us we would repeal and replace this law,” Ryan said Sunday on the CBS’s Face the Nation. “And we basically said, this is what we would replace it with. And now we are keeping our word.”\n\nCritics including Democratic lawmakers, senior advocacy groups like AARP, which also sell health insurance, and former Department of Health and Human Services official Andy Slavitt charge that repealing the payroll tax hike will speed up the insolvency deadline and violate President Trump’s campaign pledge to do nothing to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits.\n\nRelated: Is This Why the GOP Is Having Trouble Selling Its Health Care Plan?\n\n“This bill breaks a clear Trump promise not to harm Medicare,” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement last week. “In addition to the bill’s many other harmful provisions, it gives a tax break to the wealthy and steals directly from Medicare’s coffers.”\n\nCiting reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security and Medicare trustees, Joyce Rogers, senior vice president for governmental affairs at AARP voiced concern that the Republican replacement plan could “hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to four years and diminish Medicare’s ability to pay for services in the future.”\n\nTrump repeatedly promised during the presidential campaign that he would not cut Social Security or Medicare to control government spending and address long-term deficit problems.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nPrivatization of Medicare for younger Americans has long been a central feature of Ryan's persistent calls for entitlement reform that have enjoyed substantial GOP support in the House but never made it past the Senate. Since Trump and the Republicans swept to victory in November, Ryan and other Republican House leaders have said they believe that the election results are a mandate to push a bold agenda including Medicare reform.\n\nDespite Trump’s campaign promise to take Medicare cuts off the table, Ryan told reporters in late February that the issue was still “an open question.” He said that while he and Trump agreed that Medicare coverage for those who are retired or nearing retirement should be preserved, nothing should preclude taking steps to address the program’s long-term costs and impact on the public debt.\n\n“I’ve been a big-time entitlement reformer for a long time because if you don’t start bending the cost curve in the out years, we are hosed,” Ryan told reporters.\n\nTampering with Medicare for more than 55 million Americans is politically risky at best, and Trump and House Republicans already are hip-deep in controversy over repealing Obamacare, despite the possibility that as many as 15 million people could lose health care coverage over the coming decade.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nMedicare covers much of the cost of hospital care, physician visits and drugs for those 65 and older. Medicare benefit payments totaled $632 billion in 2015 and accounted for 15 percent of the federal budget. It is funded primarily by general revenues, payroll taxes and beneficiary premiums.\n\nWhile providing hospital and physician care to seniors, Medicare has also been troubled for years by fraud and waste. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) once again included Medicare on its “High-Risk List” of agencies and programs vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse. CBO has projected that annual Medicare spending will reach $1.3 trillion by 2026.\n\nSlavitt, who was the acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the last two years of the Obama administration, says he is concerned that Ryan and others are attempting to manufacture a crisis within the Medicare trust fund by repealing the tax, and then using that as an excuse to rush to overhaul the program.\n\n“I think it’s a smarter play for them to move Medicare closer to a crisis, try to get this bill done, and then build a case about why this crisis needs to be addressed,” Slavitt told TalkingPointsMemo late last week.\n\nRyan’s office declined to reply to the criticism directly."

    "text": "It’s been widely documented that during the 2016 election campaign, supporters of overt nationalism that frequently bled into white nationalism seemed to feel more and more free to express their ideas loudly and proudly. The Republican candidate’s decision to bring on Steve Bannon, the head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chair seemed to cement the connection between the new leadership of the Republican Party and the “Alt-right.”\n\nBut even then, US public officials sympathetic to the idea that the US would be better off if it were whiter and more Christian than it is today were at least somewhat circumspect about saying so out loud.\n\nRelated: How the New Trump Travel Ban Could Hurt the US Economy\n\nHowever, with Trump in the Oval Office and Bannon set up as his Chief Strategist with an office in the West Wing, norms about what it’s acceptable to say about people of different races and creeds have been rapidly shattering.\n\nProvocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, now former technology editor at Breitbart, was invited to speak at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, despite a long history of racially charged comments and gleeful sexism. (He was disinvited at the last minute when comments he made that seemed to condone pederasty went public, proving that at least some norms remain in place.)\n\nTrump himself has, now twice, signed executive orders banning all refugees and any citizens of half a dozen majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. The administration claims that religion has nothing to do with the travel ban, but critics point to the president’s campaign trail promises of a “Muslim ban” as reason to doubt him.\n\nNow though, Iowa Congressman Steve King has thrown away pretty much all pretense of tolerance for people who are not American-born.\n\nRelated: Whatever the Courts Say, Trump’s Travel Ban Is Already Working\n\nOn Sunday, the fervently anti-immigration congressman tweeted out the statement, “We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.”\n\nIn an appearance on CNN Monday morning, King said he “meant exactly what I said.”\n\n“You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else's babies. You've got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values,” King said. “In doing so, you can grow your population, you can strengthen your culture, and you can strengthen your way of life.”\n\nFurther remarks by King ignited yet another storm of protest, though they appear to have been taken out of context. On social media, King was blasted over reports that he longs for a future America that is “that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same.”\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nHe was immediately accused of advocating some sort of ethnic cleansing of the United States. However, properly contextualized, King seems to have been arguing for more assimilation, not less.\n\n“If you go down the road a few generations, or maybe centuries, with the inter-marriage, I'd like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same,” he said.\n\n“It's the culture, not the blood,” he added. “If you could go anywhere in the world and adopt these little babies and put them into households that were already assimilated into America, those babies will grow up as American as any other baby.”\n\nThe comments, on the whole, seem likely to only further aggravate King’s already awful relationship with minority groups and immigration reform advocates, especially as he repeated his assertion that some ethnic groups have more to contribute to “Western society” than others."

    "text": "With the Congressional Budget Office expected to release its official score of his party’s proposed legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, House Speaker Paul Ryan on Sunday tried to get out in front of the agency’s expected prediction of widespread losses of health insurance coverage. In an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation Sunday morning, he explained that if millions of people go without health coverage because of the GOP plan, it won’t be because of bad policy. It will be because of freedom.\n\n“The one thing I'm certain will happen is CBO will say, ‘Well, gosh. Not as many people will get coverage,’” he told host John Dickerson. “You know why? Because this isn't a government mandate. This is not the government that makes you buy what we say you should buy and therefore the government thinks you're all going to buy it.”\n\nRelated: Is This Why the GOP Is Having Trouble Selling Its Health Care Plan?\n\nRyan insisted that despite slashing funding for Medicaid and vastly reducing the assistance low-income people receive for paying insurance premiums, that health insurance under the GOP-proposed American Health Care Act, will become more accessible. That’s because, he said, the ACHA will increase choice and competition, and thereby lower prices, presumably by at least as much as the many thousands of dollars per year that low-income Americans will lose in subsidies.\n\nIn the end, he said, if millions of Americans who now have insurance find themselves without it, it won’t be because they can’t afford it. It will be because they choose not to have it. “We're not going to make an American do what they don't want to do. You get it if you want it. That's freedom.”\n\nRyan’s view is, to say the least, not widely shared by the medical community or advocates for the populations likely to be most affected by the proposed changes to existing law. The ACHA’s proposal to replace subsidies linked to income with refundable tax credits linked to age was particularly bothersome to the American Medical Association, which has warned that the credits are too small to cover the costs of health insurance.\n\n“It is important...that the amount of credits available to individuals be sufficient to enable one to afford quality coverage. We believe that credits should be inversely related to an individual’s income,” the association’s executive vice president, Dr. James Madara, wrote in a letter to Congress. “This structure provides the greatest chance that those of the least means are able to purchase coverage. We believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee’s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of taxpayer resources.”\n\nRelated: OMB Director Mulvaney Blowing Smoke on Health Law’s Impact\n\nThe elder advocacy group AARP warned that the tax credit system would end up costing low-income seniors not yet eligible for Medicare up to $8,400 a year in increased costs and that a proposal to cut and cap Medicaid funding would effectively eliminate the last resort for many poor people seeking health coverage.\n\n“In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person, this approach to financing would likely result in overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and families unable to shoulder the costs of care without sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both – ultimately harming some of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens,” the group senior vice president for public affairs, Joyce A. Rogers, said in a letter to Congress.\n\nOn Sunday, Dickerson asked Ryan about all the opposition the plan has been facing, including from Republican senators who have called on the House to slow down rather than trying to push through a bill that, currently, doesn’t have enough support to pass in the Senate.\n\nThe Speaker said that waiting isn’t an option, claiming that the current system is in imminent danger of collapse. Also, freedom.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\n“This is historic, and it's significant,” he said. “And if we don't act, the system's going to collapse. And the beautiful thing about this plan that we're proposing, it's more freedom. It's more choices. It's more markets. It's lower prices, which gets us better access.”\n\nReturning to the pending CBO report on the ACHA, Dickerson asked again about the number of people who could be expected to lose coverage under the bill. Ryan refused to accept the premise of the question.\n\n“I can't answer that question,” he said. “It's up to people. Here's the premise of your question. Are you going to stop mandating people buy health insurance? People are going to do what they want to do with their lives because we believe in individual freedom in this country.”\n\nThe next move in this game will come Monday or Tuesday, with the CBO’s estimate of how many Americans would be forced to exercise their “freedom” to go without health insurance under ACHA."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/13/Why-Republican-Health-Care-Plan-Destined-Fail",
    "text": "“It is the general social consensus, clearly, that the laissez-faire solution for medicine is intolerable.” – Kenneth Arrow, 1963.\n\nAs Republicans struggle to find an acceptable replacement for Obamacare, a task that does not yet appear to be complete given the growing opposition to their recent proposal, they would do well to remember the words of the person who invented healthcare economics, Kenneth Arrow.\n\nProfessor Arrow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who recently passed away at the age of 95, argued that the market for healthcare is not like other markets for several reasons.\n\nHealthcare often involves large, unexpected expenses. To be able to pay these large expenses if and when they occur, people must have adequate savings or the ability to borrow when needed to cover the costs. But even that may not be enough, an individual may not have saved enough or be able to borrow enough to cover necessary healthcare costs. In the face of such uncertainty – not even knowing who will need healthcare and when – pooling money into an insurance fund and then sharing the risk of a major expenditure across individuals is a natural way to handle this uncertainty.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nBut health insurance markets have the well-known problems that are difficult to overcome. First, there is what economists call moral hazard –- people tend to take more risks when they are insured or seek healthcare for trivial ailments. The insurance company is paying, so why not? Deductibles, which make it costly to take risks or get help for minor problems, are one way to overcome the moral hazard problem.\n\nThe bigger problem is called “adverse selection.” When people are pooled together in an insurance fund some will have very high expected medical costs (due, for example, to pre-existing conditions), others will have low expected costs, and the premium they are charged will reflect average healthcare use. For the healthy, that’s a bad deal – the premiums are more than their expected health spending. So many of them won’t purchase insurance (and the emergency room is available for serious problems, and if the bill is big enough someone else will end up paying). That leaves more people with high expected health costs in the insurance pool, leading to higher premiums and more dropouts, a process that continues until only the highest cost patients are left and the premiums are unaffordable.\n\nOne way to stop this spiral to market collapse is a mandate that keeps healthy people in the insurance pool. The mandate in Obamacare wasn’t strong enough, and too many relatively healthy (and often young) people went without insurance. The mandate in the Republican proposal is even weaker and actually creates an incentive to go without insurance. The penalty for going without insurance does not occur until you sign up for insurance after a lapse, so the rational thing to do is to wait as long as possible before getting insurance. It’s hard to see how this will work.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThe presence of insurance companies in the health services market creates another problem. It means people are going to have their choices – what will be paid for, the type of care, etc. – determined by insurance companies and the policies they offer. Unlike most other goods, you can’t choose whatever health care treatment you want. The insurance company must approve it, and insurance companies will deny payment whenever possible. They have whole staffs devoted to finding reasons to deny payment, so some type of regulatory oversight is needed to ensure consumers get the care they were promised.\n\nBut the most problematic aspect of delivering healthcare in the private marketplace is that consumers do not have the information they need to make informed healthcare choices. What type of implantable heart monitor is best? If they are on sale down the road, can I trust the quality? Do I even need this procedure – are there other treatments that are equally or more effective? Doctors often disagree, if they don’t know the answers, how can I make informed choices?\n\nWe often don’t care about information problems; for example, the market for wine certainly involves a great deal of uncertainty on behalf of consumers. In many cases, people likely pay far too much for wine due to their lack of knowledge. But unlike health care, the consequences of making a bad wine choice won’t end up harming your health permanently, or maybe even causing death. When market failures have potentially severe consequences, such as in healthcare or the financial sector, regulation is needed to insulate against very costly outcomes for individuals or the economy as a whole.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nHow can the information problem be solved? One way is through professional standards, certification, and self-policing within the medical profession. We expect more from doctors than we expect from, say, car salespeople. We expect doctors to guide us in making the best possible healthcare choices, but I have no such expectation when I buy a car. Doctors could sell all sorts of unnecessary tests, follow-ups, etc. to unwitting consumers – think of all the unnecessary add-ons you are pressured to purchase after agreeing to buy a car – but we expect more from medical professionals.\n\nIn this regard, Professor Arrow made an interesting comment in an interview in 2009 when asked if anything had changed since he wrote his path-breaking paper on health economics decades ago:\n\n“If you look closely at my argument there is a sociological structure. There is a kind of sociological thesis. The market won't work -- it doesn't work well in the health context. But something else supplements the market, and the thing I put stress on in the paper are the elements that put a non-economic influence on the market: professional commitments to provide a service, to engage in services that aren't self-serving. Standards of caring decided by non-economic actors. And one problem we have now is an erosion of professional standards. In a way, there is more emphasis on markets and self-aggrandizement in the context of healthcare, and that has led to some of the problems we have today.”\n\nAnother way to overcome the information problem is to let an informed agent make decisions on your behalf. This is the role that institutions such as HMO’s are supposed to play. But HMOs make less money when consumers receive more care, and consumers do not trust HMO-type institutions to make important decisions about their health. Thus, regulatory oversight is needed to make sure that insurance companies are delivering policies that provide adequate coverage, and that consumers can get the care the pay for.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nThat does not end the long, long list of problems in healthcare markets. For example, if everyone around me is healthier, I am less likely to get sick, so there are what economists call “externalities” in these markets. When externalities are present, the private sector will not produce the socially desirable quantity of a good. Government mandates that, for example, require people to be vaccinated against some diseases can overcome this problem.\n\nWhen you put all of these problems together, especially the information problem, professor Arrow’s assertion seems clearly true. The market for healthcare does not operate like most markets. Government involvement is needed to ensure consumers get the care they need, and to ensure that care providers are not taking advantage of consumer’s lack of knowledge.\n\nOnce the need for government involvement to overcome market failures is accepted, and to me, it seems impossible to deny, the question is how well a particular healthcare proposal addresses these problems. Obamacare is not perfect, and some tweaks were needed. But it did a pretty good job of tackling these varied and difficult problems in healthcare markets.\n\nHowever, the Republican plan does not even seem to recognize the full extent of the problems in healthcare markets, and when it does, the remedies are far from adequate. Anyone who is serious about a delivering broad-based, affordable healthcare insurance should give it two bigly thumbs down."

    "text": "The director of the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget, former South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, sat for a pair of interviews on Sunday morning, in which he questioned the credibility of three of the federal government’s most respected non-partisan agencies and twisted himself into verbal knots in explaining how the proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act currently being considered by Congress would improve the nation’s health care system.\n\nMulvaney, appearing on CNN, was asked by host Jake Tapper to comment on the job growth numbers put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday, which showed unemployment shrinking to 4.7 percent even as wages increased and the economy created an estimated 235,000 jobs.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nTapper pointed out that during the campaign, Trump had repeatedly called the BLS statistics “fake” and insisted that the “real” rate of unemployment was actually as high as 40 percent. But on Friday, the White House celebrated the numbers. What changed?\n\nMulvaney began with some hand-waving about the alternative measure of unemployment known as the U6, which, unlike the more broadly cited U3, accounts for people marginally attached to the workforce and people involuntarily working only part-time.\n\n“What I think changed is you start to look at some of the underlying numbers you look at the U6 number, already boring your audience. There are things like U3, U6, what you should really look at is the number of jobs created.”\n\nIt should be noted here that there was absolutely nothing remarkable in Friday’s U6 number. It was well within the range it has occupied since prior to the election.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThen, Mulvaney accused the BLS, which is staffed by career professionals, of cooking the books during the Obama administration.\n\n“We thought for a long time, I did, that the Obama administration was manipulating the number in terms of the number of people in the workforce to make the unemployment rate that percentage rate look smaller than it actually was. We used to tell people back home the only thing you should look at is the number of jobs created.”\n\nBut if there were something magical about the number of jobs created in February, 235,000, Trump certainly wasn’t acting like it when the economy added that many jobs or more in multiple months during his presidential campaign.\n\nMulvaney was forced, in the end, to admit that, despite the administration’s change in attitude toward the BLS numbers, there is actually nothing really different about them. “The BLS did not change the way they count, I don’t think, but you can have a long conversation when you’ve got a numerator and a denominator how to arrive at a percentage.\n\nRelated: Is This Why the GOP Is Having Trouble Selling Its Health Care Plan?\n\nTapper then asked if President Trump was breaking his campaign promise not to touch Medicaid by supporting the House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, which would strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the program and repeal the expansion it underwent through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Just because you spend less money on something doesn’t mean it can’t get better,” Mulvaney said, insisting that improvements in efficiency and increased state-level control would improve the system for those using it.\n\nWhen Tapper pointed out that the ACHA’s changes would result in many million fewer Americans being enrolled in the program, Mulvaney tried to thread the needle by insisting that because people currently covered under the expansion would be allowed to remain -- but new enrollees would not be accepted -- that the bill isn’t really reducing anyone’s access to healthcare.\n\n“It doesn’t kick anybody off,” he said.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Cost of Medical Waste in America\n\nIn an interview on ABC, Mulvaney took the opportunity to criticize the well-respected Congressional Budget Office in advance of its expected release of an analysis of the ACHA’s impact on healthcare markets, expected on Monday.\n\nAsked by host George Stephanopoulos about expert analysts who expect CBO to report that as many as 15 million Americans could lose coverage under ACHA, Mulvaney joined others in the White House, like Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who have challenged the competency of the agency.\n\n“We continue to think and have for a long time that CBO is scoring the wrong thing,” he said. The congressional budget watchdog, he said, fails to consider the benefits of market competition, which he insisted the ACHA would generate, and also didn’t take into account what he predicted as the “collapse” of Obamacare.\n\nHe also took a swipe at the Joint Committee on Taxation, which last week released a report that found the repeal of multiple taxes related to the ACA would greatly benefit the wealthy, and another from the AARP, which found that it would increase costs for seniors by thousands of dollars a year.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\n“I seriously doubt that any of those analyses take into account the fact that the use of Health Savings Accounts and the lower premiums that come from competition. Look, everybody’s got skin in this game. Everybody has an interested party and they’re trying to protect their own.”\n\nIn fact, Health Savings Accounts, which allow individuals to set aside income tax free to pay for health-related expenses, are being asked to do an awful lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to the purported “improvements” to that ACHA proponents are promising.\n\nAgain addressing the changes to the Medicaid program, Mulvaney insisted, “What we’re doing is making sure that the truly indigent have care. Medicaid is still there. In fact, we think it’s going to be even better. The people who are just above Medicaid but still have difficulty buying their own premiums will not only have the refundable tax credit but they will have the ability to use HSA’s to pay for their health care on a tax-advantaged basis just like you and I get. So I don’t understand the criticisms lobbed in that fashion.”\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here:\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nFirst, the tax credits being offered under the proposed ACHA would provide much, much less money for premium payments than the existing subsidy system under the ACA.\n\nSecond, the idea that people on the cusp of qualifying for Medicaid are somehow going to find enough spare income to fund an HSA at the level needed to pay for a decent health insurance policy is laughable on its face. (Not to mention that “tax advantaged” savings for people with income too low to trigger significant tax liability is not much of a benefit.)\n\nFinally, Mulvaney presents HSAs as though they are something new and innovative when in fact they have been around in their current form since 2003, and in different manifestations since the 1990s. If they were some sort of magic bullet to help the poor pay for care, they’d have solved the health care affordability problem years ago.\n\nThe upside to Mulvaney’s appearances is that he repeatedly said that the administration views the existing proposal as a “framework” and is open to improvements offered through the amendment process in Congress.\n\nGiven the level of opposition the ACHA is generating on both sides of the aisle, it will need them."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/12/Republicans-Medicaid-and-Housing-Cuts-Deal-Double-Blow-Drug-Crisis",
    "text": "President Trump campaigned last year vowing to address the nation’s tragic epidemic of opiate addiction and overdoses and then brought it up again a week ago during his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\n“We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted,” Trump said.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nThe crisis is unmistakable: A record 33,000 people died of opioid overdoses in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and addiction to heroin and other powerful drugs is rampant. Once the scourge of inner cities and urban areas, drug addiction has now become a brutal fact of life in suburban and rural areas as well, including in New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nAnd yet, last week House Republicans and the Trump Administration unveiled austerity measures that when taken together would do incalculable harm to federal programs that assist drug addicts and the mentally ill.\n\nThe first was a House Republican proposal to strip out essential mental health and drug addiction treatment in the coming years as part of the GOP’s highly controversial replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. An estimated 1.3 million people currently receive treatment for mental health problems and substance abuse under an expanded Medicaid program in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that the Republican’s American Health Care Act would freeze and then roll back expanded Medicaid beginning in 2020, which means that many of those patients would be denied desperately needed treatment in the future. Moreover, if the Republicans prevail in overhauling the traditional Medicaid program converting it to a system of fixed, per-capita payments to the states, a far greater number of Americans could lose their mental health and drug treatment assistance in the coming years.\n\nRelated: A Plan to Drastically Cut EPA Staff and Programs Is on Trump’s Desk\n\nMedicaid pays on average nearly 50 percent of medication assisted treatment in three states with some of the biggest drug addiction problems, including Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia, according to figures compiled by the National Center on Behavioral Health. In 2014, spending by Medicaid accounted for 25 percent of all mental health spending in the U.S. and 21 percent of all substance use disorder expenditures.\n\nJoshua Sharfstein, an associate dean at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, told The Washington Post that, taken as a whole the Republican plan to replace Obamacare “is a major retreat from the effort to save lives in the opiate epidemic.”\n\nBut the problem is even more serious than that. As part of its effort to offset the cost of a major military and homeland security buildup, the Trump administration has targeted the Department of Housing and Urban Development for $7.7 billion in fiscal 2018 – a 16 percent reduction in the agency’s current $48.2 billion operating budget.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that those cuts if approved by Congress, would contribute to the loss of about 200,000 rental assistance units across the country. Funding for federal housing vouchers would plummet by about $900 million while rising housing costs and inflation would exacerbate the problem.\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nAt the same time, public housing funding for 2.1 million residents – many of them seniors or people with disabilities – would also take a hit under the budget reduction plan crafted by the Office of Management and Budget. “Reducing the availability of this crucial support would increase and prolong homelessness for vulnerable people with disabilities, families with children and others,” wrote Douglas Rice, a housing expert and a senior policy analyst at the CBPP.\n\nMental health and drug addiction experts have long contended that drug addicts who have decent, safe and affordable housing respond far better to treatment than people who are homeless or living in squalor.\n\n“Poor housing, such as housing that’s too expensive, run-down or over-crowded, can lead to poor overall health,” according to an analysis by BC Partners for Mental Health and Addiction Information, a group of seven leading health and addiction non-profit agencies. “It can also make recovery from mental health or substance problems much more difficult.”\n\nIn an interview Friday, Rice of the CBPP said that a staggering number of homeless people living on the street have significant mental health issues or substance abuse problems that are difficult to treat without them having a more stable environment.\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\n“There’s a lot of evidence showing that providing these folks with stable, affordable housing can be an important first step to securing treatment for the other issues that they face,” he said. “There’s what’s called ‘supportive housing’ which combines affordable housing with treatment and other services that these guys benefit from.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/12/Rex-Tillerson-Already-Irrelevant-or-Playing-Long-Game",
    "text": "Later this month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to host a high-profile meeting in Washington with representatives of 68 nations involved in the U.S.-led coalition to fight the Islamic State.\n\nThe conclave will be Tillerson’s first big moment at center stage as America’s top diplomat, but it remains to be seen whether the meeting on Mar. 22 can put to rest the sense that the former ExxonMobil CEO has been sidelined as a major player in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nRelated: 'CEO' Tillerson Faces Internal Skeptics, Crisis-Battling White House\n\nIn mid-February, Tillerson did attend a gathering of G20 foreign ministers in Germany, but he largely avoided the press and didn’t make much of a splash. And there has been a steady stream of stories suggesting that after only a couple of months on the job, the secretary has been cut out of the decision-making process, with foreign policy being run by a close cadre of Trump advisers led by White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThat line of thinking is not without supporting evidence.\n\nTillerson was all set to hire Elliot Abrams, a foreign policy veteran who had served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, but the appointment was nixed by President Trump. In a piece last May in the conservative Weekly Standard, Abrams had written: \"The party has nominated someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States.\"\n\nThat apparently did not sit well with the man who did win and did become the Commander-in-Chief. Abrams was also one of the neo-cons who pushed for the invasion of Iraq, which Trump railed against during the campaign. So Tillerson still does not have a No. 2.\n\nRelated: 10 Things to Know About Rex Tillerson, Trump’s Choice for Secretary of State\n\nTillerson and officials at Foggy Bottom were also not consulted before Trump issued his first so-called travel ban — which had to be pulled and retooled in the face of fierce opposition and negative judicial decisions — and the secretary of state was out of the loop when the decision was made to mount a special-ops raid in Yemen in which a Navy Seal was killed along with 25 civilians, including nine children.\n\nWhen Trump conferred with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Feb. 15, Tillerson was flying to Germany, but his designated representative was shut out of the meeting. Tillerson also didn’t take part in meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAnd the State Department is bracing for a significant reduction in budget and staff — one that Tillerson fundamentally supports, according to Bloomberg.\n\nOn Thursday, according to New York magazine, the State Dept. was unaware that Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was in Washington meeting with Kushner, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn.\n\nIn February, Eliot Cohen, the academic and adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, wrote in The Atlantic: If Kushner “becomes foreign governments’ chief conduit into the administration, it undermines the bureaucracies and—because one may doubt that he is surrounded by State Department notetakers—opens the way for more miscommunication and failed coordination. There is a good reason for those pesky protocols and routines, and for the discipline of good order. Maybe a Nixon and a Kissinger could run foreign policy cutting everyone else out, but Trump is no Nixon, and there is no Kissinger in the offing.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Surprisingly Strong Defense and Foreign Policy Team\n\nThere have been multiple reports about a demoralized State Department, and on Thursday, Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted:\n\nGave book talk today to an unusually large audience at State Dept. After, a SES person told me, \"We've literally nothing else to do.\" — Micah Zenko (@MicahZenko) March 9, 2017\n\nIt may be too early to count out the press-shy Tillerson, who thus far has kept his head down and reportedly nurtured the same methodical approach to learning his new job that served him well as a CEO. But reports suggest that the new secretary of state may not seek to pursue a grand vision for U.S. diplomacy and global influence. “Instead,” the Bloomberg report said, “he sees himself as a manager with an eye toward corporate-style reform, an outgrowth of his four decades in the private sector, according to those familiar with his thinking.”\n\nOne scenario that Cohen, now director of Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, laid out (and rejected) is that “Trump, overwhelmed by a leadership task far beyond his experience and personality, will focus his efforts on infrastructure projects and the like and quietly concede the direction of foreign policy to his sober secretaries of state and defense….”\n\nThat could still happen, and Tillerson could finally take charge. Yet sometimes if you’re playing a long game, you can take too long."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/11/Why-GOP-Having-Trouble-Selling-Its-Health-Care-Plan",
    "text": "Maybe it’s sleep deprivation due to all-night committee meetings spent contemplating the American Health Care Act, or maybe it’s just simple giddiness at the prospect of feeling as though they are at long last on the cusp of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Whatever the explanation, over the last few days a lot of Republicans have made comments about medical care, the American poor and basic concepts like, well, health insurance that have given critics reason to question whether their reform effort is really meant to deliver higher quality, lower cost health care to the American people.\n\nTake House Speaker Paul Ryan, the man who rose to prominence in the GOP by dint of his supposed mastery of policy arcana. In a presentation to reporters on Thursday, he walked them through what he described as the “fatal conceit” of the Affordable Care Act: Healthy people buying insurance who turn out not to need care in the near term are “subsidizing” sicker people, who do need care.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan – and 3 Big Losers\n\nThat, as more than a few people quickly pointed out on social media and in the mainstream press, is pretty much how insurance is supposed to work. (And particularly in the U.S., where life expectancies are relatively long, it pays to remember that the vast majority of younger, healthier people subsidizing older, sicker people will one day be older and sicker themselves.) If Ryan is opposed to the healthy subsidizing the sick, does he really believe in properly functioning health insurance at all?\n\nBut Ryan was far from the only Republican to raise some eyebrows over the past week. Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chair of the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, suggested in an interview that poor Americans worried about losing health care if the Affordable Care Act is replaced with a less generous plan might just be a little too profligate in their non-healthcare spending.\n\n“Americans have choices, and they’ve got to make a choice,” he said on CNN. “So rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.”\n\nFor most Americans, of course, a new iPhone is something they might buy every few years, and typically at the cost of less than a month’s worth of insurance premiums. After Chaffetz’s appearance on CNN, the woman planning to run against him in 2018 reported a huge spike in donations to her campaign.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\nThen, there’s Florida Rep. Mike DeSantis, who said in an interview that cancer patients who lose coverage under ACHA need not worry, because they can go to the emergency room.\n\nOn CNN, DeSantis was asked about the case of a young woman who self-identified as a Republican. She said that she suffers from cancer and that she would lose access to treatment without the ACA’s expanded access to Medicaid.\n\n“Well, if you remember when Obamacare was enacted, there were millions of people who had their health care canceled,” DeSantis said. “And so there are stories of people who had certain needs, cancer or whatnot, who got pushed into policies that they didn’t want, and then they didn’t have the same coverage that they had because of the broken promise ... I would say though, and people who supported Obamacare used to make this point a lot before it passed, there really is no lack of health care. If people really need it, they show up to the emergency room, they do get care, it just gets passed on to other folks.”\n\nOnce again, the very idea of health insurance and the need for proper medical care seems to be in question here.\n\nRelated: The GOP Health Plan: A Giant Step in the Wrong Direction or Merely Step One?\n\nThen there was Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, who seemed to temporarily forget some fundamental facts about how babies are made. During a mark-up of the GOP’s proposed ACA replacement bill, Shimkus was complaining about the current law’s mandates when he was interrupted by Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Doyle.\n\nDoyle: What mandate in the Obamacare bill does he take issue with? Certainly not with pre-existing conditions, or caps on benefits or letting your child stay on the policy until 26, so I’m curious what is it we’re mandating?\n\nShimkus: What about men having to purchase prenatal care? Is that not correct? And should they?\n\nDoyle: There’s no such thing as a la carte insurance, John.\n\nShimkus: That’s the point. We want the consumer to be able to go to the insurance market and be able to negotiate on a plan.\n\nDoyle: There’s not a single insurance company in the world that does that. You’re talking about something that doesn’t exist.\n\nOnline, people relentlessly reminded Shimkus of just why women need pre-natal care, and the mechanics of how they get to that point. More broadly, Shimkus was reminded that insurance works for everyone who has a policy, whether they need a particular service or not.\n\nBut perhaps the oddest and most disturbing comment came last week, from Rep. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who is himself a doctor.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\n“Just like Jesus said, ‘The poor will always be with us,’” he told the medical website Stat. “There is a group of people that just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.”\n\n“Just, like, homeless people … I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just don’t want health care,” he said. “The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I’m not judging, I’m just saying socially that’s where they are.”"

Now these missiles could be used to wipe out Russia's nukes buried deep underground.\n\n\"Because of improvements in the killing power of US submarine-launched ballistic missiles, those submarines now patrol with more than three times the number of warheads needed to destroy the entire fleet of Russian land-based missiles in their silos,\" wrote Hans M. Kristensen, Matthew McKinzie, and Theodore A. Postol, the authors of the report.\n\nBut the US has even bigger nukes which sit in missile silos underground as ICBMs. Historically, these missiles would have been used for destroying Russia's ICBMs, but since submarines can handle that now, the US can focus its big nukes on obliterating underground hardened nuclear shelters — the kind Kremlin officials would hide out in during an attack.\n\nRelated: What Is THAAD?

This places a whole lot of responsibility on the shoulders of Russian military officials.\n\n\"The combination of this lack of Russian situational awareness, dangerously short warning times, high-readiness alert postures, and the increasing US strike capacity has created a deeply destabilizing and dangerous strategic nuclear situation,\" argues the piece.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/10/Clock-Starts-Ticking-Possible-Treasury-Debt-Ceiling-Crisis",
    "text": "The clock is now ticking on the Treasury Department’s efforts to avert a first ever default on the nearly $20 trillion national debt, and some experts say Congress and the Trump Administration have until late summer or early fall to act before the problem reaches crisis proportions.\n\nOn Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to persuade the House to raise the legal debt ceiling above $20 trillion “at its first opportunity.” At the same time, Mnuchin announced that the Treasury has begun taking “extraordinary measures” to buy the government additional time before the government exhausts its borrowing authority.\n\nRelated: Trump Could Face His First Fiscal Crisis Over Raising the Debt Ceiling\n\nRaising the debt ceiling is one of the most politically onerous and thankless tasks that is necessary periodically to allow the Treasury to borrow more in order to repay China, Japan and other U.S. creditors. Because the government spends more money than it takes in, raising the debt ceiling is also essential to keep cash flowing to operate defense and domestic government programs and to make sure that millions of Americans continue to receive their Social Security checks on time.\n\nThe task almost invariably becomes enmeshed in larger partisan disputes over budget and tax policy and frequently raises the specter of a partial government shutdown if left unresolved.\n\nIn his letter, Mnuchin revealed that the Treasury Department was suspending the sale of certain state and local securitie, a task the Treasury routinely performs to assist state and localities in meeting their obligations. By doing so, the Treasury technically slows the rate of growth of government borrowing.\n\nOther maneuvers the Treasury likely will take to forestall the threat of default include delaying the reinvestment of assets in the Federal Employees’ Retirement System G-Fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the civil service and postal retirement fund.\n\nThose and other steps would likely enable the Treasury to continue making all payments until at least mid-August or early September, but it's unclear what would happen beyond then, according to some budget analysts.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nBut not everyone is so sanguine. David Stockman, the storied White House budget director during the Reagan administration, insists that the Treasury’s financial picture is direr than Mnuchin is letting on and that “they are burning through cash at the Treasury like drunken sailors.”\n\n“In the first 46 days of the Trump administration they burned through $294 billion of cash,” after starting with $382 billion, Stockman told Fox News this week. If they continue at last year’s rate, he said, “They will be out of cash by Memorial Day” at the end of May.\n\nTrump and the Republicans will need some support from Democrats to raise the debt ceiling since many conservatives refuse to support a boost in borrowing authority. Stockman said there is currently “no pathway” to a majority of Congress agreeing to raise the debt ceiling given the poisonous divide between Republicans and Democrats over policies ranging from immigration to health care reform.\n\n“By May, the Republican Party is going to be in tatters, and there will be no majority to raise the debt ceiling, and then the rubber will meet the road,” he said. “This debt ceiling crisis is going to take down the whole system.”\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nIn 2015, Congress and the Obama administration declared a temporary truce on debt ceiling politics by agreeing to suspend the debt limit until March 15 of this year – just a few days from now. At that point, the Treasury technically will be unable to borrow additional funds without the consent of Congress and the White House.\n\nPresident Trump created a stir in financial circles during the 2016 campaign by lightly dismissing the importance of the debt ceiling. He even suggested that if push came to shove, he would try to negotiate down the debt with the country’s biggest creditors. And White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former Tea Party conservative House member, has long voiced skepticism of the dangers of the Treasury defaulting on its debt, suggesting that Congress and the administration could “prioritize” repayments of loans and federal expenditures.\n\nBut Mnuchen, a wealthy former Wall Street banker and hedge fund manager, takes the debt ceiling deadly seriously. He made it clear in his letter to Ryan that the debt ceiling demands immediate attention, even while the GOP-controlled Congress and White House are struggling to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s ‘Historic’ $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\n“As I said in my confirmation hearing, honoring the full faith and credit of our outstanding debt is a critical commitment,” Mnuchin told Ryan. “I encourage Congress to raise the debt limit at the first opportunity so we can proceed with our joint priorities.”\n\nThe Treasury has had close brushes with default over the decades. In August 2011, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the federal government’s Triple-A rating after Congress and President Barack Obama deadlocked for weeks over a budget deal, and the Treasury came within an eyelash of defaulting"

    "text": "Just outside Portland, Maine, there’s a 15,000-square-foot warehouse that’s packed with reasons the U.S. health care system costs so much: Shelves climb floor to ceiling, stacked with tubs overflowing with unopened packages of syringes, diabetes supplies and shiny surgical instruments that run hundreds of dollars apiece. There are boxes of IV fluids and bags of ostomy supplies and kits with everything you’d need to perform an obstetrics surgery.\n\nThis, however, isn’t a story of about the crippling price of medical supplies. This is about the high cost of medical supplies that hospitals throw away.\n\nRelated: Why a Third of American Health Care Costs Are Considered Unnecessary\n\nOn a recent snowy day the warehouse’s 65-year-old proprietor, Elizabeth McLellan, gave an indignant accounting: She yanked a urinary catheter out of one bin. It’s unopened and has an expiration date of July 2018. “There’s no reason to get rid of this.” A box of 30 new feeding bags has an August 2019 expiration date. The same type sells on Amazon.com for $129.\n\nThat surgical stapler? It’s unopened. The same model sells online for $189. And McLellan simply shook her head over a set of a dozen long thin laparoscopic surgery instruments that some hospital discarded. Similar used tools can go for hundreds of dollars.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with these, nothing wrong with any of these,” she said.\n\nTen years ago, McLellan, a registered nurse, shocked to see what hospitals were tossing out, began asking them to give her their castoffs instead. In 2009 she launched Partners for World Health, a nonprofit that now has four warehouses throughout Maine. Today, she and hundreds of volunteers collect medical equipment and supplies from a network of hospitals and medical clinics, sort them and eventually ship containers full of them to countries like Greece, Syria and Uganda.\n\n“This is money.” McLellan said, extending her arm to the vast array of supplies. “This is one of the reasons why your health insurance is so expensive.”\n\nThe vexing riddle of how to make health care more affordable has seldom been more front and center on the national stage. President Trump and Republican lawmakers are wrestling with the future of the Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people obtain health insurance. But most Americans would rather their legislators focus on bringing down health care costs, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Two-thirds of those surveyed said reducing such costs should be the “top” health care priority for Trump and the Republican-led Congress.\n\nTalk to experts and many agree that waste would be a good place to start. In 2012 the National Academy of Medicine estimated the U.S. health care system squandered $765 billion a year, more than the entire budget of the Defense Department. Dr. Mark Smith, who chaired the committee that authored the report, said the waste is “crowding out” spending on critical infrastructure needs, like better roads and public transportation. The annual waste, the report estimated, could have paid for the insurance coverage of 150 million American workers — both the employer and employee contributions.\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\n“It’s unconscionable that we’re not only wasting money in health care but in doing so are sacrificing other important social needs,” Smith said.\n\nSmith’s committee blames the obvious villains — overtreatment, excess administrative costs and high prices — for most of the fat in the system. Left untallied, however, are the discards that arrive in waves into McLellan’s warehouses, most of which would otherwise end up in landfills. McLellan estimates the goods her group has right now are worth $20 million. Sure, that’s a rounding error in the overall waste tab, but it starts being real money if you add up the discards of all the nation’s medical facilities.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, for instance, recently estimated that in a single year the hospital wasted $2.9 million in neurosurgery supplies alone. Nearly $3 million. On wasted supplies. In one department.\n\nLast year Partners sent seven containers overseas, each weighing up to 15,000 pounds and with an estimated value of up to $250,000. One is being sent to Syria this week. It includes an ultrasound machine ($25,000), a dozen trocars ($4,400) and an infant warmer ($3,995).\n\nMedShare, a Georgia-based nonprofit more than 10 times the size of Partners, sent 156 containers of discarded medical supplies to developing countries last year, each one worth as much as $175,000. As lawmakers debate, ProPublica is setting off to document the rarely examined — and mind-boggling — ways your health care dollars are frittered away. Our first stop: the world of “medical surplus.”\n\nThere’s a display case in the Partners headquarters that sums up the heedless wealth of American health care. On one side are medical supplies McLellan brought home from Bangladesh: a yellowed plastic respirator mask, dirty tubing and a bloodstained square of gauze that’s brown and stiff from being washed and reused over and over again. Above them a sign reads, “Shared By Thousands.” On the other side are the same items, sterile and new, the discards of local health care facilities in the U.S.\n\nMcLellan once worked as a nurse in Saudi Arabia and her wardrobe reflects her extensive travels in the developing world: velveteen pants from China, a chunky sea rock necklace from Senegal and bangles from Ethiopia. Places that welcome our medical largesse.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan – and 3 Big Losers\n\nAt the back of her office, she pushed through a set of swinging double doors that led to her disposable medical supplies warehouse, a room the size of a gymnasium, with 20-foot ceilings and glassy concrete floors.\n\nDonations from throughout Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts come in through a loading dock at the back. McLellan calls it “golden trash” and it generally falls into a handful of categories: equipment discarded for upgraded models, supplies tossed after a hospital changed vendors, or materials donated by the families of patients who have died. Other items are past their expiration dates or were swept out by strict infection control procedures, but remain safely usable.\n\nMcLellan grabs a bag from a haphazard, 10-foot mound of boxes and bulging sacks waiting to be sorted. Its contents, she says, came from a single room in a hospital’s intensive care unit. She dumps the bag out onto a table like a kid pouring out a pillowcase full of Halloween candy. The stuff rains down into a pile that’s three square feet: Handfuls of unopened and unexpired sterile needles, two dozen sterile syringes, packets of alcohol and antiseptic pads, IV tubing; a roll of tape that’s never been used, a bag of IV solution that expires in September 2018, 14 saline flushes that expire in 2019, an unopened package of suction catheters and a pulse oximeter adapter.\n\n“This is normal,” she said. “This is every hospital.”\n\nMcLellan started her nonprofit after watching patient rooms being cleaned out at Maine Medical Center, where she was a nurse administrator. When patients were discharged, hospital staff threw out everything, including unopened supplies. McLellan got permission from the hospital’s CEO to put out bins to save the discarded items.\n\nA year and a half later, she’d gathered more than 11,000 pounds of supplies and equipment in her house. Today, Partners has three paid employees — McLellan is a volunteer — and an annual budget of $357,000, most of it from individual donations. Hundreds of volunteers pitch in. Similar nonprofits have sprung up around the country.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Donald Madison, 47, Paul Farren, 69, and William Silveira, 85, picked up a used anesthesia machine, an exam table and other items at a Maine Medical Center storage facility and brought them to a different Partners’ warehouse stuffed with medical hardware: a sea of new-looking wheelchairs, a shiny mountain of walkers and canes and neat rows of IV pumps. The biomedical equipment room has ultrasound machines, anesthesia machines, laparoscopic surgery towers and more. Biomedical engineers check out each piece before it is sent on to a country in need.\n\nMadison, a supervisor at a retail pharmacy, said it’s easy to get disgusted by the waves of wasted medical goods pouring through the warehouse. He grabbed a $30 walker from the pile. “We’ll get 400 more of them this year,” he said. “Why do we need everyone on Medicare to get a new walker?”\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nAnd those pallets of adult diapers stacked high on a shelf? He sells the same type at his pharmacy for $11.99 per package or more. Farren recalled one time they picked up about 100 unopened packages of diapers from the home of a patient who had died. “It was ridiculous,” he said.\n\nMcLellan is sensitive about the built-in tension of her mission. The hospitals are casting off useful supplies that would otherwise be sent to a landfill. But they are also donating items that are desperately needed in the developing world. “They are trying to be good stewards in our community and in their world,” she said.\n\nOn the flip side, she can’t look past the waste. She said she could fill 15 shipping containers now if she had the $25,000 it cost to send each one overseas.\n\nHospital officials either declined to comment or, sometimes sheepishly, said some of the waste was unavoidable. Elton Cole, the supply chain manager at Stephens Memorial Hospital in western Maine, said some items, such as a torn exam table, must be replaced to meet infection control guidelines. Same goes for those supplies left in patient rooms. At Stephens, he said, the supplies in the room, such as bandages or gloves, are typically included in the room charge and not billed directly to patients.\n\nHealth care finance experts say while patients might not see the cost in their bills, the wasted supplies boost a hospital’s overhead, which in turn makes everyone’s costs higher.\n\nThe waste “contributes a lot to the cost of health care,” Cole said. “It’s pretty phenomenal the tons of product we’re shipping out to Elizabeth’s group.”\n\nPatricia Fallows, who organizes the University of Vermont Medical Center donations to Partners, sent ProPublica a list of the typical shipment. Among the 100 items are a Medline Skin Staple Remover ($100), a box of Carefusion Blood Sets ($100 for 10) and three cases of unexpired Ethicon sutures ($431 per box). (ProPublica is using the list price of the products online, since the prices hospitals and other medical facilities pay vary widely depending on their individual deals with suppliers.) Officials at the medical center said the waste is a tiny percentage of their budget and some of it is unavoidable.\n\nWe called the National Rural Health Association in Leawood, Kansas, to see if they could use anything on this list.\n\nRelated: GOP Health Care Plan Would Cost the States Billions in Lost Medicaid Funds\n\n“Oh my gosh!” said Brock Slabach, the vice president for member services. “Some of the equipment I know folks would be interested in.”\n\nSlabach said more than 600 rural hospitals are so strapped financially they risk closure and according to the data, some may be uncomfortably similar to facilities in Algeria and Bangladesh. Wealthier hospitals’ waste could help them stay afloat.\n\n“Every little bit helps,” he said. “None of these things will cure the entire problem altogether. But it would be helpful to meet a need in a community.”\n\nUnfortunately, quantifying what’s being squandered is difficult. There is scant research, so it’s easy for hospitals to say it doesn’t add up to much.\n\nDr. Corinna Zygourakis, the chief neurosurgery resident at UCSF, who has studied operating room waste, said hospitals may not like what they’d find. “It’s not nice to say, ‘Hey, look at the amount of money we’re wasting.”\n\nShe decided to study waste after a medical mission trip to Mexico in 2015. At UCSF it was common to set out an array of disposable surgical instruments in the sterile field of the operating room just in case a surgeon needed them. Often the surgeon wouldn’t even touch the instruments, but they, nevertheless, had to be discarded. In Mexico, they wouldn’t have been.\n\nZygourakis and a team of colleagues tracked 58 neurosurgeries at UCSF and tallied the unused supplies that were discarded. In 26 surgeries, all the blood clotting materials weren’t used, for a total of $3,749. In 16, an expensive tissue adhesive wasn’t used at a cost of $3,495. Screws were wasted on three cases, totaling $3,144. The items marked as wasted were not billed to patients, and were donated whenever possible, she said.\n\nBut the study’s findings, published in Journal of Neurosurgery in 2016, were eye-opening: The public hospital wasted an estimated $968 per neurosurgery case, which amounted to about $2.9 million over the course of a year.\n\nUCSF reviewed all the preference cards for each surgeon, which specify how the operating room should be set up before each operation. The hospital now makes sure the set-up doesn’t include supplies that aren’t actually needed, preventing a significant amount of the waste.\n\nIn a separate study in the December edition of JAMA Surgery, Zygourakis and her colleagues showed each UCSF surgeon his or her direct costs per procedure in comparison to other surgeons in the institution. Most doctors were unaware of operating-room costs. Then they gave them an incentive: Their departments would get a bonus if they reduced costs by at least 5 percent.\n\nThe median surgical supply costs dropped by 6.5 percent in the group of surgeons who participated — a savings of about $836,000 over one year — while the control group’s costs increased by almost 7.5 percent.\n\n“It’s really important to make people aware of this,” Zygourakis said. “The younger generation of physicians and surgeons do care about these things. We do realize we have limited resources and want to see how we can provide the most and best care to the most number of patients.”\n\nBack in Maine, McLellan said she would love for the medical community to put her out of business by cutting the waste and passing the savings on to patients. She’s invited hospital CEOs to visit her warehouses, to see the vast display of wasted health care dollars. So far none have come.\n\n“I want to go talk to Trump,” McLellan said. “Trump wants to figure out how to do this business in a different way, how to be more cost effective. I’m sure he doesn’t understand what the waste is. Not this kind of waste. People don’t get it until they see how much is wasted.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on ProPublica.

    "text": "Amid concerns that Russia helped sway the 2016 presidential election, several states are considering legislation that would bar companies with significant foreign ties from contributing money in state campaigns.\n\nA long-standing federal statute bars noncitizens and foreign companies from donating directly to candidates or political parties at the federal, state and local levels. Another law prohibits businesses from directly donating to federal-level candidates or political parties.\n\nRelated: If France Elects Le Pen, Another Country Will Have Been Scared Stupid\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case cleared the way for corporations and unions to pay for political ads made independently of candidates’ campaigns. The high court ruled that corporations and unions are associations of U.S. citizens with a First Amendment right to political expression.\n\nHoping to take the decision a step further, proponents of bills under consideration in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Washington state would bar political spending by businesses in which non-U.S. citizens have a significant ownership stake.\n\n“If a company is owned and controlled by foreign nationals, then I think we really have to take a hard look at how that is consistent with the existing law on the books that says foreign nationals aren’t allowed to spend money in our elections,” said Federal Election Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, who has been testifying in support of the idea at the state level after the FEC deadlocked on a similar proposal.\n\nSponsors of the legislation aren’t sure how much foreign money makes its way into state elections, because under current law it doesn’t have to be disclosed. But there are several recent examples of companies with foreign ties spending significant sums at the state level.\n\nThe ride-hailing company Uber, along with its competitor Lyft, together spent $9 million on a 2016 ballot initiative in Austin, Texas, that would have overturned the city’s requirement that drivers for the companies undergo fingerprint-based background checks. The Chinese ride-hailing company Didi invested $100 million in Lyft, and Uber announced a few weeks after the election that Saudi Arabia had secured a 5 percent stake in the company with a $3.5 billion investment. Airbnb, the short-term rental company owned in part by Russia-based company DST Global, gave $10 million to its super PAC to run ads on New York state lawmakers’ positions on short-term rentals during the 2016 election.\n\nBut critics say having some foreign ties — especially minimal ones — should not disqualify corporations from participating in the political process.\n\n“Corporations have a right to speak about politics. It’s a strange calculus that says we’re going to sacrifice the rights of the 95 percent American ownership for the 5 percent foreign ownership,” said Allen Dickerson with the Center for Competitive Politics, a First Amendment group that supports the Citizens United decision.\n\nHow Much Is Too Much?\n\nThe proposals vary in the percentage of foreign ownership that would bar a corporation from political participation.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nIn Massachusetts, the proposed prohibition would block companies from donating to super PACs or running political ads if they have a single foreign owner who owns 5 percent or more of the company, or multiple foreign owners who combined own 20 percent or more of the company. Super PACs, or political action committees, can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, but cannot contribute directly to campaigns or political parties or coordinate their political advertising with either.\n\nA Connecticut bill imposes similar requirements. The Washington state measure would apply to businesses that are majority-owned by foreigners. And a Maryland bill would prevent any company whose principal place of business is outside the U.S. from spending money on state ballot initiatives.\n\n“Certainly a company owned by more than 50 percent foreign nationals … raises a very sharp question of who is using the leverage of corporate treasury to influence democracy,” said Ron Fein with Free Speech for People, which fights corporate spending in politics and helped draft the Massachusetts bill. “We think companies with less than 50 percent run that same danger.”\n\nIn a hearing on the Washington bill, Republican Sen. Kirk Pearson questioned whether any “foreign country would care about my election in the 39th District.”\n\nBut while big ad buys and contributions are still rare in legislative races in most states, statewide elections and ballot initiatives are attracting more cash.\n\nSpending in state elections has been growing steadily since 2000, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks spending in state races. Adjusting for inflation, candidates in 2000 collected nearly $1.2 billion in contributions compared with $2.3 billion in 2014, the last major election year for which there is complete data.\n\nU.S. businesses also are becoming more international. According to data from the Federal Reserve, foreign ownership of U.S. corporate stock has grown from about 5 percent in 1982 to 26 percent in 2015.\n\nThose two trends are helping fuel the debate.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\n“The board of a public company generally conceives of themselves as working for the shareholders,” said John C. Coates, a professor at Harvard Law School who testified in favor of the bill in Connecticut. “That affects the policy decisions the company supports, the candidates they may support, lobbying on certain laws that may affect their business model, ideas about what countries it wants to engage in trade with — all of those are affected by having a significant foreign owner.”\n\nDefending Citizens United\n\nJim Manley, a lawyer with the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank that has filed a lawsuit to overturn a Massachusetts law that bars corporations from giving directly to state candidates, said the bills ask businesses to give up too much.\n\n“The problem is what that says to corporations is if you allow foreigners to buy stock in your company, you’re giving up the corporation’s First Amendment rights,” Manley said. “If I own a company with my friend who’s a foreign national, I shouldn’t be prohibited and the corporation shouldn’t be totally banned from speech just because a foreign national has a vote on how the corporation spends its money.”\n\nBoth Manley and Dickerson of the Center for Competitive Politics suspect the real intent of the proposals is to undermine the Citizens United decision. “How much of this is an attempt to prevent indirectly what we can’t do directly, which is prevent businesses from speaking? I understand there are people who don’t like Citizens United, but it’s the law,” Dickerson said.\n\nSupporters of the bills deny that charge. Weintraub opposes the Citizens Uniteddecision, but she argues that state efforts to limit foreign influence honor the logic behind it.\n\n“This is just trying to put meat on the bones. What does it mean to be an association of citizens and when are corporations not an association of citizens?” she said. “When is foreign ownership too much?”\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Ted Kennedy Jr., who sponsored the bill in Connecticut, said that a disclosure requirement might be a middle ground between supporters and opponents of spending restrictions. “Citizens deserve to know who is making these contributions,” he said.\n\nCompliance Difficulties\n\nAnother potential pitfall of the legislation, according to critics, is that it would be difficult for corporations to certify a level of foreign ownership. Stocks are routinely traded, they argue, and large investment houses make purchases on behalf of thousands of people.\n\nDickerson said the FEC policies already in place for wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign companies target what is most important: that PAC money comes from American operations and that Americans make the decisions about how it is spent.\n\n“There is a tendency in the legislative and political process to underappreciate both how interconnected American businesses are with the larger global economy and the difficulty of parsing these things out at that level of detail,” Dickerson said.\n\nBut Coates said companies already know if 5 percent or more of their stock is foreign-owned because under federal law they must report any purchase of that size, as well as the nationality of the buyer, to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, he said, publicly traded companies already collect that kind of information on stockholders for their annual shareholder meetings.\n\nState Sen. Andy Billig, the Washington Democrat who is pushing legislation there, said the claim that some companies don’t know who their owners are only strengthens his case. If they can’t figure it out, he said, “then they should not be allowed to participate in campaigns.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

    "text": "There’s a flipside to everything, and that goes for the very good news about the US economy embodied in Friday’s strong jobs report issued by the Department of Labor. The addition of 235,000 jobs to the economy, rising wages, falling unemployment and the return of workers to the labor force are unquestionably positive developments in that they signal strengthening economic growth. But they are bad news for the federal deficit and debt.\n\nThat’s because the signs of a strengthening economy from the jobs report make it much more likely that the Federal Reserve’s policy makers on the Federal Open Market Committee will vote later this month to raise interest rates, and that they may well do so two times more before 2017 is over.\n\nRelated: Medicare Could Save Nearly $16 Billion a Year Negotiating Drug Prices\n\nIn and of itself, that isn’t a bad thing. Rates are still sitting near historic lows, and raising them isn’t likely to have major negative effects on the economy. However, it does mean that as rates rise and the federal government keeps borrowing money to finance deficit spending and to roll over existing debt, both at increasingly higher rates of interest, the amount of money the country spends on debt service will take up a larger and larger share of the federal budget.\n\n“This is one reason that we can’t really count on economic growth to fix all our problems because it has offsetting effects,” said Marc Goldwein, a senior vice president with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “Faster growth is always better than slower growth, but it’s not a pure win for the federal budget. There are offsetting effects in the form of higher interest payments and larger Social Security benefits.”\n\nTo be sure, this doesn’t have to be so. If Congress were willing to find a way to increase federal revenues, the percentage of the national outlay on debt service as a share of the budget could be kept steady. Likewise, if Congress were willing to spend less in order to reduce or eliminate the deficit, the Treasury wouldn’t need to add to the debt burden.\n\nBut judging from the proposals emanating from both the Trump White House (Trillion dollar infrastructure spending! Massive defense buildup!) and from Congress (Big tax cuts for the wealthy! Bigger tax cuts for business!) federal revenues are headed down, not up, and both the deficit and the debt are likely to increase.\n\nRelated: Trump Uses His ‘Discredit Tactic’ on CBO to Hedge Against Negative Report\n\nThat means that for every dollar in taxes Americans send to the Treasury in April, a little more is going to go to debt service, and less is going to go to the services delivered by the federal government. In Fiscal 2016, according to the Treasury Department, the federal government paid $433 billion in interest on its outstanding debt of nearly $20 trillion.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says rising interest rates have a clear and dramatic effect on the Treasury Department’s interest payments. In the first five months of Fiscal 2017, the government had already spent $188 billion on interest payments.\n\nIn an analysis last year, the Capitol Hill budget watchdog agency wrote:\n\nIf interest rates on all types of Treasury securities were 1 percentage point higher each year through 2026 than is projected in the baseline and all other economic variables were unchanged, the government’s interest costs would be substantially larger. The difference would amount to only $16 billion in 2016 because most marketable government debt is in the form of securities that have maturities greater than one year. As the Treasury replaced maturing securities, however, the budgetary effects of higher interest rates would mount. Added costs from higher interest rates on the debt projected in CBO’s baseline would reach $200 billion in 2026 under this scenario.\n\nThe cumulative impact is even more dramatic, CBO notes. “In sum, if interest rates were 1 percentage point higher than projected in CBO’s baseline, the deficit would worsen progressively over the projection period by amounts increasing from $38 billion in 2016 to $260 billion in 2026. The cumulative deficit would be $1.6 trillion higher over the 2017–2026 period.”\n\nRelated: Will CBO Deal a Death Blow to the GOP Health Care Plan?\n\nGoldwein of CRFB explains, “The interest feedback is going to be so large is because the debt is so large. If your debt is low, a one percent increase doesn’t have a big effect. But when your debt is high, the effect can be large.”\n\nTo protect against interest rate risk, he said, the best thing the country could do would be to reduce the national debt, if not on an absolute basis, then at least as a share of Gross Domestic Product."

    "text": "The French, along with the rest of Europe, were on the edges of their seats before the American elections last autumn: Who will it be—a right-wing populist disrupter or a centrist favoring liberal economics, open borders, global institutions, and a foreign policy that rests on longstanding alliances?\n\nNow it’s our turn to watch and wonder as the first round of France’s presidential elections approaches. While numerous contenders will be on the April 23rd ballot, there are two names to watch. One is the Front National’s Marine Le Pen, a vigorous nationalist and the closest the French have to Donald Trump. The other is Emmanuel Macron, a centrist defector from François Hollande’s socialist government who has surged swiftly to the fore after creating his own political movement a year ago called, En Marche!\n\nRelated: Macron Consolidates Lead Over Le Pen in French Election Polls\n\nThe winner will be setting the political, economic and cultural course for France and perhaps the rest of Europe and its allies for years to come.\n\nThe emergence of these two as front-runners follows months of uncertainty and some unexpected political casualties. Now the opinion surveys are becoming a lot clearer. A Harris Interactive poll released Thursday has Macron taking 26 percent of the first-round tally to Le Pen’s 25 percent. That’s a gain of 6 percentage points for the 39-year-old Macron in the past two weeks.\n\nIn a May 7 runoff between Macron and Le Pen, which seems extremely likely, Macron will likely trounce Le Pen, 65 percent to 35 percent, the Harris poll indicates. But French politics have proven as volatile as America’s during this campaign season. It’s far too soon to count Le Pen out.\n\nThere’s a lot at stake in the French results for Americans. Starting at the top, the strength of the trans–Atlantic alliance hangs in the balance. While Macron is a staunch believer in the European Union, Le Pen is radically opposed to it—and the euro, too. Many analysts assert that if she is the Élysée Palace’s next resident, it’s the end of the European project altogether.\n\nA splintering Europe is a weaker Europe, which is the last thing Washington needs to maintain global security. If the Trans–Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership dies along with its Pacific counterpart, the U.S. goal of a unified trade regime based on free-market principles will come to nothing. The alternative will be a pasta bowl of separately agreed bilateral accords--a Commerce Department nightmare. A divided Continent will complicate Washington’s trans–Atlantic ties economically.\n\nRelated: Dollar Rises as Euro Dips on French Election Development\n\nOn Monday, the EU announced in Brussels that members agreed to institutionalize joint military training—a move that would please the Pentagon. If Le Pen goes to the second round and wins, that deal is off the table. De Gaulle-like, she’s on the record promising to pull France out of the NATO alliance. Along with this, she favors a Trump-style détente with Russia, which would complicate both US foreign policy with a core ally, but also American national security. Le Pen received “a hefty loan from a Russian bank, and Mr. Macron’s organization has suffered more than 4,000 hacking attacks,” The Economist reported.\n\nLike other right-wing populists in Europe—and our own president—Le Pen trades on insecurities. Horrible terrorist attacks that eluded France’s security system, a chronically sluggish economy and persistently high unemployment—25 percent of French youth are unemployed—have turned France into the most pessimistic of the industrial democracies, a recent survey shows. Such conditions are just right for a candidate fanning anxieties about immigrant populations, global institutions, and free trade.\n\nEven though Donald Trump eschews multinational trade deals in favors of bilateral deals, a Le Pen victory this spring would be bad news for the U.S. And even though Trump is also a disrupter, his America First campaign along with his border tax proposal could alienate a France First nationalist like Le Pen.\n\nRelated: Kremlin Denies French Election Meddling, Macron Camp Renews Charges\n\nMacron is 180° Le Pen’s opposite on all the core questions. He backs the basic institutions supporting the postwar order, and his economics are neoliberal centrist. He pledges to cut the corporate tax rate from 33 percent to 25 percent while giving companies permanent breaks on payroll taxes. He’ll also exempt the corporate sector from some of France’s famously considerable social levies.\n\nMacron’s a fresh face in a field of old-timers and, asserting that France’s middle class has been neglected, promises to make reviving it his priority. But Macron’s not superman. Last week he issued a “manifesto,” and it exposes potential vulnerabilities. His tax cuts are unconvincing, some analysts say, because they’re effectively tied to a European Union pledge to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP.\n\nMacron promises to bring France’s jobless rate down from 10 percent to 7 percent—impressive, except that he gives himself five years to get it done. He’s an austerian who cuts himself some slack, but austerity doesn’t play too well among a lot of voters in France (or anywhere else on the Continent). This election matters far beyond France’s borders, and there are no sure things these days."

While acknowledging that there is significant uncertainty about how CBO will go about modeling every aspect of the GOP plan and determining how the different pieces would interact with one another, Brookings said CBO’s estimates could be even higher than 15 million by the end of the 10-year “scoring window,” but that it is unlikely they will be significantly lower.\n\nPerhaps anticipating a damaging CBO report, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have already cast aspersions on the budget scorekeeper’s past work and the importance of the report expected on Monday. “If you’re looking to the C.B.O. for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nYet the Brookings analysis and guesstimate pinpoint several factors that would contribute to a dramatic drop in coverage. The two biggest are the proposed repeal of the Obamacare mandate requiring uninsured Americans to purchase coverage and a plan to freeze and then phase out expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor in three years.\n\nThe Brookings report said that without the so called individual mandate, many Americans — especially young and healthy people whose participation is vital to the financial success of insurance plans — would drop their insurance coverage. That, in turn, would drive up premiums and spark further coverage losses.\n\nCBO previously estimated that individual market premiums would rise by 20 percent under the GOP approach and that six million people would lose individual market coverage by 2026 as a result. Beyond that, elimination of the individual mandate will reduce by two million the number of people with insurance obtained through their employers. Finally, GOP plans for scaling back Medicaid coverage would reduce by seven million the number of ensured Americans — for a grand total of 15 million.\n\nThe residual effects of the Republicans’ proposal for gradually overhauling Medicaid and converting it into a per capita payment to the states likely would lead to millions of more poor people losing their coverage because of changes in state eligibility requirements and sharp restrictions on funding.\n\nWith so much at stake politically for Trump and the Republicans seeking to fulfill a key campaign vow to repeal and replace Obamacare, Ryan and his troops appear willing to try to ram their bill through the House in the coming weeks. Yet the plan they unveiled on Monday after weeks of secret negotiations has run into a tsunami of opposition from the health care industry, Republican governors, outside conservative groups and a potent mix of conservative and moderate lawmakers in the House and Senate.\n\nTrump has given the plan a strong endorsement and has signaled a willingness to barnstorm across the country to rally support and bend the will of recalcitrant lawmakers. Yet the president has also suggested that he is open to “negotiations,” according to Politico. And in the process he has been sending mixed signals to different factions that are greatly complicating the job of Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in trying to consolidate the party around the bill.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced a portion of the GOP American Health Care Act Thursday on a strict party-line vote, over the strong objections of the Democrats. Earlier in the day, the Ways and Means Committee completed its work on the tax-related portions of the repeal and replacement plan.\n\nNow the action shifts to the House Budget Committee where the pieces will be cobbled together and fine-tuned before Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and the House GOP whip organization attempt to pass it on the floor within the next few weeks.\n\nDemocrats insist that the Republican leadership and Trump are on a fool’s mission in promoting a replacement plan that will never pass the Senate, where the GOP holds a narrow 52-48 margin, even if they manage to get it through the House.\n\nIf the CBO report is in line with the Brookings projections, public anxiety levels are sure to rise and Ryan and others will have to explain why they felt compelled to ram their plan through committee late this week before even seeing CBO’s projections.\n\n“I would think that people would want to know if their constituents would lose their insurance before they vote for this bill today,” said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO)."

    "text": "There is a sharp bifurcation emerging in the Trump cabinet, underlined by the imminent nomination of Jon Huntsman as U.S. ambassador to Russia.\n\nShould Huntsman be nominated and confirmed (and there is no reason to think that won’t happen), the onetime Utah governor, Obama ambassador to China and presidential candidate will join what is emerging as a somewhat unconventional but surprisingly strong defense and foreign policy team.\n\nRelated: The One Way Trump’s Administration Really Is a Fine-Tuned Machine\n\nFormer Marine general Jim Mattis at Defense is widely respected as one of the foremost military leaders of his generation; National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster is, like Mattis, a thinker and strategist known for speaking truth to power; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn’t have a track record in foreign affairs but the former ExxonMobil CEO is a savvy international negotiator; former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, now ambassador to the U.N., is also not long on the usual experience for that role but is already proving herself to be no pushover; and former Iowa governor Terry Branstad has deep ties to Beijing that will likely serve him well as ambassador to China.\n\nIf Branstad needs a sounding board, he’ll have Huntsman, who proved to be a strong voice for America in Beijing (despite the wags who say he doesn’t speak Mandarin as well as advertised).\n\nAnd if Huntsman wants some tips on how to deal with Vladimir Putin and the myriad other problems he will face as our man in Moscow, few people in corporate America were able to deal with the Russians as well as Tillerson.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump frequently said he would hire the best, and that is starting to look half true.\n\nHowever, while the cadre charged with defending the republic and representing the country’s interests abroad has depth and in most cases earned credibility, Trump’s domestic policy crew is mostly a mish-mash of politicians and aspiring politicians without a shred of experience in the departments to which they have been assigned (Rick Perry at Energy and Ben Carson at HUD); pols and aspiring pols with an agenda (Tom Price at Health & Human Services, Scott Pruitt at the EPA and Betsy DeVos at Education); big-time donors (Linda McMahon at the Small Business Administration); and the Wall Street guys who have been handed the keys to the economy (Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross). One outlier is the Homeland Security chief, former General John Kelly.\n\nRelated: How Trump’s Cabinet Picks Are Payback to His Wealthy Pals\n\nIn Huntsman, Trump gets not only an experienced diplomat but a former business executive with significant experience in international trade, having served at Commerce and as deputy trade representative. The president also gets another billionaire; Huntsman’s family business is the hugely successful chemicals company Huntsman Corp.\n\nBut the larger question is: Why is foreign affairs in such seemingly solid hands while the home front is being manned by so many amateurs?\n\nDonald Trump has had business dealing around the globe, including some that are highly suspect. In fact, the current issue of The New Yorker does a deep dive into a questionable Trump Organization project in Azerbaijan. But foreign policy is hardly his forte.\n\nSo if the team he has put in place is a recognition by the president that he knows what he doesn’t know, that’s a good thing."

    "text": "Because of the ban on direct negotiating, Medicare Part D pays on average 73 percent more than Medicaid and 80 percent more than the Department of Veterans Affairs for brand name drugs. If the law were changed and if Medicare paid the same prices as Medicaid or Veterans Affairs, the federal government could save between $15.2 and $16 billion a year.\n\nBut this isn’t an easy win.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday once again says he supports the idea of Medicare negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices for seniors. Allowing Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for 40 million people would require a change in the “Part D” law that was implemented in 2003.\n\nTrump’s commitment brought praise from some Democrats who have urged him to make this a priority to help reduce government spending on prescription drugs. Trump met yesterday with House Democrats Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Peter Welch of Vermont to discuss their proposals.\n\n\n\nRelated: Is the Republican Health Care Bill Headed for a Do-Over?\n\n“The President was clearly very much aware what was going on,” said Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee after the nearly one-hour meeting at the White House. “He understood the issue very well. And he felt it was important that we address this issue head on.”\n\nBut in the face of decades of opposition from the pharmaceutical industry and Trump’s daunting challenge in lining up support for the House GOP’s plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, action to strengthen Medicare’s negotiating hand may be a bridge too far this year.\n\n“My guess would be that this is something they’re going to shelve this year,” said Michael Cannon, a health care policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute. “They’re asking a lot of the rank and file just to go along with this health care bill, and that idea – for better or worse –is one that does not pay well among the rank and file Republicans in the House and Senate.”\n\nThe White House issued a statement after the meeting with Cummings and Welch saying the president wanted to work together in a bipartisan fashion to make prescription drugs more affordable.\n\nRelated: Trump Says He Is Working To Bring Down Drug Prices\n\nCalls for drug price containment to ease the government’s health care costs ricocheted throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed measures to rein in drug costs, including importing cheaper drugs and empowering Medicare officials to drive a harder bargain with drug companies.\n\nMedicaid drug prices are set by law at the lower end of a discounted price or the lowest price anyone can negotiate. Veterans Affairs also negotiates prices, receives mandatory rebates, and maintains a national drug formulary that encourages drug companies to compete more aggressively.\n\nYet presidents dating back to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush struggled to enlist support in Congress to grant Medicare the same bargaining power that other federal health care programs and departments enjoy. And it’s no wonder since the drug industry donated $244 million to Congress in 2016 and had the dubious distinction of being the number one lobby industry in America.\n\nBefore the government could even begin to negotiate drug prices under Medicare Part D, government policy makers would first have to define precisely what negotiations would entail, according to an analysis by Health Affairs.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThat would mean determining precisely which of the many drugs would be subject to negotiation and deciding whether they should include brand drugs that have competing generic versions. HHS would also have to create a metric for year-over-year drug price comparisons. And finally, it would have to create a formulary or detailed list of drugs covered by Medicare that sets a ceiling for drug prices.\n\nFormularies essentially are designed to give certain drugs “preferred status” over other comparable drugs. Such a listing would be a potent tool for HHS in extracting price reductions because it would force major drug manufacturers to offer price concessions or risk losing out on an important share of the Medicare market.\n\nDrug manufacturers and their well-paid lobbyists argued that Medicare was still able to obtain deep discounts and rebates from drug manufacturers for seniors, while middle-man drug distributors such as CVS Health and SilverScript extracted additional price reductions from drug companies.\n\nThe legislative ban on government price bargaining, even as prescription drug costs steadily climbed over the years, was justified by the industry and other supporters on free market grounds. Also, strengthening Medicare’s bargaining hand would constitute a dangerous move towards government price controls, they argued, while drug companies would lose billions of dollars in revenues that could have gone for research and innovation.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n“Republicans say they want limited government and they don’t like price controls,” Cannon said. “So they’ve found it easier to burnish their limited government bona fides and appeal to that element of their base by opposing big government attempts to ration care for seniors by imposing price controls on prescription drugs.”\n\nBut Trump and an array of Democratic and Republican lawmakers aren’t buying that line and insist that much can be done to strengthen the government’s hand in containing drug prices for the 40 million or so seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D.\n\n“It simply makes no sense for Medicare to buy wholesale and pay retail prices,” Welch, the Vermont Democrat, said in a statement. “As a businessman, President Trump understands that. I hope he helps us enact our legislation to provide urgently needed relief to consumers and taxpayers.”"

    "text": "Even as the Republicans’ bill to replace the Affordable Care Act cleared its first committee in the House of Representatives and gained the support of the Trump administration, its chances of passing either chamber of Congress, and particularly the Senate, looked increasingly slim.\n\nBoth the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees worked through the night on the American Health Care Act. Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) announced after 4 a.m. on Thursday that his committee had finally wrapped up its work.\n\nRelated: Trump Uses His ‘Discredit Tactic’ on CBO to Hedge Against Negative Report\n\n“Ways and Means Republicans just passed legislation that will help Americans finally have access to affordable health care,” he said in a statement. “We voted repeatedly to end Obamacare’s crushing taxes and mandates and ensure patients have more power over their own health care.”\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee, which convened at 10:30 Wednesday morning to consider the bill, passed the legislation after 27 hours of deliberation.\n\nBut the work seemed to many to be almost certainly in vain. Within the House itself, the bill is facing united opposition from Democrats, who say it will deprive millions of people of access to affordable health care. That wouldn’t normally be a problem, given that the Republicans have a majority in the House.\n\nHowever, many of the most conservative Republicans in the body have come out against it as well, insisting that a system of tax credits that the bill would use to replace the ACA’s complicated set of subsidies, amounts to a new entitlement program.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan – and 3 Big Losers\n\nOthers are incensed at House leadership for rushing to pass the bill before the Congressional Budget Office has the time to provide an official budget score, which would details both the costs of the new plan and an estimate of the impact it would have on the number of Americans who have health insurance.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House took the extraordinary step of preemptively attacking the credibility of the CBO, which is widely respected in Washington for delivering non-partisan analysis of legislation. “If you’re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place,” White House Press Secretary Spicer said during a briefing.\n\nAnd if the AHCA’s chances in the House look iffy, it looks doomed in the Senate. The bill would be packaged as part of a budget reconciliation package, and therefore would not be subject to the filibuster and could be passed with a bare majority. But the GOP has only a 52-48 majority in the chamber, meaning that if they lost two votes they would need Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie (as both Al Gore did in a 1993 budget reconciliation bill and Dick Cheney did in 2003.) If they were to lose three senators, the bill would die in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is that so far more than half a dozen Republicans have expressed opposition to the bill. Four were concerned about the expectation that it would throw millions of people off of Medicaid rolls, which were greatly expanded under the ACA. Others, like Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, said the bill, which retains some features of Obamacare, did not live up to conservatives’ promises to replace the law.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nOn Thursday morning, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton took his colleagues in the House to task on Twitter, blasting them for ramming through a piece of legislation in the same way that Republicans criticized Democrats for passing the ACA in 2010.\n\n“House health-care bill can't pass Senate w/o major changes,” he wrote. “To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast. GOP shouldn't act like Dems did in O'care. No excuse to release bill Mon night, start voting Wed. With no budget estimate! What matters in long run is better, more affordable healthcare for Americans, NOT House leaders' arbitrary legislative calendar.”\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, has thrown its weight behind the bill. President Trump, after earlier in the week warning Congressional Republicans that they would face an electoral “bloodbath” if they failed to pass the bill, called conservative House leaders into the Oval Office and reportedly berated them for “helping the other side” by calling the bill “Obamacare lite.”\n\nDuring the meeting, CNN reported, White House staff expressed openness to moving up the proposed changes to Medicaid to 2018 rather than 2020, as the bill currently would. While that might bring along a few House conservatives, though, it would likely only harden opposition to the bill in the Senate.\n\nHe promised to hold football stadium rallies in states where Democrats are facing tough reelection battles, and reportedly said that his fallback position, should the bill not survive, would be to stop supporting the ACA, let the insurance markets collapse, and try to force the blame on Democrats."

    "text": "By launching an attack on the credibility of Washington’s premier budget scorekeeper, the Trump administration signaled on Wednesday that it expects to receive a highly negative report next week from the Congressional Budget Office on the cost and likely impact of the House GOP’s plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe CBO is considered the gold standard for non-partisan budget analysis and economic forecasting in the complex and politically charged world of budget politics. It’s track record over the years for forecasting government spending, assessing the likely impact of major programs and budget deals, and predicting the deficit has been solid, if far from perfect.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan – and 3 Big Losers\n\n“CBO has I think done a very credible job, but the job itself is very difficult, and often the outcome and the forecasts are very different,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director between 2003 and 2005 and a Republican policy adviser. “Yes, it is easy to predict the future. No, it is not easy to be right. That’s their job.”\n\nYet White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer yesterday blasted the agency for being “way off last time” in its cost estimates of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. He stressed that the CBO’s report next week – which will likely project rising deficits and the loss of health insurance coverage for millions of Americans under the GOP plan -- should not be taken as the final word.\n\n“If you’re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place,” Spicer said during a White House press briefing.\n\nIn a further slap, Spicer said the White House intends to issue its own estimate of the impact of the proposed GOP American Health Care Act. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former Tea Party conservative House member who is pushing for passage of the bill, will oversee the findings. Earlier in the day, Mulvaney told MSNBC that he wasn't worried about what the CBO report would show and that \"the only question about CBO: Is it going to be really good, or is it going to be great when the numbers finally come out.\"\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nSpicer’s comments touched off an uproar among economists and budget analysts, who complained that the Trump White House was once again attempting to discredit an important institution that disagreed with him, just as he has done in going after the intelligence community and the judiciary.\n\n“I think this is clearly an attempt to dismiss in advance the likely insurance coverage estimates that CBO is going to produce showing that the large share of those losing coverage due to repeal would likely become uninsured compared to current law under the House plan,” said Edwin Park, a health policy expert with the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nBill Hoagland, the senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Republican Senate Budget Committee staff director, said he was alarmed that Trump and his aides would attempt to undermine confidence in the CBO and threaten to throw the budget process into disarray.\n\n“The biggest loser in all of this is a loss of trust in institutions that Trump has created,” Hoagland said in an interview. “This would be very, very damaging to the congressional budget process to undercut CBO.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nA Democratic-controlled Congress created the CBO in 1974 as the ultimate arbiter of the impact of spending on the budget and deficit, and the leadership chose Alice Rivlin as the agency’s first director. Hoagland got one of his first jobs in Washington as an aide to Rivlin. Since then, he has served as a staunch defender of the agency under both Democratic and Republican directors.\n\nOver the years, the agency has had many run-ins with the White House and the majority party in Congress over the cost and impact of huge new programs. Those disputes have ranged from the financial implications of President George W. Bush’s Medicare prescription-drug program to the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the Clinton administration’s failed national health care initiative to the passage of the Affordable Care Act during the first term of the Obama administration.\n\nOne storied conflict pitted then- CBO director Robert D. Reischauer, a prominent Democrat, against Clinton and his wife, Hillary over cost estimates of their proposed government-sponsored health care plan in 1994. Reischauer’s analysts added billions of dollars to the estimated long-term cost of the proposed program – a finding that opponents seized upon to help block passage.\n\nThis time it’s CBO director Keith Hall, a conservative who was handpicked for the job by the House and Senate Republican leaders, who is coming under fire from a Republican president who worries that he may provide opponents with more ammunition to block the GOP health plan. Hall, a former commissioner of the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, succeeded Democrat Douglas Elmendorf as CBO director in April 2015.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nDeborah Kilroe, a spokesman for Hall, declined to respond to Spicer’s attack.\n\nSpicer didn’t say precisely which forecasts he had in mind in going after the CBO, although no one questions that the agency’s initial estimates of Obamacare’s long-term cost and enrollment figures were off.\n\nCBO’s original analysis of the 2010 Affordable Care Act provided long-term projections of enrollment that proved to be overly optimistic, although subsequent events including the 2015 Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the law resulted in fewer states enrolling people in an expanded Medicaid program than originally predicted.\n\nMoreover, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated when the law was passed in March 2010 that it would cost $214 billion a year by 2019, although today the estimate is down to $148 billion. CBO said last week that “technical revisions” and updates to agency economic projections account for part of the downward revision in cost.\n\n“CBO has always been criticized by lots of people, but in the end, they work for the Congress, and that’s the criticism they should pay attention to,” said Holtz-Eakin. “Their credibility wasn’t built by having press secretaries like or dislike them. It’s the quality of work they do. They’ll be fine.”"

    "text": "It didn’t take long for Republican leadership on Capitol Hill to produce an answer to seven years of pledges to repeal Obamacare. It also didn’t take long for Donald Trump to throw his considerable political weight behind it as an answer to his promise to protect Americans through the process. It might take a long time to sort out whether the American Health Care Act (AHCA) actually fulfills either of those promises, or whether conservatives have enough patience and trust to see whether the AHCA is just the start of a longer process to fully uproot the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nSo far, the reviews of the AHCA on the Right have been somewhat short of enthusiastic. In fact, four influential conservative and libertarian groups announced their opposition to the AHCA: the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and the Club For Growth all recommend that House Republicans vote no on AHCA and force leadership to start over.\n\nRelated: 3 Big Winners in the GOP Health Care Plan – and 3 Big Losers\n\n“Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare,” Heritage announced, “congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health care system that empowers patients and doctors.”\n\nThe bill didn’t get a much more favorable assessment from the Republican Study Committee (RSC), an influential policy group within the House Republican caucus. In a memo distributed on Monday after the plan was released, the committee included tax credits among its “major concerns,” concluding that the AHCA “is, in principle, Obamacare” for its tax-credit subsidies for purchasing health insurance. The replacement for the ACA still “is fundamentally grounded on the idea that the federal government should fund insurance purchases.” Furthermore, the tax credits threaten to add up to dramatic costs, making the AHCA “a Republican plan that deficit spends at the same rate as the current plan.”\n\nThe decision to keep the controversial Medicaid expansion in place drew even more ire from the RSC, criticism that was echoed among House conservatives. The bill plans to keep the Obamacare expansion with its 90 percent federal share of payment in place for three years, and then to phase it out over the next five years at the normal 57 percent reimbursement from Washington.\n\nThat assumes that a future Congress would have the political will to maintain that phase-out, which the RSC called “doubtful” for the same reasons that Republican leadership avoided phasing it out immediately. “The major cause for the delay is to avoid the political consequences and pain of unwinding expansion, especially in Republican-held states with upcoming gubernatorial contests,” their analysis accuses, adding that “it is unlikely that any future Congress will have a stronger political will in terms of reforming Obamacare than the sitting Congress[.]”\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap: GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nIn so many words, the RSC accused Republicans and the Trump White House of surrendering on Obamacare repeal. But have they surrendered, or merely taken the first steps through a labyrinth of obstacles?\n\nOne challenge facing Republican leadership is the reconciliation process in the Senate. Harry Reid famously used that budgetary exception to pass Obamacare on a majority vote, eliminating the use of the filibuster. However, only legislation with a specific impact on the federal budget can cite reconciliation to avoid the filibuster. That limits what the repeal bill can do and still be passed on a majority vote. The AHCA necessarily only addresses those portions which qualify under Senate rules.\n\nThe next complicating factor is Donald Trump’s promise to ensure that Americans don’t get abandoned in the process. That’s almost certainly why the AHCA does not eliminate the Medicaid expansion immediately, as House conservatives had hoped, and why this plan continues the practice of subsidies for health-insurance purchases. The need to extend both of those for the next few years stems from the difficulty of getting a full replacement program through the Senate; Republicans clearly hope to have a filibuster-proof majority after the 2018 midterms, but need to leave some measures in place before then.\n\nRelated: A Test for the Dealmaker: Selling the Controversial GOP Health Care Plan\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily make the AHCA the best bill that can pass under these circumstances, but it does explain why Republican leadership may have refrained from producing a final, full-scale repeal-and-replace bill in favor of a transition plan. And the White House has responded to criticism of the plan by offering to negotiate amendments through the legislative process. Tom Price, former chair of the RSC and now Secretary of Health and Human Services, made that explicit on Tuesday.\n\n“This is a work in progress,” Price told The New York Times’ Glenn Thrush, adding that they plan to work through the “legislative process.” Likewise, Trump later tweeted that the bill was “out for review and negotiation,” even while warning Republicans on Capitol Hill in a private meeting that the GOP will face an electoral “bloodbath” if they don’t take some action to roll back Obamacare soon.\n\nSo far, Trump’s sales pitch has not produced too much success, but it’s still early in the process. To get conservatives and moderates on board, Trump and the rest of the Republican leadership will need to commit to a free-market end solution when they have more political weight to replace the rest of the ACA while pointing to these efforts as just a transitional effort that protects voters in the meantime. If this really does represent the end game of the Obamacare repeal and replace effort, though, then not even Trump’s Art of the Deal prowess can salvage this sale."

    "text": "President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) are promoting the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act in the face of mounting opposition.\n\nThe plan -- which scraps most of the mandates and tax subsidies in the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replaces them with a new system of tax credits based on age and income -- has drawn sharp fire from conservatives who have dismissed it as “Obamacare lite” and from Democrats who warn that it would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe fate of the plan is highly uncertain at this point. Members of the Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Group and other conservative factions could block passage in the House unless Trump and Ryan can somehow bring them to heel. And an alliance of arch-conservative and moderate Republicans in the Senate could torpedo the legislation if it makes it that far.\n\nIf the Republicans succeed in repealing and replacing a major federal health care program -- for the first time in history -- there will be numerous winners and losers in their wake. Paul B. Ginsburg, director of the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said that generally speaking, wealthier, healthier and younger people would do well under the House GOP plan, while older, poorer and sicker people would be worse off.\n\n“I think the people that lose the most are low income people in general, but particularly those who are older but under 65” and not eligible for Medicare, he said in an interview. “And I think that health care providers will have significant losses that line up with the losses of coverage by the low income people.”\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Won’t Be Cheap, GOP Plan Could Cost $700 Billion\n\nHere are the likely winners and losers in the Republican’s current health care plan:\n\n1. Winners: Upper-middle income Americans.\n\nMillions of people who made too much money to qualify for tax credit subsidies under Obamacare would qualify under the GOP plan, which is based more on age than income. Tax credits under the GOP plan would start at $2,000 a year for a person under the age of 30 and rise to a maximum of $4,000 for a person 60 or older. The benefit begins to phase out for individuals with incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000.\n\nMore importantly, middle and upper income Americans would enjoy major tax relief because the Republicans intend to repeal Obamacare taxes that raised the rate on the federal payroll tax and on capital gains.\n\n2. Winners: Young adults.\n\nThe GOP plan would be a boon for the nation’s Millennials, who no longer would be subject to the mandate that they purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. They would be free to either purchase cheaper insurance policies offering less coverage or buy nothing at all until they need it.\n\nThe individual mandate was necessary under Obamacare to bring younger, healthier people into the insurance pool to help offset the cost of older, sicker people. And insurance companies had no choice but to charge younger people rates fairly close to what they were charging older people.\n\nBut with the GOP plan, insurers could boost their premiums on older Americans to as much as five times what they charge younger people – a move that could have the effect of bringing down Millennials’ premiums and copayments.\n\n3. Winners: States that shunned expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nA 2015 Supreme Court ruling allowed states to decide whether to take advantage of expanded Medicaid for the poor under Obamacare, and many red states rejected the offer to signal their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. But lawmakers from those states have long complained of the inequity of the federal government picking up 90 percent of the cost of the additional coverage in the states that accepted the plan while the other states received nothing.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nFor those 19 states that did not expand Medicaid, the new House GOP bill would provide $10 billion spread over five years. States could use that money to subsidize hospitals and other providers that treat poor patients.\n\n1. Losers: The insurance industry.\n\nInsurers would celebrate the repeal of some of the Obamacare taxes that have added to their operating costs. That includes a two to three percent tax on health care premiums. But they would continue to be saddled with mandates and rules that have constrained their profitability.\n\nThose mandates include a requirement that they insure people with pre-existing conditions; a ban on one-year or lifetime limits on benefits; a requirement that their plans cover 10 essential categories of benefits; and a cap on how much customers can be asked to pay for coverage through deductibles and co-payments. Moreover, with fewer people able to purchase health insurance with diminished tax credit supports under the GOP plan, the individual health care market will become more unstable, likely resulting in more major insurers pulling out of the market.\n\n2. Losers: Low income Americans.\n\nThe existing law is designed to help low income people the most, by limiting the availability of tax credit subsidies to people with income levels between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty levels. That means that only Americans with annual incomes of between $12,070 and $48,284 a year currently qualify for Obamacare tax subsidies. And their premiums for more modest health insurance policies and out of pocket costs are capped at roughly 10 percent of their annual income, to make the coverage affordable.\n\nRelated: GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nAll of that would change under the House GOP law, because the tax credits would no longer be tied to income but to a person’s age, with the tax credits highest for older Americans, even those with substantial incomes.\n\nThe proposed legislation would effectively slash subsidies that currently help many low-income people buy health insurance. And it would not take into account that health insurance costs vary by region of the country. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation calculation, a typical 60-year-old person in Nebraska who currently qualifies for a $18,470 subsidy to help purchase insurance coverage, with additional subsidies to cover out of pocket costs, would receive a subsidy of only $4,000, with no additional assistance, under the GOP plan.\n\n3. Losers: Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nCurrently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have signed up for an expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare in which the federal government pays about 90 percent of the bill for health care coverage to roughly 10 million low income adults who previously didn’t qualify for the program. Ryan and other conservatives have long attempted to rescind the program and cut back on Medicaid spending more generally, in the face of resistance from some Republican as well as Democratic governors.\n\nThe GOP replacement plan would eliminate Medicaid expansion by 2020. States could continue to provide coverage if they choose, but they would receive far less federal assistance to do so. Moreover, Congress would also convert traditional Medicaid into fixed per capita payment to the states. Those steps taken together would almost certainly slash enrollments in Medicaid, which currently total about 70 million, and reduce the benefit level over time.\n\nEdwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, recently issued an updated analysis of the plan’s proposed changes to the Medicaid program and determined that the American Health Care Act would cost states $370 billion in federal aid over ten years."

    "text": "In an effort to calm the increasingly dangerous standoff between North Korea on one side and the U.S. and South Korea on the other, China on Wednesday proposed a solution aimed at a long-term reduction in tensions: Pyongyang puts its nuclear and missile programs on ice, while Washington and Seoul halt joint military exercises.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nChina appears to be a peacemaker, but it may be running scared to the bargaining table for two reasons. While the repressive dynasty that has ruled North Korea since the 1950s could not have remained in power without Beijing’s support, the current leader, Kim Jong-un, is acting more unstable than his predecessor and must be reined in before he ignites a new war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe second reason is an acronym: THAAD.\n\nThat stands for Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense – the $1.6 billion-per-unit, anti-missile defense system that the U.S. began positioning in South Korea this week after North Korea fired four missiles on Monday said to be aimed at American bases in Japan. The missiles were described by South Korean military and intelligence officials as a version of the Scud surface-to-surface ballistic missile. All four missiles fell into the Sea of Japan, but some came as close as 190 miles from the coast, according to Reuters.\n\nOne THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 49 interceptors and AN/TPY-2 radar, according to DefenseNews. Raytheon, which builds the radar system for the unit in conjunction with Lockheed Martin, says it has “a record of flawless performance against all classes of ballistic missiles.”\n\nBut the radar’s accuracy and detection may be what China fears as much as the disruption of the balance of forces on the peninsula. The radar’s coverage could extend beyond North Korea and into China. In an article written last year, when THAAD deployment was being considered, DefenseNews quoted a Chinese defense analyst as saying: “THAAD deployment could bring a severe shock to the security status quo that exists between China and the U.S., as well as with Russia.”\n\nRelated: US Navy Sends a Powerful Message to Beijing in the South China Sea\n\nSouth Korea has been pushing for deployment of THAAD systems because its current missile defenses allow for interception at an altitude of only 9.3 miles. THAAD would increase that range to between 24.8 and 93.2 miles, and with both systems in place, there would be a double deterrent, the Seoul-based think tank Korea Defense & Security Forum told DefenseNews.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday said that Beijing’s intention was “to flash the red light and apply brakes” to the situation, The New York Times reported. But as the Times pointed out, a 2015 proposal by North Korea for a moratorium on nuclear tests in exchange for a cancellation of joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which Pyongyang has called a prelude for invasion, went nowhere.\n\nBeijing’s concern about Kim Jong-un may be more heightened than ever after the assassination of his estranged half-brother Kim Jong-nam in Kuala Lumpur and the execution of five of the North Korean leader’s top security officials with anti-aircraft guns because they “enraged” him with false reports.\n\nMalaysian officials have implicated North Korean agents in the bizarre killing of Kim Jong-nam; Malaysian citizens are not being allowed to leave North Korea; North Koreans are not being allowed to leave Malaysia; and a video was posted on Tuesday in which a young man claiming to be Kim Jong-nam’s son says he and his mother and sister are in hiding.\n\nRelated: North Korea’s Missile Test Leaves Trump with Three Options\n\nThe Times quoted Foreign Minister Wang as saying of the confrontation between North Korea and the U.S.-South Korea: “The two sides are like two accelerating trains coming toward each other, and neither side is willing to give way. The question is: Are both sides really prepared for a head-on collision?”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/08/Big-Winner-Trump-s-Immigration-Crackdown-Private-Prisons",
    "text": "The new Trump administration has been met with a wave of business optimism. But few are quite as enthusiastic as the private prison industry.\n\nTwo of the biggest players in the business, GEO Group and CoreCivic — the latter formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) — saw their stock jump right after Trump's election. As of late February, GEO's stock was up 98 percent and CoreCivic's was up 137 percent. The industry is even opening at least two new for-profit centers in Georgia and Texas.\n\nRelated: To Build His Wall, Trump Would Cut FEMA, Airline and Waterway Security\n\nThe reasons for the champagne popping are pretty straightforward.\n\nAcross the country, over 2.2 million people are held in federal, state, and local prison facilities. Six percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners are held in private prisons run by companies like GEO and CoreCivic. The federal government's share of the private prison population amounts to 21,000 inmates, spread across 12 contracts. And back in August of 2016, President Obama's Justice Department sent out a memorandum instructing its officials not to renew any of those contracts.\n\nGiven that the state and local prison population is far larger, this certainly wasn't a death blow to the industry. But it hurt their bottom line.\n\nThen in late February, the Trump administration scrapped that decision. Trump's recently-installed attorney general, Jeff Sessions, sent the Bureau of Prisons his own memo stating the Obama-era order \"impaired the bureau’s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.\"\n\nRelated: Here’s What Trump’s ‘Merit-Based’ Immigration System Would Look Like\n\n\"Therefore, I direct the bureau to return to its previous approach,\" he concluded.\n\nThe Trump administration may want to slash the budgets of the State Department and the EPA, but it also wants to ramp up spending on things like the military and law and order. So the private prison industry is breathing a sigh of relief that the federal money hose will stay on.\n\nThe thing is, the profit motive introduces all sorts of perverse incentives into the job of running prisons: The less a company spends per inmate on things like health care, guards, upkeep, etc., the more it can pocket as profit from the contract fees the government pays the industry. As a result, private prisons are generally more dangerous than public ones, and the industry abounds with accusations of wrongful deaths and mistreatment of prisoners. The industry even uses its inmate population as a source of ultra-cheap labor from which it can further profit.\n\nThis is precisely why Obama's Justice Department made the decision it did. A review it conducted last year concluded that private prisons \"simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources\" and \"do not maintain the same level of safety and security\" as the federal government's own facilities.\n\nThis isn't all.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump’s New Immigration Orders\n\nThe federal government relies on the private prison industry to detain immigrants as well. For all the talk from Republicans about how Democrats are too nice to undocumented immigrants, the Obama administration actually oversaw a record-breaking 2.5 million deportations from 2009 to 2015. By November 2016, the number of immigrants held in some sort of detention facility rose was an eye-popping 41,000. And fully 65 percent of those held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in private prisons.\n\nThese facilities raise the same humanitarian concerns. In 2014, for example, GEO Group was sued by nine former immigrant detainees, alleging they were forced to work for $1 a day. Just last week, that suit was granted class-action status, meaning as many as 60,000 immigrants could now be represented by it.\n\nThe private prisons used by ICE fall under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and thus weren't subject to the memo from Obama's Justice Department. But DHS ran its own inquiry into its use of private prisons and came to a fatalistic conclusion: Between fiscal constraints and the number of people moving through the system, immigration enforcement would have to keep relying on private prisons.\n\nNow, the memos and executive orders from the Trump administration suggest it wants to double ICE's detention capacity to 80,000 per day, in keeping with its renewed crackdown. As DHS's previous investigation suggests, much of that capacity will have to come from expanding private contracts. \"Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded,\" Carl Takei, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, told Mother Jones.\n\nWhat makes this business arrangement especially perverse is that the private prison industry has a profit incentive to encourage the federal government to take a particular approach to law and immigration enforcement. The more brutal and draconian the federal government is about detaining undocumented immigrants, the larger the prison population becomes and the more prison companies profit. The same is true for the harshness of our sentencing laws, the scale of the drug war, and other policies. Conversely, CoreCivic observed in a 2005 report that when the government is more lenient and more willing to decriminalize activities \"demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, GEO and CoreCivic are both enthusiastic donors to the GOP. And now the Trump White House is resuscitating federal contracts with private prisons, aiming to massively ramp up immigration detentions, and even taking an unfriendly stance towards marijuana decriminalization.\n\n\"When coupled with the above average rate of crossings along the southwest border, these executive orders appear likely to significantly increase the need for safe, humane, and appropriate detention bed capacity that we have available,\" Damon Hininger, the president and CEO of CoreCivic, recently said.\n\nOf course, the \"safe, humane and appropriate\" part is subject to interpretation.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Week.

    "text": "President Trump’s promise to construct a wall on the border with Mexico has taken on such overarching importance in the White House that the administration is reportedly considering drastic budget cuts to agencies with responsibility for major elements of national security, including the Transportation Security Agency and the Coast Guard.\n\nFirst reported by Politico and later confirmed by multiple other outlets, the White House Office of Management and Budget is weighing a plan to lop off 14 percent of the Coast Guard’s budget for 2017, cutting its spending authority from $9.1 billion to $7.8 billion. The TSA would face a similar haircut, losing 11 percent of its budget, from $5.2 billion to $4.6 billion.\n\nRelated: How the New Trump Travel Ban Could Hurt the US Economy\n\nCuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency are also being considered, which would reduce its budget by 11 percent, from a little over $4 billion to $3.6 billion.\n\nTaken in combination with the Trump administration’s promise to quickly and dramatically increase the number of agents working for the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Control, the proposed cuts represent what appears to be a dramatic realignment of priorities in border security, with money and manpower being directed to the southern border at the expense of virtually all other points of entry to the country.\n\nThe TSA, best known to airline travelers as the employer of uniformed officers inspecting bags and delivering the occasional intrusive pat-down at airports, is considered a key element on the front lines of the national security state, charged with protecting travelers from physical attacks.\n\nThe proposal would eliminate TSA training programs, and funding for armed patrols of airports, train stations and other transportation hubs. It would also eliminate grants to local law enforcement agencies to increase patrols around airports.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Trump’s ‘Merit-Based’ Immigration System Would Look Like\n\nThe Coast Guard’s role is less obvious to most citizens but is also a key cog in the national security machine. Defunding it in the name of border security is even more ironic, if possible, than taking money from the TSA.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump railed against the flow of both undocumented immigrants and drugs into the country. The Coast Guard plays an important role in combating both. Its fleet of cutters, airplanes and helicopters runs drug interdiction missions in the coastal waters of the United States and intercepts boatloads of would-be undocumented immigrants in the waters off Florida.\n\n“OMB has always treated the Coast Guard like a little piggy bank that they can go after whenever they need money for anything else,” California Congressman Duncan Hunter, the Republican in charge of the subcommittee with oversight authority over the agency told The Washington Post. “If the president is serious about getting after the cartels and getting after drug networks, this makes no sense.”\n\nRelated: As AG, Sessions Could Radically Influence Immigration Enforcement\n\nFEMA’s role, while not related to national security per se, is well-known to the public from the news coverage of hurricanes, tornados and other natural disasters, where it assists with rescue, recovery and rebuilding.\n\nWhat remains unclear is whether Trump’s proposed changes to the way the nation spends money on national security and border enforcement reflects the considered judgment of experts that it will actually make the nation safer, or simply the determination of the president to keep a campaign promise, regardless of the cost."

    "text": "A new report by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation highlights the Republicans' growing challenge to find a way to finance their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GOP and its allies have been unable to agree on a way to replace the hundreds of billions of dollars generated by Obamacare’s tax increases on wealthy Americans and the health care industry. For now, they have created a placeholder in their plan while temporarily maintaining many of the Obamacare tax increases for one year.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nOn Tuesday, economists at the Joint Committee on Taxation released their estimates of the cost of fully repealing the ACA's taxes. The report showed the Treasury would lose nearly $600 billion in tax revenue through 2026 – and likely close to $700 billion through 2027.\n\nThe dozen or so Obamacare taxes that were targeted by the Republicans for repeal include a 3.8 percent investment income tax, a health insurer tax, a 0.9 percent payroll tax, a medical expense deduction and a prescription drug industry tax. The CBO has estimated that the existing Obamacare taxes would generate about $1.1 trillion in revenues between 2016 and 2025 without any changes.\n\nThe House GOP Obamacare replacement plan unveiled by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Monday includes an alternative package of costly tax credit subsidies for millions of Americans, tax-exempt health savings accounts, and a commitment to continue expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor in 31 states and the District of Columbia through early 2020.\n\nAt one time the plan was going to be largely financed by capping a highly generous federal tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance – a move that potentially could raise $100 billion a year.\n\nRelated: GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nThe health insurance tax exemption – by far the biggest loophole in the federal tax code – costs the Treasury roughly $260 billion a year by not taxing employer-provided health benefits for employees. Many economists and fiscal conservatives have argued for years that Congress should eliminate the tax break or at least cap its benefit so that high-end or “Cadillac” health insurance policies don’t escape taxation.\n\nBut when employers, labor leaders, national business organizations and conservative groups all raised a fuss, House GOP leaders pulled back and postponed the effective date of the change until 2025.\n\nBy delaying the effective date, the Republicans could claim credit for the revenue savings in a budget resolution without hitting employers and employees with higher taxes on the health care benefits, according to Michael Cannon, the director of health policy at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\n“It’s clearly in there just to cook the books and make the numbers look better than they are,” Cannon said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nNow, however, there is a glaring hole of $600 billion to $700 billion in the House GOP plan, which has drawn sharp attacks not just from Democrats opposed to repealing the health care law, but also from many Republican lawmakers.\n\nBut figuring out a way to plug a $600 billion hole in their replacement legislation is only part of the problem. The estimates of JCT, a non-partisan research arm of Congress, do not include the cost of repealing the individual and employer mandates or the cost of the replacement tax credits in the House legislation.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nMembers of the influential House Freedom Caucus and the House Liberty Caucus came out against the plan Tuesday, and they have the strength to derail the bill. They are demanding a complete repeal of Obamacare, particularly the mandates and taxes. Also on Tuesday, enough U.S. senators came out against the proposal to put it in danger of failing in that body as well.\n\nMeanwhile, House Leadership and the White House were mounting a full court press to back the law. President Trump tweeted favorably about it on Tuesday morning, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was brought into the White House briefing room to talk to reporters about it.\n\nSo far, it doesn't seem to be working.\n\n“Certainly, fiscally there is a problem for the Republicans,” said Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute, “and that’s leaving aside the politics.”\n\nRelated: Top Trump Advisers Differ Over Whether Medicare Reform Is ‘On the Table’\n\nAntos said the House Republicans “put themselves in a box” by calling for the repeal of all the Obamacare taxes as well as all other provisions of the law in a budget resolution that the GOP-controlled Congress sent to President Barack Obama in January 2016.\n\nObama vetoed that repeal legislation. However, the Republicans by then were committed to ridding the country of all those taxes when they finally gained control of the White House. Now they must deliver on that promise or face political consequences from their political base.\n\n“So they do have a problem in that regard,” Antos said.\n\nThe Fiscal Times’ Rob Garver contributed to this report."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/08/Test-Dealmaker-Selling-Controversial-GOP-Health-Care-Plan",
    "text": "Republicans are squabbling over healthcare. Again. But the repeal and replacement of Obamacare will go forward. Why? Because this has been the signature issue of every GOP campaign for over six years; they cannot afford to fail. Also, since the Affordable Care Act is neither affordable nor sustainable and is harming the country, President Trump wants the GOP plan to succeed.\n\nThe coming fight over the new American Healthcare Act will test Trump’s resolve and clout. Unlike Obama, who rarely inserted himself into Congressional tussles, Trump appears eager to engage. The night before the program was revealed, he dined with Budget Director Mulvaney and HHS Director Tom Price, talking strategy and messaging. He has also hosted a series of get-togethers with Congressional leaders, and yesterday the president met with the deputy whip team from the House – the folks who will be counting noses. When needed, Trump will gladly strong-arm Republicans in the House and Senate to corral their votes.\n\nHe’s good at that; that’s the art of the deal. And no deal has even been more critical to Mr. Trump’s success.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe bill laid out by House Republicans is predictably causing feinting fits among liberals; one columnist wrote it would “destroy the ability of millions of Americans to access any healthcare worth the name.” Voices on the left object to the possible defunding of Planned Parenthood, the tax breaks (which would accrue to those with income – i.e. the “wealthy”), the reversion of more authority to the states (which, for reasons unknown are meant to be less generous to residents than the federal government), and the removal of Obamacare’s mandate-enforcing taxes, which would lead to fewer young and sick people buying insurance. Of course, that is already happening because the fees imposed under Obamacare were insufficient to make people sign up. That’s why Aetna’s CEO has said that the program is in a “death spiral.”\n\nThere may be some accommodation to liberals; for instance, there are signs the Trump White House is reluctant to withdraw funding to Planned Parenthood. Also, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings has announced he will meet with Trump to explore ways to bring down prescription drug costs. But mainly, the negotiations will be with Republicans who have the votes to push the new health plan through if they are united.\n\nTea Party stalwarts fret about creating new entitlements or budget-busting tax credits and call the bill “Obamacare light.” As ever, the far right is willing to make perfect the enemy of the good.\n\nBut many of those critics represent states and districts where Donald Trump won convincingly. As he rolls out policies, they will defy him at their political peril. The most recent average of polls shows Trump’s approval ratings at a negative spread (-9); that’s not great, but it sure beats the -42 percent polling for Congress.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\nRand Paul, for instance, raised objections to the House plan even before he saw it, making the case that it was concocted “in secret;” the Kentucky senator engineered a made-for-TV moment by “hunting” for the legislation last week before it was released to the public. It is hard to take Rand’s complaints seriously. Surely he knew that the minute Democrats had a look at the proposed legislation, they would rip it to shreds.\n\nTrump carried Kentucky by 62.5 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 32.7 percent; Mitt Romney had carried the state by only 20 points. Rand Paul won reelection 57.3 percent to 42.7 percent. Trump carried all counties but two; Paul lost seven counties and barely won a handful of others. Paul doesn’t face reelection for six years, but bucking Trump could cost him support and dim his prospects for another presidential run down the road.\n\nFour GOP senators have complained in a letter that the House proposal “does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion programs or the necessary flexibility for states.\" Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (West Virginia), Cory Gardner (Colorado), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) all represent states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare; other than Gardner, they are all from states won easily by President Trump. There will likely be some accommodation on both sides.\n\nTrump’s approval ratings are not high, but so far Republicans like what they see. As Gallup reported recently, while his overall standing is below average for a new president, his 87 percent approval among Republicans trails only George W. Bush among all GOP presidents elected in the past seven decades. Another data point that is encouraging for the White House: 45 percent of the country thinks the U.S. is heading in the right direction – a higher number than for any single week of Obama’s presidency.\n\nRelated: House GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nThe White House will spend considerable political capital to sell the bill. A full-bore communications effort is underway, touting among other things, the bill’s simplicity. Whereas the ornate mandates of Obamacare occupied 2,400 pages, the initial measure from the House Commerce Committee is only 66 pages.\n\nAs they roll out their program and seek to remind voters why changes are necessary, the White House should quote one of the great communicators of our day.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Flint, Michigan last October, President Clinton summarized some of the ACA’s defects: “You’ve got this crazy system where all [of a] sudden 25 million more people have healthcare, and then the people are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.”\n\nClinton is right, and he was also correct when he noted that the ACA “works fine” for those who receive Obamacare subsidies or who are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid but that “The people who are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.”\n\nTrump should bring Clinton aboard to sell Americans on the new bill; that would be a heck of an artful deal."

    "text": "The fiscal impact of the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act may not be clear at the federal level until the Congressional Budget Office completes its review of the proposed legislation, but an analysis of the plan by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that one thing is pretty clear: State budgets are going to get pummeled if the proposal as written becomes law.\n\nEdwin Park, CBPP’s vice president for health policy, issued an updated analysis of the plan’s proposed changes to the Medicaid program and determined that the American Health Care Act would cost states $370 billion in federal aid over ten years -- a number that would begin increasing even more sharply as time went on.\n\nRelated: Conservatives Don’t Like What They See in the Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n“The new House Republican health plan would shift an estimated $370 billion in Medicaid costs to states over the next ten years,” Park claims, “effectively ending the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion for 11 million people while also harming tens of millions of additional seniors, people with disabilities, and children and parents who rely on Medicaid today.”\n\nThe long-awaited replacement plan, released late Monday, would turn Medicaid into a block grant program, meaning that states would receive a fixed amount of money based on the number of people on the Medicaid rolls in a given year. The existing program is an entitlement and per-state spending is not capped.\n\nThe proposal would also effectively eliminate the Medicaid expansion under which the ACA allowed certain eligible working-age adults access to the program. The federal government previously bore 90 percent of the costs of that expansion.\n\nHowever, according to Park, “Starting in 2020, states would receive only the regular federal Medicaid matching rate — on average, 57 percent of Medicaid costs, with states covering the other 43 percent — for any new enrollees under the expansion instead of the ACA’s matching rate of 90 percent. This means that expansion states would have to pay 2.8 to 5 times more in terms of their own costs.”\n\nRelated: House GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nPeople who were on the plan as of the end of 2019 would be allowed to remain, with the ACA’s original matching rate still applying, but new recipients would not. But because most people on Medicaid tend to fall off the rolls within a few years, the end result would be an ever-dwindling share of recipients were still eligible for the 90 percent match.\n\nStates would still technically be allowed to offer expanded coverage, but Park notes that “within just a few years, the overwhelming share of Medicaid expansion spending would eventually be subject to the regular matching rate. To maintain the expansion as it’s now operating in the expansion states, we estimate that these states would have to increase their share of costs by about $253 billion over ten years.”\n\nThe cap on per-patient spending would also rise more slowly than the cost of care is expected to in coming years, meaning that the block grants to states will, in effect, buy less and les coverage as time goes on.\n\n“In response,” writes Park, “states would have to contribute much more of their own funding or, far likelier, substantially cut eligibility, benefits, and provider payments, with those cuts growing more severe each year.”"

    "text": "It was always going to be difficult for Republicans to get a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act through the Senate, where losing as few as two senators would require Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote, and losing three would doom the measure to failure. But now that the legislative language of the bill is public, it’s beginning to look as though even getting the bill through the House of Representatives will be a tough slog.\n\nThe text of the proposed American Health Care Act had been a closely-held secret until it was released, and now that the more conservative members of Congress are getting a good look at it, they aren’t happy.\n\nRelated: House GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan Has Major Gaps in Cost and Coverage\n\nThe ACHA would replace the income-based subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act with age-based premium supports in the form of refundable tax credits, something many lawmakers in the ultra-conservative House Liberty Caucus object to.\n\nLiberty Caucus chair Justin Amash (R-MI) tweeted out a succinct condemnation of the bill Monday night, calling it “Obamacare 2.0.”\n\nTexas Rep. Louie Gohmert complained, “It creates a new entitlement program and I've already heard from some constituents upset about [it]. We're calling it tax credits, where we actually send people checks. I guess it's another way to do the subsidy.”\n\nMembers of the influential House Freedom Caucus also came out against the bill.\n\nVirginia Representative Dave Brat, in an appearance on National Public Radio, said that the drafters of the bill had relied too much on the existing structure of the Affordable Care Act. “It keeps too many of the bad pieces, which will collide with each other and it will collapse,” he said. “We didn’t run on this ... we voted on the 2015 plan through the House and the Senate, which was a repeal.”\n\nIn a commentary published on the Fox News website, Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows of North Carolina, writing with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, called the proposal “Obamacare-lite” and demanded that Republican leadership revive the “clean repeal” bill that passed both houses of Congress.\n\nRelated: Fiscal Cost of House GOP Obamacare Replacement Remains a Mystery\n\n“Republicans across America ran on repealing the Big Government takeover of our health care system that is ObamaCare ... We call on Congressional leaders to keep their word to the American people, to push a real repeal of ObamaCare, and to do it now.”\n\nThey added, “If anyone tells you there isn’t a plan that can both keep our promises to repeal, and work in a bipartisan, open way for replace, tell them conservatives have a plan to do just that. Now let’s hope our leadership will listen, because it is the only way they’re going to get our votes.”\n\nCriticism from the leaders of the Liberty and Freedom caucuses in the House is significant because between them (there is considerable overlap in membership) they have more than enough members to block the bill’s passage.\n\nOver in the Senate, the proposal’s prospects looked even grimmer. On Twitter Tuesday morning, Sen. Paul predicted the current bill would fail. “The House leadership plan is Obamacare Lite. It will not pass,” he wrote. “Conservatives are not going to take it.”\n\nIn the closely divided Senate -- even looking at a bill that will be immune to the filibuster because of its status as a budget reconciliation measure -- Republicans cannot afford to lose more than two votes, and Paul isn’t the only member of the GOP who’s balking.\n\nRelated: Top Trump Advisers Differ Over Whether Medicare Reform Is ‘On the Table’\n\nRob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have all expressed reservations about the bill, saying that they are concerned it will harm low-income residents in their states by, among other things, block-granting Medicaid.\n\nTwo other conservative senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, have suggested that they won’t support a bill that retains elements of Obamacare.\n\nAnd it’s a virtual certainty that Republicans won’t be getting any help from Democrats in their effort to destroy the signature domestic policy accomplishment of the most recent Democrat to hold the White House.\n\nKentucky Congressman John Yarmuth, ranking member of the House Budget Committee, released a blistering statement on Tuesday, saying, “After seven years of campaign promises, Congressional Republicans still do not have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Instead, they’ve released two bills that will lead to higher costs, lower-quality care, and lost coverage for millions of Americans. These proposals will kick millions of Americans off Medicaid and could eventually send deductibles soaring to as high as $30,000 per family, all to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.”\n\nIn a tense press conference on Tuesday, the two architects of the bill asked their colleagues for patience and to approach the debate over the bill in a spirit of cooperation.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in its Tracks\n\nRep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, challenged the idea that the bill is “Obamacare-lite,” saying it is, in fact, “Obamacare-gone.”\n\nGreg Walden of Oregon, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, tried to reassure lawmakers worried about the impact the bill would have on the poor. “We will keep our promise to not pull the rug out from anyone, including those on Medicaid.”\n\nBoth of their committees are expected to begin considering the legislation Wednesday."

    "text": "New data from the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service shows that the agency audited barely more than one million individual tax returns in 2016, the lowest number since 2004, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. The number of audits dropped by 16 percent from the previous year, marking the sixth consecutive year of decline.\n\nThe IRS is reeling from a proposed 14 percent cut in their operating budget for the coming year, and says that its tax enforcement and audit operations are in their sorriest state in more than a decade.\n\nRelated: IRS Now Pegs Tax Cheating by Americans at $458 Billion Annually\n\nLong under attack by GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill – especially since the agency admitted targeting conservatives for tax scrutiny in the 2012 election -- the IRS in recent years has been forced to make significant cutbacks in audits and tax compliance operations. That in turn has led to widespread tax cheating and major revenue losses for the U.S. Treasury. Last year, the IRS reported a jaw-dropping $458 billion average annual difference between taxes that were owed and actually paid, a 5.5 percent increase.\n\nNow the new Trump administration has targeted the agency for an additional 14.1 percent budget cut in fiscal 2018 as part of a government wide drive to slash spending to help pay for a $54 billion increase in defense and national security.\n\nThe new report may be the IRS’s way of making the case to the White House budget office that another round of operating cuts would be foolish if the government is serious about going after tax scofflaws."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/07/Fiscal-Cost-House-GOP-Obamacare-Replacement-Remains-Mystery",
    "text": "House Republicans finally revealed their plan to undo President Obama's Affordable Care Act on Monday night, releasing legislative language for what they are calling the American Health Care Act. However, even as they tout the bill as a fiscally responsible alternative to the existing system they have long derided as bloated and failing, they seem ready to advance their alternative through the House committee system without an official estimate of its cost or the impact it will have on the accessibility of insurance coverage.\n\nAs proposed, the bill would take a number of drastic steps to change the way health insurance is paid for in the United States. Chief among them is the transformation of Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement program to a block grant in which states would receive a fixed amount of money to cover each person enrolled in the program.\n\nRelated: Top Trump Advisers Differ Over Whether Medicare Reform Is ‘On the Table’\n\nThe bill would also eliminate the individual and employer mandates of the ACA, which require individuals to purchase health insurance if they don’t receive it through their employer or a government program and mandates that employers of a certain size offer workers coverage.\n\nThe ACA’s complicated system of income-based subsidies that was meant to help lower-income people pay for insurance would be replaced by a system of refundable tax credits that vary in value not by income but by age, but which also phase out for high-income individuals. The credits would start at $2,000 a year for people under 30, and rise to $4,000 for people over 60.\n\nThe bill would also create more generous health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside income tax-free for the payment of health care costs.\n\nThe bill would retain several popular elements of the ACA, including the right of children to stay on their parents’ health plans until age 26. It would also continue to prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions and from imposing yearly or lifetime caps on benefits.\n\nRelated: 3 Basic Problems Holding Up the GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nIn a statement released late Monday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, “The American Health Care Act is a plan to drive down costs, encourage competition, and give every American access to quality, affordable health insurance. It protects young adults, patients with pre-existing conditions, and provides a stable transition so that no one has the rug pulled out from under them.”\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, President Trump tweeted, “Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!”\n\nHowever, there are numerous questions about the effect the House GOP plan would have on both individuals seeking health coverage on the open market and on the federal budget.\n\nThe popular elements of the ACA — particularly the ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the elimination of benefit caps — were also very expensive for insurers. The trade-off that made those concessions palatable to insurers was that coverage for all Americans was mandated, assuring an increase in the number of policyholders to offset the increased costs of sicker customers.\n\nBy requiring insurers to continue offering those benefits without the promise of an expanded pool of insurance customers, the bill virtually guarantees some combination of higher prices and fewer benefits for policies offering the same level of coverage as under the ACA.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Replacement: What Republicans Can Learn From Socialized Medicine\n\nAt the same time, the House plan would remove some of the minimum requirements for health plans, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones policies that offer relatively little coverage in exchange for lower premiums.\n\nThe impact of the bill on the federal budget remains something of a mystery. Both the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees are expected to take up the legislation as early as Wednesday, before the Congressional Budget Office can estimate the cost of the legislation or its impact on overall levels of health insurance coverage.\n\nBoth are major questions. The bill would repeal several taxes that were used to fund the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, costing the government billions of dollars in annual revenue. They include a surtax on the super-wealthy and a tax on the compensation of insurance company executives. The bill would forego still more revenue by eliminating the tax penalty on people who choose to go without health insurance.\n\nIt would also delay the so-called “Cadillac Tax,” a 40 percent tax on employer-provided plans that cost more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families that was scheduled to take effect in 2020. The Republican plan would push off implementation until 2025.\n\nRelated: The Medical Technology That Could Save the US Billions Each Year\n\nEarly Tuesday, when it became apparent that House committees were prepared to move forward on the proposal without a budget score, Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tweeted: “Need to see CBO score. Lawmakers should not support a bill without seeing the score.”\n\nThis article was updated to correct details abouot the Cadillac Tax."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/07/House-GOP-Obamacare-Replacement-Plan-Has-Major-Gaps-Cost-and-Coverage",
    "text": "House Republicans Monday night unveiled their long-anticipated plan to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a conservative, market-based approach that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) guaranteed would drive down health insurance costs, spark competition and provide every American with “access to quality, affordable health insurance.”\n\nThe plan, more than six years in the making – including highly secretive talks during the past week involving top House GOP leaders, powerful conservative factions, Republican governors and the Trump Administration – seeks to achieve several central goals of the party.\n\nRelated: 3 Basic Problems Holding Up the GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nIt would finally eviscerate Obamacare’s much reviled individual mandate that requires Americans to purchase insurance or pay a penalty. It would phase out by 2020 expanded Medicaid benefits to poor people in 31 states and the District of Columbia. It would eliminate a requirement that larger companies provide health insurance for their workers.\n\nAnd it would replace Obamacare’s premium subsidies for low and middle-income people with a “refundable” tax credit plan that would help many more Americans buy insurance on the open market. All but wealthier Americans would qualify for set premium supports ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 a year, with the highest support level going to older people who generally have higher premiums and medical costs than younger, healthier people.\n\n“Obamacare is a sinking ship, and the legislation introduced today will rescue people from the mistakes of the past,” Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House Majority Leader, said in a statement.\n\nThe GOP alternative approach would also embrace ideas that have been aired repeatedly by Ryan, GOP policy analysts and President Trump himself, including tax-exempt health savings accounts, allowing insurers to sell their policies across state lines, and creation of so-called “risk pools” in every state to help provide coverage for hard to insure older and sicker people.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in Its Tracks\n\nFinally, the plan would preserve two of the most popular features of Obamacare – the ban on insurance companies discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical conditions and a provision allowing children to remain on their parents’ health care policies through age 26.\n\nAnd yet for all the Republicans’ complaints about Obamacare’s soaring premiums, shrinking choices of health insurance plans and onerous mandates and rules, they have finally come up with a plan that is highly flawed and woefully incomplete – and lacking in vital details as to how much it will cost and how many Americans will be able to hang onto their insurance.\n\nThe House Republicans’ “American Health Care Act” creates a new set of winners and losers among consumers, with younger, healthier and wealthier people faring much better than under Obamacare while older, sicker people doing less well.\n\nThis is the result of a combination of factors, including a new tax credit premium subsidy plan that benefits a much broader income group than does Obamacare, as well as changes that would allow insurers to charge more than they can now for health care policies in the individual market and scale back the benefits they must provide.\n\nThe Republican approach would also jettison an Obamacare stricture preventing insurers from charging their oldest enrollees, in their 50s and 60s, any more than three times what they charge their youngest customers. And consumers who have a lengthy break in their health insurance coverage – either because they lost their jobs or decided to do without coverage for a while -- could be slapped with a steep 30 percent surcharge when they seek to purchase a new policy.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\n“In the aggregate, these changes could be advantageous to younger and healthier enrollees who want skimpier (and cheaper) benefit packages,” noted Sarah Kliff of Vox. “But they could be costly for older and sicker Obamacare enrollees, who rely on the law’s current requirements.”\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats have shown no indication they will support a Republican repeal and replacement effort, and they immediately denounced the House GOP plan as a serious setback in federal health care policy. “Trumpcare doesn’t replace the Affordable Care Act, it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), said in a statement.\n\nAmong the most glaring problems of the House GOP replacement plan:\n\nThe tax credit had to be scaled back so much to placate conservative critics that it’s not likely to be able to match or even come close to the tax subsidies provided to low and middle-income people under Obamacare.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nUnlike Obamacare, which provides premium subsidies based on income to low and moderate income people, the House GOP plan would make the tax credit available to individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and couples making up to $150,000. Younger Americans would qualify for tax credits of between $2,000 and $2,500 while older people in their 50s and 60s would qualify for credits of between $3,500 and $4,000.\n\nWhile on the face of it, older Americans would fare best of all, their higher tax credits would be offset by having to pay much higher premiums than before under Obamacare. Moreover, the 9.4 million people currently receiving premium subsidies through Obamacare exchanges get on average $291 per month or a significant portion of the $386 per month average premium for people who obtained coverage through Healthdcare.gov. Critics warn that many people would have a hard time under the GOP subsidy plan finding insurance in the private market that they could afford.\n\nRelated: It’s High Time for Tax Reform, but the Republicans Are Doing It Wrong\n\nMany conservative Republicans and outside groups have opposed refundable tax credits, largely because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, would receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. Conservative critics including Sens., Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), have dismissed the refundable tax credit as “Obamacare Lite” and want it stricken from any final replacement plan.\n\nRepublican leaders have yet to find a way to finance their program because business leaders and conservative groups complained too much about a proposal for raising tens of billions of dollars by imposing a cap on a highly generous tax exemption for employer-sponsored health care policies. In the short term, Republicans will leave in place a handful of Obamacare tax increases that have long been criticized by the GOP. Those include taxes on insurers, hospitals, drug companies and even tanning salons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no way of telling at this point how much the plan will cost or how many people are likely to lose their coverage. That’s because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation have yet to complete their analysis of the plan. GOP leaders appear willing to forge ahead with committee action on their plan this week, even without the analysis.\n\nDemocrats are clamoring for evidence that the GOP approach would result in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage in the coming year or two, and want to see the CBO report first. “The American people deserve to see what Republicans are trying to do to their health care,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\n\n\nThe GOP bill includes what some moderate Republicans consider a “poison pill” – a one-year elimination of federal Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood to placate the party’s influential anti-abortion forces. Although federal law prohibits Planned Parenthood from using federal funds and grants for abortion services, abortion foes argue that the federal funding is fungible and might end up indirectly supporting abortions.\n\nFinally, the American Health Care Act would permit the 31 states with expanded Medicaid benefits for childless adults and others to continue that coverage through January 2020 when the program would be frozen and then gradually phased out. This represents a victory for the 15 Republican governors whose states opted for the expanded, federally funded Medicaid who fought to prevent an immediate end to the program.\n\nHowever, some moderate Republicans are not satisfied with the compromise and are vowing to oppose the plan unless they are assured that Medicaid would be spared major cuts or converted into block grants or per capita payments to the states. On Monday, four Republican senators signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying that an earlier draft of the House GOP plan did not adequately protect people from losing their expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe senators –- Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska –- threatened to oppose the legislation unless that Medicaid coverage was preserved. Any two of them could stop the legislation in its tracks once it reaches the Senate by opposing the measure on the floor."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/07/One-Way-Trump-s-Administration-Really-Fine-Tuned-Machine",
    "text": "The government-by-mood-ring fluctuations of the Trump presidency have corrected the myth that politicians conjure up devious plans to manipulate the public years in advance. It’s beyond clear that Trump’s grand strategy carries only the forethought it takes to randomly bang out 140 characters on a smartphone. However, amid the wild lane changes, there is actually one well-oiled machine operating in Washington: the bulldozer scooping up government regulations and tossing them into the dumpster.\n\nThe New York Times offered a definitive account of this Monday, identifying over 90 rules that have been delayed or overturned in just the first month and a half of the new presidency. This earth-moving falls into a few buckets. First, dozens of rules that had been moving through the Obama administration bureaucracy but hadn’t reached completion were halted. Second, under the Congressional Review Act, rules finalized after June 2016 can be reversed by a majority vote in both houses of Congress, with agencies barred from making substantially similar rulemakings in the future without legislative consent.\n\nRelated: Here’s Who Wins With Trump’s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nAlready, three CRA resolutions have become law, blocking anti-corruption disclosures by oil and gas companies, protection for waterways from mining waste, and the Social Security Administration’s delivery of mental health information to the gun background check system. Nearly 30 other CRA resolutions have been introduced; more are scheduled for votes this week.\n\nSpecific rules have also been targeted for removal, like the Labor Department directive that investment advisors act in the best interest of their clients, the requirement that automakers average 54 miles per gallon in their vehicle fleets by 2025 and the EPA’s expansion of rivers and streams protected under the Clean Water Act. Trump has suspended a proposal to force disclosure of all airline passenger fees and stopped a reduction in mortgage insurance fees through the Federal Housing Administration. Industry executives and their lobbyists have written up wish lists for which rules they want taken down, and the administration is dutifully following through.\n\nThis mainly pushes the regulatory state back to where it was last year; the lion’s share of Obama-era rules remain on the books. But if the books sit on a shelf, nobody has to care about the contents. The way you really gut regulations is by hiring people who have no interest in enforcing them. Instead of writing a rule to overhaul the H1-B visa program for high-skilled workers, you merely stop processing expedited applications. Instead of rolling back Securities and Exchange Commission rules, you just don’t send SEC investigators to major bond conferences; traders get the implicit message. Simply hiring Scott Pruitt, whose political career has been dedicated to working with industry to undermine the EPA, to oversee that very agency, cripples environmental regulation overnight.\n\nRelated: Big Oil Gets a Win as Trump Ends Transparency Rule\n\nRelatedly, a government-wide hiring freeze and devastating budget cuts at specific agencies provides an excuse to maintain yawning gaps in oversight. Unfilled positions throughout the government have been left vacant seemingly by design, to overburden the regulators into laissez-faire non-compliance. The White House even put moles inside every agency to search for more rules to neutralize. And what about dissident, independent regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose budget Congress cannot touch? The administration is building a case to decapitate its leadership.\n\nDeregulation has been so successful because the White House and Republicans in Congress agree on its importance. But what is the actual purpose of all this clear-cutting? More limited government is a conservative end in itself, but ask any Republican and they’ll call deregulation a jobs program. Does that hold up?\n\nNo. Just thinking back to 2008, when a concerted effort to neglect mortgage and securities regulations led to the largest job loss in nearly a century, should disabuse anyone of this notion. Former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan admitted to Congress that year that “voluntary regulation does not work,” a flaw in his thinking that he somehow only figured out after Wall Street nearly blew up the economy.\n\nConservatives characterize regulations as “job-killing” through a cock-eyed viewpoint I’d call “cost-cost analysis.” They tally up the financial burdens of complying with federal regulations — $1.9 trillion in 2016, per the Competitive Enterprise Institute — while ignoring any of the public benefits to stopping pollution or hazardous workplaces or self-dealing on Wall Street. A 2011 retrospective study of the Clean Air Act found the benefits outweighed the costs by 25-1. But the ability to breathe freely isn’t a part of the deregulators’ calculations.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Opportunity to Slash 179,000 Pages of Federal Regulations\n\nIn reality, virtually every independent study on the subject finds that regulations do not affect the overall level of jobs in the economy. Certain sectors might see a reduction, while others rise. Some jobs become obsolete, while others flourish. Lack of demand has a much larger impact on job loss than regulations ever will. The yoke of regulations has become a convenient excuse for industries destined to fail. For example, Republicans claim regulators have waged a “war on coal.” However, market forces, like the cost of natural gas and other energy sources dropping well below that of coal, are far more to blame for the industry’s demise.\n\nUndeniably, deregulation saves companies lots of money in compliance and legal costs. But you need only look at one indicator, the stock market, to understand to whom that money ultimately flows. Trump’s election has coincided with a boom in equity prices. And what do stocks measure? Expected future profits, not capital investment or job creation. Soaring stocks, particularly in industries to which the market believes Trump will hand a lifeline, tell you what gets done with all of the savings on compliance. It goes to the executives and the shareholders, not to workers or consumers. The benefits, in short, don’t get passed on; they stay in the C-suites and the stock portfolios.\n\nIn essence, deregulation represents a giant tax cut for corporate America. The idea that it unleashes corporations only so they can share their newfound fortunes borders on the ridiculous. While America chokes, drinks water with more dirt in it, handles unsafe chemicals on the job and allows financiers to reopen their gambling parlors, corporate executives celebrate, not by hiring more employees but by counting their money."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/How-New-Trump-Travel-Ban-Could-Hurt-US-Economy",
    "text": "The travel and tourism and industry had been hoping that the Trump administration’s second effort at a travel ban would be more welcoming to foreign travelers coming to the United States. They were disappointed.\n\nA new executive order signed today reaffirms the elimination of the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows frequent travelers to the United States an expedited way of renewing their visas. It also proposes an extensive new program of “Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs” that will almost certainly make travel to the United States much more inconvenient for people from many countries.\n\nRelated: Whatever the Courts Say, Trump’s Travel Ban Is Already Working\n\nThe new order replaces the controversial one that Trump signed in late January, and which was subsequently challenged in court after it left hundreds of people with valid travel documents stranded in airports around the world.\n\nAmong other things, the order signed today does a lot of cleanup work necessitated by its predecessor. It clarifies the status of legal permanent residents and people holding valid visas, and goes into detail about possible case-by-case exceptions. The new order removes Iraq from the list of countries whose residents are barred from entering the U.S. for 90 days, a move that had infuriated the many Iraqis actively fighting alongside U.S. advisers against the terror group ISIS. The other six countries from the original list -- Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Sudan -- remain.\n\nThe order also creates a 120-day halt to the Refugee Admissions Program, citing concerns that terrorists might be able to infiltrate groups of legitimate refugees to gain entry to the country.\n\nHowever, while the highest profile element of the new executive order is its effect on refugees and residents of the designated countries, there is good reason to worry that it will have a negative effect on many U.S. businesses that rely on tourism.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nFirst of all, eliminating the Visa Interview Waiver Program will make it much more inconvenient for business travelers from many countries to repeatedly enter the United States. Every time a visa expires, they will be required to submit to a sit-down interview with a consular official in their home country in order to get it renewed. Previously, they were allowed to drop off their passports at a U.S. embassy or consulate where a visa application would be processed without scheduling an interview.\n\nThe executive order also contemplates a ramped-up vetting process that will make it more difficult and time consuming for people interested in traveling to the United States as tourists to get here in the first place.\n\nThe order calls for “a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.”\n\nThere was already significant concern among the businesses that rely on travelers that the first version of the Trump travel ban was costing them business. And they represent a significant share of the U.S. economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, bringing in nearly half a trillion dollars in 2015, or just over 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nRelated: Trump Adds a Nixonian Loyalty Test to His Travel Ban\n\nAnd the travel industry may be only the most obvious victim of a drop-off in travel to the United States. For example, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities issued a statement warning that the new executive order “remains overly broad in scope and threatens to adversely impact higher education in America. While we understand and respect the president’s stated goal of securing our homeland, we also believe that a categorical ban on the entry of individuals based purely on national origin will undermine the ability of our public institutions to attract the best minds to teach and study at our state colleges and universities.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/Top-Trump-Advisers-Differ-Over-Whether-Medicare-Reform-Table",
    "text": "Barely a week after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared that President Trump would make good on his campaign pledge not to go after Medicare and other entitlement programs, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in effect “not so fast.”\n\nPrice, the former conservative House Budget Committee chair and orthopedic surgeon who was brought aboard by Trump to oversee the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, declined to rule out cuts or other changes in Medicare for seniors during an appearance Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation.\n\n\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Promises No Budget Cuts to Social Security and Medicare\n\nAsked by host John Dickerson whether House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was correct in saying recently that Medicare reform was “still on the table” as part of budget negotiations this year, Price essentially dodged the question and declined to contradict Ryan. Instead, he launched into a warning about Medicare’s shaky long-term finances.\n\n“The challenge that we have, as you well know and your viewers know, is that Medicare is, as some folks have said, going insolvent or going broke,” Price said. “Within a ten-year period, we won’t have the money in the Medicare program to be able to pay the benefits to seniors in this country that has been promised to them. We don’t think that’s appropriate.”\n\n“So we believe in -- strongly in the guarantee of Medicare and make certain that it’s a viable, financially secure program going forward so that seniors now, and in the future, know that it will be there for them,” Price added.\n\nPrice’s homily on fiscal discipline was a far cry from Mnuchen’s comments a week ago and suggests a rift within the administration over whether to begin tinkering with the federal health insurance program for seniors that covers more than 55 million people.\n\n\n\nRelated: 3 Basic Problems Holding Up the GOP Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nMnuchin, a wealthy former Wall Street banker and hedge fund manager, insisted that Trump would adhere to his campaign promises to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, even as the administration seeks deep cuts in other areas to cover the cost of a $54 billion military build up, construction of a wall along the southern border with Mexico, other infrastructure construction and a major tax cut.\n\nAsked by Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network whether the Trump administration “needs to hit entitlements sooner rather than later” with the national debt fast approaching $20 trillion, Mnuchin replied, “We are not touching those now. So don’t expect to see that as part of this budget. We are very focused on other aspects, and that’s what’s very important to us. That’s the president’s priority.”\n\nHowever, Mick Mulvaney, a former conservative Republican House member from South Carolina and the new White House budget director, insisted during his Senate confirmations hearings that he would push for Social Security and Medicare reforms.\n\nMulvaney once called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” that requires overhauling. And Mulvaney and Price have promoted House proposals for converting Medicare into a voucher-type program for tens of millions of future recipients.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for low-income people accounted for nearly $1.8 trillion of the government’s $3.9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. What’s more, with the number of people 65 and over projected to increase by a third over the coming decade, Social Security and Medicare spending are projected to increase to 42 percent of total government outlays by 2027.\n\nMedicare alone will exhaust its reserves and begin curtailing payments in 2028 absent any changes in the programs, according to a report issued last year by the Social Security and Medicare trustees.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Concord Coalition, and other anti-deficit groups have urged Trump to focus on the need for changes to slow the rate of growth of spending on retirement benefits and heath care. However, Trump has repeatedly signaled that efforts to balance the budget must be put on the back burner while he rebuilds the military and energizes the economy with trillions of dollars of new tax cuts.\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nLeon Panetta, a former defense secretary and White House budget director during the Obama and Clinton administrations, said over the weekend that Trump and the Republican controlled Congress must come to an agreement on a budget “that really deals with this $20 trillion debt that we face.”\n\n“What you have got to do is put everything on the table,” Panetta, a deficit hawk, said in a separate “Face the Nation appearance. “You have got to put entitlements, you have to put taxes, and you have to put discretionary. That’s what we did in the past. That’s how we got a balanced budget.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/06/3-Basic-Problems-Holding-GOP-Obamacare-Replacement-Plan",
    "text": "With growing indications that the repeal and replace movement is in disarray in the House and Senate, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees intend to take up a plan on Wednesday, with an eye to forcing a vote by the full House in the coming weeks and sending it on to the Senate.\n\nHouse Republicans are attempting to forge a hybrid budget resolution that keeps popular elements of Obamacare – including a ban on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies until age 26 – while scrapping the rest in favor of more conservative measures.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in Its Tracks\n\nHouse aides reportedly worked around the clock over the weekend to come up with the language of the complex legislation, with input from Ryan, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and other Trump advisers. AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Ryan, declared that the Republicans were “now at the culmination of a years’ long promise to keep our promise to the American people” to repeal Obamacare.\n\nYet GOP leaders and the White House are caught between conflicting pressures. On the one hand, conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups are demanding the evisceration of every facet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act – including all mandates, premium subsidies and tax increases to finance the program. On the other hand, more moderate Republican lawmakers and governors, fearful of stripping millions of Americans of Obamacare and expanded Medicaid coverage, are urging a more cautious approach.\n\nAlthough the latest House GOP plan has been kept under strict lock and key to give opponents less time to review and attack the approach, details began leaking out over the weekend suggesting that there are still three major disputes holding back agreement in the House.\n\n1. Refundable tax credit. Ryan and Price have long favored a refundable tax credit that would be available to all Americans for use in purchasing health insurance in the private market. Unlike Obamacare, which provides premium subsidies based on income to low and moderate income people, the House GOP plan would make the tax credit available to all Americans – but based on age rather than income. In general, older, wealthier Americans would receive more in credits than younger, less wealthy people.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nBut many conservative Republicans have opposed refundable tax credits, largely because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, would receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. Conservative critics including Sens., Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), have dismissed the refundable tax credit as “Obamacare Lite” and want it stricken from any replacement plan.\n\nFor now the tax credit remains in the House GOP plan, but House Republicans are considering a change that would deny the credit to the wealthiest Americans, according to Politico. No decision has been reached yet on what the threshold should be.\n\n2. Medicaid expansion. Currently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have signed up for an expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare in which the federal government pays about 90 percent of the bill for health care coverage to roughly 10 million low income adults who previously didn’t qualify for the program. Conservatives want to rescind the program and cut back on Medicaid spending, while many governors and lawmakers are demanding that the expanded program remain in place.\n\nThe latest House Republican plan would eliminate Medicaid expansion by 2020, according to Politico. States could continue to provide coverage if they choose, but they would receive far less federal assistance to do so. Moreover, Congress would also convert traditional Medicaid into a block grant or per capita payment to the states. Those steps taken together would almost certainly slash enrollments in Medicaid, which currently total about 70 million, and reduce the benefit level over time.\n\nRep. Greg Walden, chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, told reporters over the weekend that the Republicans don’t intend to “pull the rug out from under” Medicaid beneficiaries, but that the program isn’t financially “sustainable” without major surgery.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\n3. Taxes. Any GOP replacement plan will cost a lot of money, perhaps even more than Obamacare’s $1.2 trillion, 10-year price tag. So if the existing Obamacare taxes on individuals, businesses and the health care industry are stricken from the books, as conservatives demand, the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers will have to replace those lost revenues.\n\nRepublicans could claim billions of dollars in savings through budgetary maneuvers and dynamic scoring to offset some of the cost, at least on paper. But House GOP leaders are also pushing to cap the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance – the biggest loophole in the federal tax code. The House plan caps the tax exemption for employer-sponsored plans at the 90th percentile of premiums, meaning that the 10 percent most expensive health insurance plans would be taxed."

    "text": "The tension between the White House and the Federal Bureau of Investigation reached what could be a tipping point on Monday morning, when a spokesperson for President Trump said that the president does not accept FBI Director James Comey’s claim that there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump accused his predecessor Barack Obama of ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. On Sunday, reports began appearing in major news outlets that Comey rejected the president’s claim outright and that he had asked the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, to issue a statement challenging Trump’s claim.\n\nRelated: Competing Narratives in Trump ‘Wiretap’ Story Lack Facts\n\nThe Justice Department has not weighed in so far. But after news of Comey’s pushback surfaced, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s Good Morning America if Trump accepted the FBI director’s word on the subject.\n\n“You know, I don't think he does, George,” she replied. “I think he firmly believes that this is a storyline that has been reported pretty widely by quite a few outlets. The wiretapping has been discussed in The New York Times, BBC, Fox News and we believe that it should be looked at by the House Intelligence Committee.”\n\nThe stories she cited, as Stephanopoulos pointed out immediately, do not actually back up Trump’s claim that there was a presidential directive to place Trump Tower under surveillance.\n\nTrump adviser Kellyanne Conway joined the fray on Fox & Friends, restating Trump’s claim that there was wiretapping and hinting that Trump knows things that others do not. \"He's the president of the United States,\" Conway said. \"He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.\" Whether Trump knows things that Comey does not was not addressed.\n\nTrump himself invoked the specter of Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal over the weekend, comparing Obama’s alleged surveillance of his office tower to the former president’s use of the executive branch to harass his enemies.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wiretap Accusation\n\nHowever, the more apt comparison here might be another moment in Nixon’s troubled history: his demand that Attorney General Elliot Richardson fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the Watergate affair. Nixon’s order prompted Richardson to resign. He was followed out the door by Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, who also refused to fire Cox.\n\nRichardson and Ruckelshaus were put in a position where they were forced to choose between serving the president and maintaining their personal integrity. Comey’s position is similar, except that rather than ask him to compromise his principles, Trump has questioned the FBI director’s integrity indirectly.\n\nAs one of the nation’s top law enforcement officials, Comey is in what seems to be an untenable position. Being questioned by the president, however unfairly, will open up Comey and the agents who work for him to claims that other cases are being brought under dubious circumstances. For that reason, his resignation has become a real possibility.\n\nIf he doesn’t resign, it’s hard to see how he doesn’t get fired. Given the extraordinary power of the FBI director, it would be difficult for the White House to fail to demand Comey’s resignation. If the president really believes that Comey isn’t speaking truthfully to the public, the only responsible step would be to immediately replace him."

    "text": "The storm of controversy unleashed over the weekend by President Trump’s extraordinary Twitter-based accusation that his predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered unspecified government agents to wiretap Trump Tower in the weeks before last year’s presidential election had descended, by Monday, into an exercise in hair-splitting by both the president’s supporters and his opponents.\n\nLate Sunday, The New York Times reported that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey had asked the Department of Justice to officially deny reports that his agency had been directed by the Obama White House to tap the phone lines in Trump Tower. That came after Ken Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, issued a statement that read, “A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Weekend Tweets Cause an Uproar Over Wiretap Accusation\n\nCrucially, neither of those denials goes as far as to say that there was no surveillance of people within Trump’s orbit prior to the campaign. In fact, leaks from intelligence agencies have, for months, indicated the opposite, even if the surveillance was not necessarily directed at them.\n\nTrump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after information leaked revealing that he had a number of contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, and then misled others in the administration about them. Other reports have suggested that multiple people working for the Trump campaign had repeated contacts with Russian officials during the run-up to the election.\n\nPlainly, there was considerable investigative work related to the connections between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. However, what that does not do, despite the assertions of Trump’s supporters, is prove that the most incendiary element of Trump’s weekend Twitter rampage is the truth.\n\nTrump repeatedly and emphatically claimed that President Obama personally directed surveillance activity against him, and insinuated that he did so with the aim of compromising the election process.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Real Puzzle About the Trump-Russia Connection\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nFirst, it should be noted that if Obama really did direct the powers of the surveillance state against the Republican presidential candidate with the aim of throwing the election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, it was a pretty spectacular failure. This is particularly so, given that some of the information about the alleged contacts between Trump associates and the Russians appears to have been collected prior to the election, but was only leaked afterward.\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nBut there is no good reason to assume, as some of Trump’s allies are willing to do, that the surveillance resulted from a direct White House order. The FBI and the nation’s security services routinely monitor the communications of Russian officials and agents operating in the United States. If a member or members of the Trump administration were picked up during that monitoring because they were the second party in a conversation -- as appears to have happened with Flynn, who reportedly spoke to Kislyak on the phone from Trump Tower -- it is not evidence of an effort to surveil Trump.\n\nBoth sides, in this case, seem to be trying to twist the other’s position into the most extreme version possible.\n\nTrump’s detractors are claiming that his allegation of surveillance at Trump Tower is completely unfounded. But they aren’t completely divorced from the truth. It’s known at this point that at least some Trump associates had their communications monitored, even if they weren’t necessarily the target of that monitoring.\n\nTrump’s supporters are quick to jump on the idea that if that monitoring occurred, then it must have been both directed at Trump and ordered by the White House. At this point, there is little evidence of the first claim and none at all of the second.\n\nNone of these conversations would be happening, of course, if the president wasn’t given to tweeting wild accusations at 6:35 on a Saturday morning."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/06/Obamacare-Replacement-What-Republicans-Can-Learn-Socialized-Medicine",
    "text": "As Republicans struggle to repeal and replace Obamacare, they can find useful ideas in unexpected places: countries that have adopted socialized medicine. While the U.K.’s National Health Service and other health bureaucracies may seem to be the wrong place to seek guidance for a private-market plan, they offer approaches to cost-effectiveness that Republicans will need to embrace if they hope to implement a new health care reform without getting hammered in 2018.\n\nThe core problem for Republicans is that progressives have won the philosophical debate by persuading the public that health care is a right. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the government should ensure universal access to health care. Although conservatives and libertarians make the point that so-called positive rights, like a right to health care, can only be provided through some form of compulsion, this argument no longer resonates. A system that fails to guarantee access to essential care regardless of ability to pay is no longer politically feasible.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won’t Touch Entitlement Reform…Yet​\n\nOnce we recognize that Americans have bought into a fundamentally socialistic idea, the fiscally responsible approach is to fund universal service in the most cost-effective way. Relative to other advanced nations, the United Kingdom offers an especially inexpensive model for providing health care. In 2015, health care spending in the U.K. was only $4,003 per person, less than half the $9,451 per person we spend in the U.S. Despite its sharply lower spending, the U.K. enjoys higher life expectancy at birth than the U.S. — 81.4 years versus 78.8 years here. While violent crime, accidents, poor nutrition and lack of exercise contribute to relatively low life expectancy in the U.S., it is hard to believe that we would significantly outperform the U.K. even if these factors were somehow equalized.\n\nTo understand why the U.K. gets better results (at least in terms of longevity), we need to take a brief detour into budgeting theory. Governments use two methods to spend money: appropriations and entitlements. In the U.S., most federal agencies are funded through appropriations, meaning Congress assigns them a fixed budget each fiscal year. Agency leaders must then manage within their budgets, implementing cost-saving measures during the year if they are at risk of running out of money. But most medical care is funded through entitlements. Under Medicare and Medicaid, health providers can be reimbursed for whatever services they provide, with no predetermined limit (although there are some exceptions). Because entitlements are unmanaged, they are more subject to escalating costs. As reimbursement rules change, providers find ways to maximize their revenue, while program administrators have no incentive to push back.\n\nRelated: New Report Warns Millions Could Lose Health Care Under GOP Plan\n\nIn the U.K., most medical care is provided by the National Health Service through appropriations. Due to budgetary pressure, health authorities make trade-offs that are now unthinkable in America, but that don’t greatly impact broadly measured health outcomes. Mammograms are generally not available to women under 50 because the benefits of earlier testing usually do not justify the risks of undergoing the procedure. The NHS also does not offer routine colonoscopies, and provides far fewer circumcisions for newborn boys.\n\nThe NHS and other large health care bureaucracies engage in a practice economists call non-price rationing: doling out a scarce resource through government mandate rather than by a market process. While this approach is normally maligned by free-market economists, it is preferable to the alternative we have here in the U.S., which is basically no rationing whatsoever.\n\nPerhaps the worst manifestation of U.K. rationing is the long waits for surgical procedures. Although the NHS officially limits waiting times for elective surgery to 18 weeks, patients often must wait far longer. That said, the U.K. does provide a couple of mechanisms that limit this problem. First, the media and opposition political figures have the freedom and the incentive to embarrass the government into improving patient outcomes. Patients suffering or dying due to long waits can become the focus of news stories and at Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament.\n\nRelated: How 3 GOP Senators Could Stop Obamacare Repeal in its Tracks\n\nAlso, Britain has a robust private health care system that can take some of the weight off of the NHS. About 10 percent of U.K. residents have private health insurance — paid directly or through an employer — that provides access to consultations and procedures over and above what they can get through the NHS. Although progressives might complain that allowing a private market results in a two-tier system, they should realize that total health care equality is a pipe dream.\n\nNon-price rationing produces some bad outcomes, but it has little impact on the U.K.’s overall results because a lot of the medical procedures are unnecessary. Research shows that, beyond a certain basic level, additional care provides little or no benefit. Indeed, research on doctor strikes show that death rates either remain the same or fall when physicians deny access to their services.\n\nTight NHS budgeting is also associated with lower drug prices, more modest salaries for doctors and more deliveries of babies at home by midwives. By contrast, the combination of pervasive third-party payment arrangements and limited cost controls in the U.S. enriches health providers and encourages waste. TV commercials encourage patients to demand brand-name prescription drugs for conditions that could be treated by generic or over-the-counter medications — if they require pharmaceutical intervention at all.\n\nRelated: The Medical Technology That Could Save the US Billions Each Year\n\nTwenty years ago, a case of heartburn might have been handled by rest or a few Tums; now, it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and treated with prescription Nexium. While a one-month supply of Nexium retails for $250, a similar quantity of generic Omeprazole can be had for $17 and over-the-counter Prilosec costs only $18. The main reason doctors prescribe and patients demand the branded prescription drug is that third-party payers cover most of the bill — often with government subsidies.\n\nHospitals also benefit from generous third-party payments. Sutter Health, a not-for-profit hospital chain in Northern California, paid its CEO $7.5 million in 2015. Eighteen other executives received compensation in excess of $1 million each, yet Sutter still reported net income of $81 million. About 60 percent of the organization’s revenue came from state and federal sources. In other words, California and U.S. taxpayers helped the hospital chain and its executives make millions.\n\nCongress can fund universal care without breaking the federal budget by squeezing drug companies, hospitals and other health care providers. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan to introduce block grants for Medicaid, which will effectively oblige states to implement non-price rationing, may be the first step in this direction.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nThe block grant approach could be extended to individuals now receiving large subsidies on Obamacare exchanges and those with costly-to-insure pre-existing conditions. States could respond by giving hospitals fixed annual grants for attending to patients not carrying private insurance, thereby compelling these providers to economize. States could also negotiate lower prices with drug providers and/or migrate patients to generic and over-the-counter remedies. While lobbyists make it difficult for legislators to implement such policies, transitioning away from the entitlement model to one based on appropriations is the way forward."

    "text": "The White House on Sunday refused to walk back President Trump’s startling claim that former President Barack Obama orchestrated a wire tap of Trump Tower late in the 2016 campaign despite a glaring lack of evidence.\n\nIn an apparent effort to distract attention from his administration’s mounting woes over a Justice Department and a congressional investigation into possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian operatives, the hyperbolic Trump on Saturday dispatched early morning Twitter blasts from his West Palm Beach resort declaring that Obama “had my wires tapped.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nTrump described the former president as a “bad (or sick) guy” and likened his behavior to “Nixon/Watergate.” Trump’s top advisers reportedly were startled by the president’s actions and scrambled to contain the damage, just days after Trump received glowing reviews of his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC News today that there have been “quite a few” reports from both main stream and far-right news organizations suggesting that the FBI may have wire tapped Trump’s organization as part of an investigation into links between Trump associates and the Russian government.\n\nTrump’s angry tweets Saturday may have been in response to a report Friday by the alt-right website Breitbart and commentary from conservative talk radio host Mark Levin alleging that Obama used “police state” tactics to monitor Trump’s organization, according to The Washington Post.\n\n“All we’re saying is, let’s take a closer look,” Sanders told ABC’s Martha Raddatz. “If this happened, if this is accurate, this is . . . the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that we have ever seen. It is an attack on democracy itself and the American people have a right to know if this took place.”\n\nRelated: Kremlin: Ambassador Didn’t Meet Sessions (But It Would Have Been OK If He Did)\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer earlier issued a statement defending his boss but saying that Trump and the White House would have no further comments until the House and Senate intelligence committees had completed their probes of Russian influence over the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Obama surrogates lashed back, suggesting that that Trump had gone off the reservation with his unfounded attacks on the former president whom Trump once praised for reaching out to him. Even Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska voiced alarm about Trump’s “very serious allegations” and fretted that “We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public confidence.”\n\nAdministration critics insisted that the president’s tweets won’t detract from mounting evidence that Trump campaign supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, tried to cover up their contacts with Russian at the same time Russian hackers were trying to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.\n\nSessions last Thursday was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department investigation of Russian efforts to meddle in the presidential campaigns following the disclosure that he had met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions withheld that information from the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings in January, which has prompted some Democratic leaders to call for his resignation.\n\nTrump reportedly was furious that Sessions recused himself from the investigation, and berated White House chief of staff Reince Priebus senior adviser Steven Bannon and other top aides for allowing the scandal to overshadow his accomplishments and step on his political message.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\n“There is one page in the Trump crisis management playbook, and that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from the scandal, Josh Earnest, Obama’s White House press secretary, said today on the ABC “This Week” program. “And the bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet.”\n\nEarnest couldn’t totally rule out the possibility that Trump’s organization had been wiretapped by the FBI, but denied that Obama attempted to intervene in the investigation. “This may come as a surprise to the current occupant of the White House, but the president of the United States does not have the authority to unilaterally order the wire tapping of an American citizen.”\n\nHowever, James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence under Obama, denied today that the FBI or Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower before the new president’s inauguration in late January.\n\n“I can deny it,” Clapper told Chuck Todd during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. Clapper, who stepped down as intelligence chief in January, said that “I would know that” if the Justice Department and FBI had obtained an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that would have been needed to tap the Trump organization phones.\n\nRelated: Trump Has a New Reason for His Military Buildup: Job Creation\n\nHe added, however, that his remarks would not apply to potential state or local operations or “other authorized entities in the government.”\n\nThe New York Times reported there is no confirmed evidence that the FBI obtained a court warrant to wire the Trump Organization or was capturing communications directly from the Trump Organization before the election.\n\nHowever, the newspaper previously reported that last fall, the FBI “examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity” between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s biggest banks, whose owners have strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin."

    "text": "Complying with tax laws shouldn't be complicated or punishing to economic growth. Unfortunately, the current tax code is anything but simple, and the price tag of that complexity is enormous. In particular, our high tax rates distort business decisions and are destructive to economic growth. According to an Internal Revenue Service report, corporations alone spent $104 billion complying with the tax code in 2012. That's a ton of money, especially considering that corporate tax revenues are only about $500 billion a year.\n\nIn other words, it’s high time for tax reform. Unfortunately, the House Republicans may be jeopardizing the first opportunity they have had in over 30 years to implement desperately needed tax changes by insisting on one very problematic tax feature on the corporate side called the border adjustment tax. The reform would slap a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States while exempting exports. For the proposal to not become a protectionist tax increase, proponents assume a large and unrealistic strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n\n​Related: Republican Hopes for Tax Reform Hinge on a Trillion-Dollar Gimmick\n\nOne rationale for the border adjustment tax is that other countries’ tax codes give an unfair advantage to their companies over U.S. ones. That’s actually false. First, other countries may have Value Added Taxes that are rebated at the border when companies sell their goods abroad; however, they also have a corporate income tax. The United States is lucky this way, in that it only has a corporate income tax.\n\nSecond, at the retail level the United States taxes goods imported from Japan, for instance, and domestic goods equally. Also each country taxes their companies with a corporate tax. So that’s fair. There’s parity of treatment in Japan too, where goods imported from the U.S. are taxed at the retail levels by the Japanese government the same way as Japanese goods. Again, each country taxes their companies with the corporate tax as well. Also worth noting is that economists have repeatedly debunked the claim that Value Added Tax systems boost exports.\n\nNow, it’s true that U.S. companies are at a competitive disadvantage, but this is because our corporate income tax system has the highest statutory rate of all developed countries, and because — unlike most of our competitors — it taxes U.S. companies’ profits no matter where they’re earned in the world. The solution to this disadvantage is to reduce the rates and move toward a territorial system. That’s what the House plan is trying to do, but it’s going about it the wrong way by adding an import tax and exempting our exports. This behavior opens the United States to a costly challenge before the World Trade Organization, which carries its own set of risks for our country.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nRather than adopt a destructive border tax to address imaginary trade distortions, Congress could address the real problems with our tax code by following the example of the United Kingdom, which decided to leave its competitive disadvantage behind and move to a non-border tax territorial system in 2009. The benefits proved effective by getting rid of a major corporate incentive to leave the U.K. Japan made the same move in 2009 and followed up a few years later by cutting the tax rate.\n\nFinally, it seems that another popular reason for the border adjustment tax is that the new levy, no matter how problematic it is, will help pay for the tax reforms we like. Indeed, the tax is credited for raising $1.2 trillion over 10 years while the economic growth comes from the other aspects of the plan. While the concern for our deficit is understandable, the idea of paying for a pro-growth tax reform by raising taxes is troublesome. Congress should instead pay for lower tax rates and a move to a territorial system through reductions in spending.\n\nThankfully, there are easy ways to achieve that goal. Corporate welfare programs that benefit special corporate interests at the expense of everyone else cost $56 billion annually. Improper payments total $137 billion a year, while there are easily tens of billions of dollars to save from unauthorized appropriations (spending that occurs without having been authorized by Congress). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we could save $68 billion annually by imposing caps on federal spending for Medicaid, $126 billion by repealing all insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act, $41 billion by repealing the individual mandate and $42 billion by ending the tax preferences for employment-based health insurance. We could also save $36 billion a year if Congress converted multiple assistance programs for lower-income Americans into smaller block grants to states, $9 billion if we tightened eligibility rules for food stamps and up to $19 billion by reducing Social Security benefits for new beneficiaries.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Won’t Touch Entitlement Reform…Yet ​\n\nAcademic research consistently shows major benefits to economic growth and efficiency from lowering the corporate income tax rate and moving to a territorial regime. That should be the focus of any corporate tax reform proposal. There are plenty of spending reform options to pay for a reduction in the corporate rate to 20 percent and a move toward a territorial regime without resorting to a border-adjustment tax, which is poorly understood and presents unnecessary risks to the U.S. economy.\n\nVeronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/05/Here-s-What-Trump-s-Merit-Based-Immigration-System-Would-Look",
    "text": "Twice last week, President Trump spoke out in favor of changing the rules under which immigrants are allowed into the United States, praising something he called a “merit-based” system. For Trump, who ran for office on promises of mass deportations, banning Muslims from entering the country, building a wall on the Mexican border and other strongly anti-immigration positions, any positive comments about foreigners entering the country are notable, and deserve some unpacking.\n\nAt present, there are several ways for foreigners to legally come to the United States to live, either temporarily or permanently. In 2015, for example, the US granted lawful permanent resident status, commonly known as a “green card” to 1,051,031 people. Recipients included winners of the “green card lottery,” also known as the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, which provides a limited number of people from countries with relatively low immigration to the US the ability to come here.\n\nRelated: As AG, Sessions Could Radically Influence Immigration Enforcement\n\nOthers earn the right to live in the US permanently by other means. Relatives of legal residents have a path, often tortuous, to legal status. This is by far the most common method of earning a Green Card, with 63 percent of them issued to relatives of current legal residents each year. Refugees seeking asylum in the US are also eligible for legal resident status.\n\nPeople from other countries can also enter the country on work and student visas. These typically require them to demonstrate that they have either been offered legal employment in the US or that they have been accepted as students in an accredited academic program.\n\nSome of these methods are plainly objectionable to Trump and his administration. Soon after taking office he issued an executive order barring refugees from entering the country. He also objects to allowing the relatives of existing residents an easier path to entry than others.\n\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has also raised questions about allowing skilled immigrants into the country on work and student visas. For example, he said, “You’ve got all the engineering schools full of people from South Asia and East Asia. And it’s not that I have any problem with those folks learning, but they are coming here to take these jobs.”\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump’s New Immigration Orders\n\nSo, it’s unclear exactly what Trump meant when, during his address to a joint session of Congress last week, he spoke in favor of merit-based immigration systems. However, he did offer some clues.\n\n“The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers,” he said. “Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system. It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.”\n\nHe continued, “Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.”\n\nTrump returned to the subject on Friday, reacting to the appearance of author Nick Adams on the television program Fox & Friends. Adams, an Australian by birth who emigrated to the US in 2016, is a rising figure in conservative circles. He founded the hyper-patriotic group Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness (FLAG). In his book, he documents his struggle to obtain a green card, arguing that the US immigration system is biased in favor of illegal immigration.\n\nRelated: Study Finds Illegal Immigrants Pay $11.8B in Taxes\n\nNick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017\n\nTrump’s reference to the systems in place in Canada and Australia suggests the direction he might like to take the US system. In Canada, prospective immigrants face a points-based system for earning the right to enter the country as legal residents.\n\nA 100-point scale accounts for various factors with high levels of education or training in desirable fields weighted heavily. The system also favors people who are fluent in either English or French, the two official languages of the Canadian government. It gives extra points, though fewer of them, to younger immigrants and those with family members already in the country.\n\nAustralia, similarly, focuses its immigration policy strongly on admitting younger, economically independent candidates. The country accepted slightly more than 262,000 new permanent legal residents last year, 57 percent of whom were allowed in because they possessed particular skills or educational credentials. Thirty-four percent were allowed in because of existing family members in the country, while a relative trickle, 9 percent, were allowed in under the country’s humanitarian program.\n\nRelated: Trump Rolls the Dice on Immigration, and It’s Coming Up Snake Eyes\n\n(Australia also has a draconian approach to dealing with illegal immigrants, even those who attempt to enter the country as refugees. Currently, there are thousands of would-be immigrants effectively imprisoned on remote islands in the South Pacific.\n\nWhat exactly Trump would like to transform the US system into remains unclear, but a few things appear certain. He would prefer to limit immigration in ways that privilege the economically independent and make it much harder for poorer, less-educated people to enter the country.\n\nThat would mark a sharp, official break with the United States’ longstanding self-image as a place where people with little opportunity for advancement in their own countries can come to America to seek their fortune. It would also put intense pressure on sectors of the economy -- particularly agriculture -- that rely heavily on immigrant labor.\n\nBut, elected as he was on a promise to greatly limit immigration, both of those seem like prices Trump is more than willing to ask the country to pay."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/05/How-3-GOP-Senators-Could-Stop-Obamacare-Repeal-its-Tracks",
    "text": "Three prominent conservative senators – Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah – have threatened to derail the House approach to repeal and replace Obamacare unless it is radically overhauled. Because the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, those three senators could stop the repeal movement in its tracks.\n\nNot long ago, the only threat to moving ahead with the plan was seen as the possible defection of moderate Republican lawmakers and governors. But now, as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) prepares to push through a budget measure that would repeal much of the Obamacare law and garnish it with elements of a replacement plan, the real threat is coming from the far right.\n\nRelated: Democrats Claim They Can Block Obamacare Repeal by Republicans\n\nWith broad support from outside conservative groups, including Freedom Works, Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action for America, the three senators are taking a hard line. Their plan is similar to a measure passed by the Republicans in January 2016 that gutted every mandate, tax increase and subsidy in the ACA legislation, along with an I.O.U. to come back later with a fully defined Republican alternative. President Obama vetoed the bill, but the Republicans promised to pass it again after the November election.\n\nAnything short of that, the three argue, would be a gross violation of the Republicans’ pledge to the country. Although the 2010 Affordable Care Act subsequently helped insure millions of Americans, President Trump and GOP leaders have denounced it as an abject failure.\n\n“When you spend six years promising, ‘If only we get elected, we’ll repeal Obamacare,’ you cannot renege on that promise,” Cruz said on Friday in an op-ed in Politico. “Failure is not an option. Breaking our word would be a catastrophe. The voters would, quite rightly, never again trust Republicans to deliver on anything.”\n\nPaul and Lee echoed those same sentiments this week. And beyond that is their disdain for the work going on in the House, where Ryan, Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and the top Republicans on the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees are feverishly working behind closed doors to devise a plan they can take to the floor within the next few weeks.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe House Republicans are attempting to fashion a hybrid budget resolution that cherry picks the best of Obamacare – including a ban on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies until age 26 – while scrapping the rest in favor of more conservative, market-oriented measures.\n\nRyan got burned politically when an earlier version of the plan leaked out late last month at the start of a weeklong congressional recess and helped to fuel protests and acrimony at town hall meetings across the country. This time, he is treating the new version like a top secret under lock and key.\n\nPaul mocked Ryan and the other House GOP leaders by presenting himself outside the door of a Capitol conference room on Thursday and demanding to be let inside to read the latest version of the Obamacare repeal legislation. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and other Democrats made a similar show of pique at being denied a peek at the evolving legislation.\n\n“I’d like a copy of the bill,” Paul declared to a House GOP aide who came to the door, and to a group of reporters who gathered at the entrance. “If you’d recall, when Obamacare was passed in 2009 and 2010, [House Democratic Leader] Nancy Pelosi said you’ll know what’s in it after you pass it. The Republican party shouldn’t act the same way.”\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nPaul never made it passed the door, but he and his conservative allies are not likely to approve of whatever eventually emerges from the room. Few details have slipped out so far about the shape of the newly revised GOP health care replacement legislation.\n\nHowever, the House GOP plan is likely to include measures largely endorsed by President Trump in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. Those include interstate sales of health insurance policies; the greatly expanded use of tax-exempt medical savings accounts, creation of “risk pools” in every state to cover older, sicker Americans; changes to Medicaid coverage for the poor and some form of a federal tax credit that would replace the Obamacare tax subsidy that helps people cover their premium costs.\n\nVice President Mike Pence made a joint appearance with Ryan in the speaker’s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, on Friday, where he seemingly embraced Ryan’s approach to health care reform. \"Let me make you a promise: the Obamacare nightmare is about to end,\" Pence declared.\n\nPence said he and Trump were working with Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to “put the finishing touches on our plan, even as this weekend rolls on.”\n\nRyan presented members of the House Republican conference with a timeline for action on Thursday that called for committee action beginning next week and passage of the budget resolution on the floor within three weeks. If they manage to do that, the bill would then go to the Senate for uncertain action. But the question of how best to replace Obamacare’s income tax subsidy for lower income Americans is proving to be one of the biggest stumbling blocks to a compromise among Republicans in both chambers.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nRyan and Tom Price, the former House Republican member and now secretary of health and human services, have long favored a “refundable” tax credit that would be available to all Americans – but one based on age rather than income. Under Obamacare, eligible individuals and families with low or moderate income receive a refundable tax credit to purchase health insurance on government-run exchanges. That means that people who pay little in federal taxes could still qualify for premium support.\n\nPrice, the former House Budget Committee chair, pioneered a substitute fixed refundable tax credit. This one is pegged to a person’s age rather than their income and can be used to buy their insurance policies in the private market. Those tax credits would be fairly modest, ranging from $1,200 a year for people 18 to 35 years of age to $3,000 for those 51 and older. In many regions of the country, that would hardly begin to cover the premiums for a relatively comprehensive health insurance plan. Ryan tweaked that approach by providing a credit of up to $4,000 a year.\n\nBut many conservative Republicans have opposed refundable tax credits of any stripe. That’s because people with lower incomes, who pay less in income taxes, receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. The non-refundable credits may be used only to offset actual tax liability. Some say they oppose the refundable tax credit idea because it is tantamount to a new government entitlement, like Medicare or Medicaid, by allowing Americans to receive a larger credit than they pay in taxes.\n\n\"We are sending federal assistance in a newly created method that somehow we think will work better than what we've had” in Obamacare, Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the Freedom Caucus, said.\n\nRand Paul and Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) have offered an alternative backed by the conservative House Freedom Caucus that provides an individual tax break that can’t result in a refund. But without a refundable credit, low-income people would be left out in the cold."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/03/Here-s-Basic-Problem-Trump-s-Plan-Slash-IRS-Budget",
    "text": "A Trump administration proposal to slash the budget of the beleaguered Internal Revenue Service by more than 14 percent next year has further heightened concerns that the new president’s spending and tax cut strategies will drive the deficit to record levels.\n\nLong under assault by Republican lawmakers, the IRS in recent years has been forced to make significant cutbacks in audits and tax compliance operations, fostering widespread tax cheating and major revenue losses for the U.S. Treasury. Last year, the IRS reported a staggering $458 billion average annual difference between taxes that were owed and actually paid – the so-called “tax gap.”\n\nRelated: IRS Now Pegs Tax Cheating by Americans at $458 Billion Annually\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified during his recent Senate confirmation hearings that one of his goals is to beef up the agency’s enforcement division to vastly improve tax collections and help bring down the deficit. Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen have argued that stepped up enforcement efforts would more than pay for themselves, garnering $6 to $7 of additional tax revenue for every $1 spent uncovering tax non-compliance.\n\nYet the Office of Management and Budget has proposed slashing the IRS budget by 14.1 percent in fiscal 2018, according to The New York Times. That would bring down the agency’s operating budget to just $9.65 billion – a far cry from the $12.1 billion budget just six years ago.\n\nThe IRS is one of many federal agencies and departments that are being targeted for steep cuts next year to help offset the $54 billion of increased spending on the military that President Trump proposed this week. The State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and scores of social programs have also been targeted for cuts in a budget document prepared by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe IRS budget overall has come down by 17 percent since 2010, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That has forced the agency to severely scale back enforcement operations, employee training and badly needed upgrades to information technology systems.\n\nRelated: IRS May Have Allowed Insurers to Escape Millions in Fees and Penalties\n\nThroughout that period, the IRS has reduced its staffing by 14 percent, from 94,600 to 81,600. Some of that reduction was warranted, especially as the tax filing system moved rapidly from the antiquated filing of paper tax returns to almost exclusively on-line or electronic filings.\n\nHowever, some experts say that steady decline in spending on IRS operations and enforcement over the years has resulted in a serious reduction in customer service, the closing of dozens of walk-in assistance centers, a decline in the number of audits to ferret out tax cheating and a gradual erosion in compliance and public confidence in the tax system. The number of IRS staffers devoted to audits and enforcing the tax law has dropped from more than 50,000 to below 39,000 since 2010, or 22 percent.\n\nNew internal data released this week by the IRS Criminal Investigation unit in its annual report show that the number of individual tax return audits fell in 2016 to the lowest level since 2004.\n\nDennis J. Ventry Jr., a member of the IRS advisory council and a law professor at the University of California-Davis, told Times that the agency had already been squeezed dry.\n\nRelated: Why the IRS Is Catching Fewer Tax Cheats\n\nLast year, seven former IRS commissioners wrote a letter to Congress, saying that over the past half century, “none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last five years and the impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.”\n\nAlan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said in an email Friday that even with the advent of automated, computerized tax filings and communications, the IRS still has “too many responsibilities” with a diminished budget, “especially because it has to handle health care and other ancillary objectives.”\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the IRS is responsible for determining whether filers have purchased health insurance, as required by law, and process the applications of lower-income Americans for tax credits to help many cover the cost of their premiums. Under an executive order signed by Trump in late January, however, the IRS has scrapped plans to more aggressively enforce the mandate requiring individuals to show that they have purchased health insurance on their tax returns.\n\nSome economists say that OMB’s latest assault on IRS funding must be viewed in the larger context of the president’s overall plan to slash taxes by trillions of dollars over the coming decade, vastly expand funding for national defense and immigration enforcement and other measures likely to drive up a national debt that is fast approaching $20 trillion.\n\nRelated: IRS Warns That Scammers Have a New Trick to Get Your W-2 Form\n\nRoberton C. Williams, a fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, said in an interview Friday that further cuts in IRS operating funds will only speed up the surge in the deficit.\n\n“The less money you spend on enforcement, the more likely you are to have reduced compliance – and therefore less revenue,” he said. “It feeds on itself. We need the revenue. We have a big budget deficit. If we collected moneys we should be collecting, we would go a long way towards closing that budget deficit. But we’re not doing that.”"

    "text": "It seems that a day doesn’t go by without Donald Trump or one of his associates contradicting themselves about the relationship between his presidential campaign and the Russian government. On Thursday, just hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any investigation of the campaign’s ties to Russia, another Trump adviser revealed that Trump and his team had been more aggressive in inserting Russia-friendly policy planks into the Republican Party platform than they previously admitted.\n\nOver the summer, as the Republicans were preparing to formally nominate Trump as their presidential candidate, controversy broke out over a proposed change to the language in the party’s platform with regard to Ukraine. A member of the platform committee proposed an amendment that expressed support for the provision of lethal weapons to the government in Kiev, which was then fighting a Russia-backed insurgency on the heels of Moscow’s invasion of Crimea.\n\nRelated: Sessions Recusal Replaces One Set of Questions with Another\n\nReports at the time indicated that Trump’s representatives at the meeting moved quickly to water down the language, but the campaign denied it forcefully. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort said on Meet the Press that he didn’t even know there was a debate about it. “I didn’t even hear of it until after our convention was over,” he insisted.\n\nPressed on the matter he added, “It absolutely did not come from the Trump campaign. And I don’t know who everybody is, but I guarantee you it was nobody that was on the platform committee –“\n\n“So nobody from the Trump campaign wanted that change in the platform?” asked host Chuck Todd.\n\n“No one. Zero,” said Manafort.\n\nIn an interview with ABC after the convention, Trump seemed to confirm that he was not party to his campaign’s discussions about the GOP’s position on Ukraine. “I wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.\"\n\nTurns out, though, that not only did someone on the Trump campaign want to soften language toward Russia, but that somebody may have been Donald Trump himself.\n\nAccording to CNN reporter Jim Acosta, former Trump national security adviser J.D. Gordon said on Thursday that last March, at a meeting in Washington months before the Republican convention, Trump said that he “didn’t want to go to World War III over Ukraine” and said that he favored a much lower level of support for the government in Kiev, one that did not involve providing weapons.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nGordon said that he specifically advocated for the change in platform language that was ultimately inserted, and did so because he believed it was what Trump had requested.\n\nAs recently as January, Gordon told Business Insider that Trump and Manafort were not engaged in policy discussions at that level of detail. In an email Friday, he told the website that he did not see his comments as contradictory, and that the apparent disconnect between his January statements and CNN’s report was a matter of “semantics.”\n\nThe CNN story comes on the heels of fresh reports of meetings between Trump associates, including Gordon, and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Gordon and Trump advisers Carter Page and Walid Phares reportedly met with Kislyak during the Republican convention at an event in Cleveland. In addition, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Kislyak in Trump Tower in December.\n\nFlynn later resigned his position with the White House after lying to others in the administration about the extent of his contacts with Kislyak.\n\nTo be clear, there is nothing necessarily wrong about any of the meetings or contacts that Trump associates have had with the Russian ambassador. Flynn might have crossed a line if he interfered with the Obama administration’s efforts to conduct foreign policy before Trump was sworn in. But for the most part, the meetings with Kislyak could easily be dismissed as business-as-usual interactions between foreign policy advisers and professional diplomats.\n\nRelated: Trump Has a New Reason for His Military Buildup: Job Creation\n\nWhat makes the matter so puzzling, and to some minds even troubling, is apparent resistance among members of the Trump administration to come clean about the frequency and content of their discussions with Russia and their efforts to promote policy positions friendly to the Kremlin.\n\nIf nothing else, it’s providing a source of free and seemingly unlimited ammunition to the administration’s critics. Being vague or untruthful about Russia has already cost the administration one National Security Adviser, and now Democrats are calling for the resignation of Attorney General Sessions. Much more of this and it could become a distraction so overwhelming that it inhibits the administration’s ability to effectively govern."

The individuals used personal information from 2,800 unwitting taxpayers to file 1,466 phony returns to get the refunds.\n\nA pair of tax preparers in Atlanta will spend more than six years behind bars following a March 2016 conviction for creating fake, unprofitable businesses to get fraudulent deductions on their clients’ tax returns. The scheme cost the IRS $3.5 million.\n\nA North Carolina man who ran a third-party payroll service was found guilty of stealing money intended to pay for payroll and employment tax on behalf of clients. Instead, he used at least $3.7 million for alcohol, strip club entertainment, jewelry, a Mercedes Benz and a luxury home.\n\nRelated: IRS Warns That Scammers Have a New Trick to Get Your W-2 Form\n\nThese cases represent just a few of the tax criminals the IRS Criminal Investigation sought to bring to justice in its fiscal 2016, according to its annual report released this week. The agency says it started 3,395 investigations, recommended 2,744 prosecutions and saw 2,699 tax crooks sentenced to federal prison, a halfway house, home detention or some combination of those.\n\nAcross the board, though, those totals are down from recent years, with new investigations falling by almost 12 percent from 2015, 21 percent from 2014 and by a third since 2013, when 5,314 investigations were initiated.\n\nThe agency says that’s largely because it has had to reduce staff in response to budget cuts going back to 2010. The number of special agents and professional staff fell 4.3 percent and 3.3 percent year over year, respectively, and has decreased by 19.1 percent and 21.7 percent in the past five years. Now, President Trump wants to further cut the IRS’s funding, according to the White House budget outline released this week (though Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has called for increases to IRS funding and staffing).\n\nTo compensate for the recent cuts, the IRS focuses on opening only the highest priority cases with the biggest impact on tax administration. Those include:\n\nNarcotics (which accounted for 23.2 percent of all new cases)\n\nIdentity theft (16.9 percent)\n\nQuestionable returns (14.6 percent)\n\nAbusive return preparer (7.4 percent)\n\nInternational operations (6.5 percent)\n\nEmployment tax (4 percent)\n\nPublic corruption (2.5 percent)\n\nAbusive tax schemes (1.6 percent)\n\nTerrorism (1.2 percent)\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Treasury Pick Wants to Increase the Power of the IRS\n\n“While the number of cases we open each year is directly impacted by the size of our organization, the quality and the impact of those cases is significant,” the agency said in the annual report from its Criminal Investigation unit. “Tax prosecutions directly impact voluntary compliance via criminal deterrence and are a critical component of a strong tax system.”"

Neither meeting was private. One was at a conference held by the Heritage Foundation with a large group of people. The second was with two members of his staff present.\n\nSessions announced that he would recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into connections between President Donald Trump’s campaign staff and the Russian government, which the US Intelligence Community has accused of interfering in the election on Trump’s behalf.\n\nSessions claimed, in effect, that he had misunderstood a question posed by Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) during his confirmation hearing. Asked whether he knew of any contact between Trump campaign officials, of which he was one, and figures in the Russian government, he said that he did not, adding, “I did not have communications with the Russians.”\n\nRelated: Kremlin: Ambassador Didn’t Meet Sessions (But It Would Have Been OK If He Did)\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions said that he had understood the question to be about whether he had had discussions about the election with Russian officials, which he says he did not. “In retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times, and that would be the ambassador,” he explained during his press conference.\n\nSessions’ announcement that he would recuse himself was plainly meant to defuse a controversy that looked increasingly dangerous for the Trump administration, but in several ways, all it did was to refocus the questions that will be brought up by political opponents and even concerned allies.\n\nSessions is still in charge.\n\nThe fact that he has recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged connections to the Kremlin won’t come close to satisfying Democrats who remain furious at the possibility that Russian interference may have cost Democrat Hillary Clinton the presidency.\n\nThe job of overseeing the investigation and making the difficult calls associated with it, such as whom to subpoena and whether or not any charges should ultimately be brought will fall to the deputy attorney general, who works for...Jeff Sessions. The job is currently filled on an interim basis by Dana J. Boente, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, pending the confirmation of Rod J. Rosenstein, the United States attorney for Maryland.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nWhile both Boente and Rosenstein are respected professionals, the fact that they answer to Sessions in all areas except one will undoubtedly rub many Democrats the wrong way. Among them, no doubt, will be Nancy Pelosi, who this week accused Sessions of lying to Congress and demanded that he resign.\n\nJames Comey is still in the mix.\n\nDemocrats have been loudly demanding that the investigation of the alleged Trump-Russia connection be put in the hands of someone independent of the power structure in the Justice Department, and their concern extends well beyond Sessions and his deputy. The on-the-ground element of the investigation is being spearheaded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its director, James Comey.\n\nMany Democrats have come to harbor serious distrust of Comey because of actions his agency took during the presidential election. Leaks from the FBI to major media outlets late last year seemed designed to shoot down the idea that there was a significant investigation into a Trump-Russia connection under way. At the same time, FBI agents were feeding information damaging to Clinton to Trump surrogate and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWhen, less than two weeks before the election, Comey went public with the news that the FBI was investigating a possible security breach connected with Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, only to report days later that nothing new had been discovered, Democrats accused him of aiding the Trump campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump Has a New Reason for His Military Buildup: Job Creation\n\nMore Russian contacts keep emerging.\n\nEven as Sessions was speaking to the press Thursday, new reports were emerging of other contacts between officials in the Trump campaign and Russian Ambassador Kislyak. The New York Times on Thursday reported that in December, prior to Trump taking office, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner met with Kislyak in Trump Tower. That 15-minute meeting was considered a typical formality since members of the new administration-elect to meet were being introduced to ambassadors of many countries at that point.\n\nAlso on Thursday USA Today reported that two Trump campaign officials, J.D. Gordon and Carter Page, met with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in July, just as news about alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election was breaking.\n\nTo be clear, neither of these meetings was necessarily nefarious. The Trump Tower gathering was supposedly meant simply to open lines of communication, while the Sessions meeting in July appears to have been part of a reception surrounding the convention. But they contribute to the impression that connections between the Kremlin and Trump’s campaign team ran deeper than advertised.\n\nIn the end, Sessions’ recusal isn’t going to make any of these issues go away. He didn’t help matters last night when, in an appearance on Fox News, he appeared to express doubt about whether or not Russia had even tried to interfere in the election at all.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Be So Worried About the Trade Deficit\n\nHost Tucker Carlson asked, “Did the campaign believe that the Russian government, the Putin government, favored Trump over Clinton in this race?”\n\n“I have never been told that,” Sessions said.\n\n“Do you think they did?” Carlson said.\n\n“I don’t have any idea, Tucker, you’d have to ask them,” Sessions replied.\n\nThat contradicts the findings of the Intelligence Community, including the FBI, which Sessions oversees as Attorney General."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/03/New-EPA-Chief-Scott-Pruitt-Balking-Trump-s-Big-Budget-Cuts",
    "text": "It was no surprise that former Environmental Protection Agency director Gina McCarthy reacted with shock and outrage to reports that the Trump administration budget office had proposed slashing her former agency’s budget by 25 per cent, jettisoning scores of vital environmental quality programs and climate change research in the process.\n\n“I think people have to realize that this budget proposal that is being put on the table would take staffing levels at EPA down to where they were 40 years ago,” she said Wednesday on MSNBC. “This is really not about [Trump administration disagreement] on climate anymore. This is an attack on the agency.”\n\nRelated: A Plan to Drastically Cut EPA Staff and Programs Is on Trump’s Desk\n\nMore remarkable was the response of Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general and long-time foe of EPA policies who was brought in by President Trump to run the EPA and preside over the dismantling of many of its most controversial programs, especially those designed to reduce industrial carbon emissions that directly contribute to global warming.\n\nThe night of President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, during which the new president pledged to protect the quality of air and water, Pruitt told a reporter for E&E News that he had already raised concerns about the billions of cuts with Mick Mulvaney, the new Office of Management and Budget director and former Tea Party conservative House member from South Carolina.\n\n\"I am concerned about the grants that have been targeted, particularly around water infrastructure, and those very important state revolving funds,\" Pruitt told the reporter. \"The importance is setting priorities as an agency and then allowing the budget to be formed around that. What's difficult, having only been there a week, is to have these kinds of recommendations made and then look at our priorities and say, 'You know what, we've got to make sure that we look at these programs.'\"\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nAs state attorney general, Pruitt was closely aligned with the oil and gas industry and sued the EPA at least 14 times in recent years, challenging the agencies legal authority to regulate mercury pollution, smog and carbon emissions. A cache of 6,000 emails released last week as part of a law suit in Oklahoma showed that Pruitt carefully coordinated his efforts to thwart the Obama administration’s climate change initiatives with high level energy and utility company officials. In some cases, industry lawyers drafted letters for him to send to federal regulators.\n\nPruitt said during his Senate confirmation hearings that he did not believe climate change was a \"hoax,” as Trump once insisted. However, he did argue that climate change needed more study and more debate, despite the huge body of existing research linking greenhouse gas emissions to global warming and rising sea levels.\n\nPruitt narrowly won Senate confirmation after his critics said his appointment to the EPA was tantamount to putting the fox in charge of guarding the hen house. Yet now, barely a week into his tenure as the new EPA administrator, he is bridling against the budget cuts. He complained that they would wreak havoc with grants to states, multi-state air quality improvement efforts, and the cleanup of toxic Superfund and abandoned industrial brownfield sites.\n\nHe stepped up his complaints on Thursday, during a gathering of the nation’s mayors in Washington, signaling his intention to fight many of the proposed cuts.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\n“I want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program, water infrastructure … are essential to protect,” Pruitt said.\n\nThe EPA, the State Department and a handful of other agencies have been targeted by the administration for steep cuts to help offset the cost of a $54 billion increase in defense spending and a military buildup ordered by Trump.\n\nAlthough the EPA has operated under budget constraints for years, OMB’s proposal to slash the annual budget from $8.2 billion to $6.1 billion next year – a 25 percent reduction – would constitute an unprecedented assault on the premier environmental protection agency that has operated or the past half century.\n\nTrump, a climate change skeptic, has vowed to get rid of the EPA “in almost every form.” The administration and its GOP allies on Capitol Hill have already begun the process of overturning many of the Obama administration environmental regulations they claim have deterred energy exploration and economic expansion\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump’s plan would slash the EPA’s staff from its current level of 15,000 to 12,000, with many of the agency’s top scientists slated for eventual termination. Grants to states, along with air and water programs, would be cut by 30 percent. A massive cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay would receive just $5 million in the coming fiscal year, down from $73 million.\n\nThe EPA’s Office of Research and Development potentially could lose up to 42 percent of its funding. And the new budget plan would eliminate funding completely for that office’s contribution to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, an important climate change initiative launched in 1989 by former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n“This is going to the heart of our air and water protection,” McCarthy said of the proposed budget cuts in an interview on MSNBC. “This is going to the heart of how EPA protects public health and American families, so that you can turn you tap water on and expect to have clean drinking water. So that we can deal with kids who have asthma attacks and provide cleaner air for them.”\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that Pruitt in the end will be anything other than a team player in trying to implement the cuts that Trump and Mulvaney are trying to implement. But still, it’s possible that now that he is ensconced as administrator learning first-hand the challenges and responsibilities of the EPA, Pruitt could be taking a more nuanced approach to overhauling and downsizing the agency.\n\n“It remains to be seen how much he has actually changed,” said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “How much of this is a combination of the turf protection that hits and getting yourself into the culture of an agency? Or maybe it’s a sharper understanding that the cuts that they’re going to make are actually going to hit places like Oklahoma hard, because a lot of that money goes for cleaning up toxic sites and other kinds of things that are right in their wheelhouse.”\n\n“They don’t mind creating the toxic sites, but they want somebody else to pay for cleaning them up,” he added. Oklahoma currently has seven Superfund sites, with most of them at abandoned oil refineries.\n\nWhat’s more, Congress will have the final say in how deeply to cut EPA programs. The early indication is that Democrats and some Republicans are opposed to taking a meat axe to the agency’s budget.\n\nAlthough the Republicans have frequently extracted cuts in EPA programs, many Republicans have refused to go along with massive, one-time cuts in spending, according to The Hill. Indeed, 56 House Republicans voted against a floor amendment to cut the agency’s budget by 17 percent.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said on Tuesday that he thought Trump’s overall budget proposals would be “dead on arrival” in Congress. And Rep. Tom Cole (R-Ok), a veteran GOP strategist and House Appropriations Committee member, said, “I’d like to look and see what actually gets out of committee.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/02/Trump-Has-New-Reason-His-Military-Buildup-Job-Creation",
    "text": "In his promises to greatly ramp up spending on the U.S. military, president Donald Trump has generally cast the additional spending as being essential to national security, and therefore in need of little additional justification. But on Thursday, during a speech in Newport News, Virginia, Trump added a new wrinkle, suggesting that his plans will amount to a national jobs program.\n\n“This great rebuilding effort will create many jobs in Virginia and across America, and it will also spur new technology and new innovation. America has always been the country that boldly leads the world into the future and my budget will assure we do so and continue to do exactly that.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Naval Buildup Could Cost $750 Billion Over 30 Years\n\nTrump delivered his brief remarks on board the USS Gerald R. Ford, the first of a new class of aircraft carriers that he said stands as “a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace.”\n\nThe ship, he added, will “project American power in distant lands ... Hopefully, it’s power we don’t have to use, but if we do they’re in big, big trouble.”\n\nHe said that the Ford and other planned carriers in production will bring the Navy up to the 12-carrier force the Pentagon wants, and were part of a massive investment that would see the total number of ships in the Navy rise to the highest level ever.\n\nThe drive to beef up the Navy is only part of what Trump described as the “great rebuilding of American military might.” The administration has already indicated that it will seek an additional $54 billion in annual funding for the Pentagon in next year’s budget, a 10 percent increase that would require Congress to do away with the sequester, which was supposed to impose spending cuts on the military every year for a decade.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\nTrump’s message about jobs and military spending probably won’t get the attention the administration hoped, given the circumstances under which it was delivered. As Trump made his way through the belly of the giant ship prior to the speech, he was pressed by repeated calls from reporters to comment on reports that his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, misled Congress during his confirmation hearing in January.\n\nSessions had been asked whether he had any contact with the Russian government during the election, and replied that he had not. It was revealed Wednesday night that in fact he met twice with the Russian ambassador.\n\nWhile that would normally not be remarkable, the meetings came as U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating what they described as Russian interference in the presidential campaign, mainly in the form of hacking email accounts of Democrats. At the time of the meetings, Sessions was a senior member of the Trump campaign organization.\n\nDemocrats and many Republicans have said that Sessions at least should recuse himself from overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the election. Some Democrats have called for his outright resignation.\n\nRelated: The Staggering Costs of Operating Air Force One\n\nAfter saying earlier that he has “total confidence” in Sessions, Trump was asked while on the Ford whether he believed that Sessions had testified truthfully. “I think he probably did,” Trump said. When a reporter followed up by asking him if he feels Sessions should recuse himself, Trump replied, “I don’t think so.”\n\nThe president also appeared to say that he had not known about Sessions’ meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kilyak. That would jibe with accounts coming from reporters in the White House, who say administration officials learned about Sessions’ talks with the Russians from a Washington Post report."

    "text": "Stocks are taking a breather Wednesday after reaching record highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 300 points to cross the 21,000 level for the first time ever on Wednesday, roaring back from a minuscule decline the day before that broke a record 12-in-a-row win streak.\n\nThe exuberance has been thick in the air, with stock prices climbing despite political uncertainty, extended valuations and narrow breadth. Sentiment reached extreme levels. It's incredible to see. But it also sets the stage for some serious disappointment from higher interest rates. Perhaps as soon as two weeks from now.\n\nRelated: Dow at 21,000 — but Many Stocks Are Getting Left Behind\n\nI know it's probably sacrilegious to say this aloud right now, but all recent bull markets (and economic expansions) have been killed by the Federal Reserve. The current uptrend and expansion will no doubt end with a similar fate: Undone by higher credit costs.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, after some very hawkish commentary from three separate Federal Reserve officials, futures markets odds of another quarter-point rate hike at the March policy meeting surged above 70 percent. They moved above 80 percent on Wednesday, up from 31 percent on Monday. Market expectations for interest rates have now crossed the unofficial threshold that has presaged the last two rate hikes in this tightening cycle, in December 2015 and December 2016, as shown below. The March policy meeting is very much in play.\n\nOn Tuesday, Philly Fed president Patrick Harker, speaking at Temple University, reiterated his comments from Feb. 15 that not only is the economy firming up but that he sees three quarter-point rate hikes as appropriate this year.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?\n\nThis was followed by comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams, speaking in Santa Cruz, where he said the economy is \"too hot\" and that a March rate hike is \"very much on the table for serious consideration.\" He added that \"right now interest rates are abnormally low.\"\n\nFinally, New York Fed President Bill Dudley told CNN in an interview that the case for further policy tightening had become a \"lot more compelling.\"\n\nThe hawkishness continued on Wednesday, with Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan saying policymakers should be in the process of removing accommodation and that new rate hikes may be needed in the \"near future.\"\n\nStocks have yet to fully react to these headlines, which in years past would've rattled stimulus-addicted traders to the core. But these days, attention has moved from the Fed's machinations to what President Trump will do on deregulation, taxes and stimulus spending.\n\nRelated: Republican Hopes for Tax Reform Hinge on a Trillion-Dollar Gimmick\n\nYet let's not forget: With the national debt swelling toward $20 trillion, and with corporate profitability growth tepid, a more aggressive pace of Fed rate hikes will not only pressure the U.S. budget deficit by raising the government’s interest costs but it will undermine U.S. equity valuations as well. Higher interest rates — while a positive for banks — act like a wet blanket on the rest of the economy (as monetary policy tightening intends). As rates rise, they will weigh on consumer confidence, credit availability and corporate expenditures.\n\nAnd they will make stocks relatively less attractive, since higher interest rates reduce the value of future earnings.\n\nThere is also a political element in all this as well: Trump criticized Fed Chair Janet Yellen on the campaign trail for holding interest rates artificially low to boost the stock market for the Democrats and President Obama. Should the Fed hike again in March, following a hike in December, and signal two further hikes in 2017, it will surely attract Trump's ire.\n\nWall Street is unlikely to be pleased with a casting of the Federal Reserve as a political entity. But recent Fed history could feed into Trump's argument, especially when one considers the chart above from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showing massive policy accommodation was afforded to President Obama during his eight years in office (which, admittedly, began in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression).\n\nRelated: The Federal Reserve Bank, Explained\n\nIn one clear sign the stock market's post-election dynamic is changing, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" pushed above its upper Bollinger Band (a measure of volatility and trend) for the first time since late October on Tuesday.\n\nPut simply: With the Fed's March 15 policy meeting fast approaching, many market insiders are bracing for a return of weakness and volatility. Keep an eye on Yellen, who will be speaking on Chicago on Friday and could use the opportunity to lean against the mania in stocks."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/02/Are-Patient-Advocacy-Groups-Influenced-Drug-Companies",
    "text": "Much has been made about the often cozy relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and doctors who are hired to research and vouch for expensive new brand name drugs.\n\nLast year, a study by the independent publication ProPublica revealed that physicians who receive payments from major drug and medical device manufacturers were far more inclined to prescribe brand name medications than doctors who don’t accept payments, gifts or other honoraria. A subsequent study published by JAMA Internal Medicine made the astounding finding that U.S. doctors who received a single meal from a pharmaceutical company were more likely to prescribe that company’s newer, costlier drugs than would other doctors.\n\nRelated: Can Big Pharma Actually Buy a Doctor’s Allegiance for a $20 Meal?\n\nWhile few would suggest that a reputable physician would intentionally prescribe a costlier prescription drug for patients than was needed in exchange for a free lunch from Big PhRMA, the research raised important questions about how money can consciously or subconsciously sway the judgment of professional health care providers.\n\nNow a new study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine is raising similar ethical questions about whether the nation’s largest patient advocates have come under the sway of the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry. Eighty-three percent or more of the nation’s 104 largest patient advocacy groups accepted substantial contributions from the drug, medical device, and biotech industries in 2014, according to the new findings.\n\nThese high-profile advocacy groups promote research and development of new drugs for the treatment of cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, HIV and other serious diseases. Ostensibly, they are also attempting to influence the drug industry to make prices more affordable. Most of these groups accept funding from major pharmaceutical companies, and many fail to report any of those contributions.\n\nRelated: Doctors Who Take Money from Drug Companies Prescribe More Expensive Drugs\n\nThe study highlights the dilemma for many of these groups, which each reported receiving more than $7.5 million in annual revenues during 2014. While these groups are campaigning and lobbying for the most effective and least costly care for the patients they represent, most of them couldn’t effectively function without some financial assistance from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe National Hemophilia Foundation, for instance, received somewhere between $8.5 million and $14 million of the group’s $16.8 million annual budget from corporate donors in 2014, according to the study, while the American Diabetes Association disclosed receiving more than $28 million in drug industry funding in 2014 – or roughly 15 percent of its budget.\n\nYet by accepting millions of dollars from the drug industry, officials of these and other advocacy groups may feel compelled to soften or carefully tailor their positions on drug pricing and marketing practices or the need for faster Food and Drug Administration approval of new drugs to avoid offending their drug industry benefactors. Moreover, in nearly 40 percent of the cases studied, drug industry executives actually sat on the governing boards of the advocacy groups, helping to shape the groups’ policies.\n\nRelated: How Drug Companies Are Scrambling to Respond to Pressure Over Soaring Prices\n\nMatthew McCoy of the University of Pennsylvania’s Department of Medical Ethics and the primary author of the study told Kaiser Health News that patient advocates have an inherent conflict of interest in lobbying policy makers without disclosing the financial assistance they are receiving from the drug industry. “The ‘patient’ voice is speaking with a PhRMA accent,” he said.\n\n\n\nHolly Campbell, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the principal drug industry trade organization, said its members did not expect patient groups to agree with them on every issue. “We work with many organizations with which we have disagreements on public policy issues, including on prescription medicine costs, but believe engagement and dialogue are critical,” she said."

    "text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior officials of the Trump administration aren’t the only ones struggling to come up with a coherent explanation for why Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak last September and then failed to acknowledge the meeting when asked about contacts with Russian officials in testimony given to a Senate committee under oath.\n\nThe Kremlin, too, is throwing off spin and misdirection at a pretty impressive pace, suggesting that Vladimir Putin’s government is concerned about suggestions of collusion between its intelligence services and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nRelated: Demands for a Special Counsel to Investigate Trump’s Russia Ties Just Got Louder\n\n“The embassy doesn’t comment on numerous contacts with local partners, which occur on a daily basis in line with diplomatic practice,” the Russian Embassy said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Russian state-run media was painting a different picture Thursday. The RT network, which played its own small part in the Trump-Russia drama by paying former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to attend a gala with Putin in Russia two years ago, reported that the Kremlin denies that Kislyak and Sessions ever met at all even as Putin’s top spokesman said that such meetings wouldn’t be strange at all.\n\n“The Kremlin...ruled out any possibility that contacts between Sessions and the Russian embassy could have taken place,” RT reported. On Thursday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said he is unaware of any such talks between Sessions and Kislyak, adding that establishing working contacts with host nation’s executive and legislative branches is an inherent part of an ambassador’s job.”\n\nThe publication quoted Peskov as adding, “The more such meetings are being held by an ambassador, the more efficient he is. And this applies to every ambassador,” and pointing out that US Ambassador to Russia John Tefft “has plenty of contacts with Russian MPs, and it is quite normal.”\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nFurther, the Kremlin pushed back against the suggestion that Kislyak might have served as a conduit of information between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence services, making the hard-to-credit claim that Russia’s ambassador to the United States has no “links” to his country’s intelligence service.\n\nAccording to the state-run TASS news service, Peskov said that no US intelligence services had accused Kislyak of being a spy. “[The] Kremlin proceeds from the understanding that no US officials have made any claims to the effect the Russian ambassador in Washington, Sergey Kislyak, may have intelligence links and that all media rumors to this effect are baseless and unconfirmed.”\n\n“The only piece of advice that I can give is that in a situation like this, avoid reacting to all such anonymous, baseless fake news stories and rely only on official statements by genuine officials,” TASS quoted Peskov as saying.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson also urged everyone to calm down, saying the discussion has become too emotional. \"We see a highly emotional atmosphere. But before making any evaluations, we should wait for everyone to calm down and the situation to stabilize.”"

    "text": "The odds of a Special Counsel being appointed to investigate the alleged ties between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian intelligence services just improved dramatically, with the revelation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions apparently misled the Senate Judiciary Committee over his contacts with the Russian government during his confirmation hearing.\n\nThe Trump White House got less than twenty-four hours to bask in the warmth of a better-than-expected response to the president’s first address to a joint session of Congress before it was plunged back into the storm of controversy that has marked the opening weeks of the new administration. A report about the inconsistency in Sessions’ testimony was published in The Washington Post Wednesday night and quickly confirmed by other news outlets.\n\nRelated: Your Guide to the Players in the Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nThe Post reported that Sessions met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year, despite having plainly told the Senate Judiciary Committee otherwise. Asked about the swirling allegations that Trump campaign officials had been in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officers Sessions said, “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have—did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.”\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed that the two meetings -- one at an event during the Republican National Convention in July, and the other a private meeting in Sessions’ office in September -- did happen. However, they insisted that not only had nothing improper taken place but that Sessions had not actually misled Congress because he was answering the question about his activities as a member of Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\n“There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,” said Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores. Sessions met Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she explained.\n\nFor his part, Sessions said in a statement, “I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nOn its face, there is nothing improper about a sitting senator meeting with an ambassador from Russia or any other country. In fact, as Flores pointed out in a statement, Sessions met with 25 separate ambassadors at various points in 2016.\n\nHowever, his private meeting with Kislyak took place in September, after the US Intelligence Community publicly declared that they believed Russian intelligence was behind the hacking of email accounts belonging to the Democratic National Committee and to officials associated with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Intelligence officials would only later come to believe that the Russian interference had been intended to help Trump and harm Clinton.\n\nAt the time of their second meeting, Sessions had been very publicly associated with the Trump campaign for many months.\n\nReports of Sessions’ meeting with Kislyak greatly amplified the already-loud calls for the Attorney General to recuse himself from overseeing the ongoing investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nThe Justice Department’s own rules require the Attorney General to recuse himself from cases in which a real or perceived conflict of interest might make the impartiality of an investigation appear compromised. Up to this point, Sessions had declined to do so, and there are no official means of compelling him to step away short of impeachment.\n\nDemocrats have also raised concerns about the impartiality of the inquiry because at the ground level, the investigation is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose director, James Comey, threw the presidential election into further turmoil by announcing an extension of an investigation into Clinton’s use of personal email while Secretary of State just days before voters went to the polls.\n\nThe most recent revelation are already driving calls for Sessions to appoint a Special Counsel to oversee the investigation.\n\nUnder the US Code, the Attorney General may appoint a special prosecutor “when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and that investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and that under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.”\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s ‘Historic’ $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nSessions, again, is under no clear legal obligation to hand off the investigation to a Special Counsel, but the drumbeat of calls for him to do so is only growing louder. Last week, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said he believed such a move was already plainly necessary. On Wednesday night, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) suggested that one might be necessary as well.\n\nThe calls were, naturally, louder from the Democratic side.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Al Franken, who had questioned Sessions about Russia during his confirmation hearing, said in a statement, “It’s clearer than ever now that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement “Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate.” Noting that he had been testifying under penalty of perjury, she called him unfit to serve as Attorney General and demanded his resignation.\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said, “There is no longer any question that we need a truly independent commission to investigate this issue.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nThe White House waved off the Democrats’ fury, characterizing it as politically motivated.\n\n“This is the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats,” a White House official said in a statement. Calling Sessions’ meetings with Kislyak “entirely consistent” with his job as a senator, the statement added, “It is no surprise Senator Al Franken is pushing this story immediately following President Trump’s successful address to the nation.”\n\nUPDATE: As of early Thursday morning, the chorus of lawmakers calling for Sessions to at least recuse himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign's Russia ties had grown to include senior Republicans.\n\nJason Chafftez, the Utah Republican who runs the House Oversight Committee, called on Sessions to \"clarify his testimony and recuse himself.\"\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman said, \"Jeff Sessions is a former colleague and a friend, but I think it would be best for him and for the country to recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it would be \"easier\" for all concerned if Sessions agreed to step back from the investigation. \"I think the trust of the American people -- you recuse yourself in these situations, yes.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/02/Trump-Could-Face-His-First-Fiscal-Crisis-Over-Raising-Debt-Ceiling",
    "text": "President Trump had plenty to say Tuesday night before Congress about increased spending on defense, new infrastructure, a $23 billion wall along the southern border with Mexico and billions of dollars more for steep tax cuts – but nary a word about the looming $20 trillion national debt.\n\nAfter frequent references to the historic flow of government red ink throughout his campaign, Trump was stone silent yesterday on the challenges of slowing the growth of publicly held debt, which currently is on track to grow to 77 percent of the overall economy by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\n“That’s pretty remarkable,” said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit watchdog. “He should have at least teed up the problem and talked about the need for hard choices and bipartisan negotiations . . . and how he wants to put the nation in a better fiscal position.”\n\nThere are any number of reasons Trump may have decided to duck the subject of the debt, including a reluctance to have to explain to conservatives his campaign pledge not to cut Social Security and Medicare, the two premier federal entitlements that are the primary drivers of the long-term debt.\n\nYet a debate over entitlements and the long term debt will be unavoidable this year, especially when the government begins bumping up against its limit on borrowing to cover revenue shortages and must raise the debt ceiling or suffer the consequences of a first-ever default by the Treasury.\n\nRaising the debt ceiling has always been a politically onerous task because neither party wants to be perceived by voters as accommodating runaway government spending. New debt ceiling authority almost always is decided in tandem with other major spending and tax disputes. And the party in power frequently must make concessions to the minority in order to corral enough votes to pass the debt ceiling legislation in the two chambers.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s ‘Historic’ $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher: Failure to raise the debt ceiling would do irreversible damage to the U.S. credit rating, trigger an uproar in U.S. and global markets, drive up the future cost of borrowing, postpone Social Security payments and tax returns, and force layoffs of non-essential government workers.\n\n“It would be the kind of damaging blow to the U.S. economy that might not be correctible for a decade,” said Stan Collender, an authority on the federal budget and an economics blogger for Forbes. “After 250 years of the U.S. history, making interest payments on the debt was never a question. It would now be something that was at least in the back of the minds of all U.S. creditors.”\n\nThe Obama administration had several near misses on raising the debt ceiling during its stormy relations with congressional Republicans. In August 2011, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the government’s Triple-A rating after Congress and the White House deadlocked for weeks over a budget deal, and the Treasury came within an eyelash of defaulting. It took the intervention of Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, two long-time friends, to save the day and avert an economic crisis.\n\nIn 2015, President Obama and Republican congressional leaders agreed to suspend the federal debt ceiling until March 15, 2017. After that date – barely two weeks from now – the Treasury will surpass its cumulative $20 trillion borrowing authority.\n\nAt that point, newly ensconced Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to order “emergency measures” to effectively buy more time for the government to pay its creditors and cover revenue shortfalls to keep the government operating.\n\nRelated: Debt Ceiling: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?\n\nIn the past, those emergency maneuvers have included delaying the reinvestment of assets in the Federal Employees’ Retirement System G-Fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the civil service and postal retirement fund. By postponing those reinvestments, the Treasury slows the growth of its overall debt, or at least on paper.\n\nThose steps would likely enable the Treasury to continue making all payments until at least mid-August, but it's unclear what would happen beyond then, according to Shai Akabas, the director of fiscal policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and an expert on the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Trump administration and GOP leaders have yet to reveal their strategy for averting a debt ceiling crisis this summer, and it’s far from clear whether Senate and House Democrats will agree to cooperate or find ways to put up obstacles to increasing the Treasury’s borrowing authority.\n\nTrump raised plenty of eyebrows during the campaign by lightly dismissing the importance of the debt ceiling. He suggested that if push came to shove, he would negotiate down the debt with the country’s biggest creditors, who include China and Japan.\n\nFormer Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, has long been a skeptic of the dangers of the Treasury defaulting on some of its debt.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Says He Takes the Debt Ceiling More Seriously Than Trump\n\nHe said during his Senate confirmation hearing that while defaulting on America’s debts would have grave worldwide economic consequences, “I do not believe that breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to that result.” That’s because Mulvaney and other conservatives contend that the government can “prioritize” its payments, with the biggest and most important creditor getting paid first while others would have to wait.\n\nHowever, Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker and billionaire hedge fund manager, doused the concerns of lawmakers that Trump and Mulvaney might play games with the debt during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in January.\n\nIt was then that Mnuchin told Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) that he agreed “100 percent” that Trump must never again question America’s willingness to stand by its debt obligation."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/03/02/Why-Trump-Won-t-Touch-Entitlement-Reform-Yet",
    "text": "Will the White House bend to fiscal conservatives on entitlement reform? Their policy preferences say no, but their choices – and House Speaker Paul Ryan – hint at a yes … eventually. The crossed signals on this key issue portend a bumpy ride between now and the midterm elections.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump offered a clear answer about his goals when it came to the federal budget. He wanted more money for the military and homeland security, especially immigration enforcement, and less spending on most other domestic policy areas. Trump made clear that he had no interest in tinkering with Medicare and Social Security, retirement programs on which his working-class base have staked their own futures. In fact, Trump made that clear from the start of his presidential primary campaign in May 2015, in an interview with CBN News’ David Brody.\n\nRelated: Here’s a First Draft of the GOP’s Plan to Overhaul Social Security\n\n“I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican,” Trump declared, “and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.” Trump used that pledge to differentiate himself from the fiscally conservative GOP presidential field, all of whom cited the national debt and the coming crisis of tens of trillions in unfunded entitlement mandates as a need to act now. “Every other Republican’s going to cut,” Trump explained, “and even if they wouldn’t, they don’t know what to do, because they don’t know where the money is. I do.”\n\nBrody pointed out on Monday that the new budget proposal from the White House, as well as remarks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, shows that Trump plans to keep that promise. “Indeed, in a newly published blueprint of the budget that is set to hit government agencies Monday,” Brody writes, “there are no cuts at all to those programs.”\n\nHowever, that message got muddied a bit on the same day. Newly confirmed budget director Mick Mulvaney, previously a fiscal conservative in the House of Representatives, briefed reporters on the White House budget proposal, emphasizing that it only contained “toplines” for each agency and entirely focused on discretionary spending. “So you're not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan,” Mulvaney explained.\n\nRelated: Americans Are More Willing to Cut Social Security Than Once Thought\n\nAt the mention of entitlement reform, reporters pounced. “Why not address entitlements,” one asked, “which is the biggest driver of spending?” When Mulvaney noted that “skinny” budget plans rarely addressed “larger policy decisions,” the reporter wondered whether “down the line, could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlements?”\n\nPress secretary Sean Spicer had to shoot down the speculation later in the briefing, noting twice that Trump had promised to leave Medicare and Social Security alone. “And so he’s going to keep his word to the American people.”\n\nPaul Ryan didn’t quite buy it. In an interview Tuesday with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show, Ryan said entitlement reform was inevitable – and Trump knows it. “Can he balance the budget without it?” Lauer asked. Ryan replied, “We have to reform them for the next generation,” at which Lauer pressed, “But does the President agree with that?” Ryan responded, “I believe he does.”\n\nAt the very least, someone’s confused. And that confusion could set up false expectations that will only deepen some bitterness within the Republican coalition, unless all members of leadership get on the same page, and focus on what’s possible rather than what isn’t.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Promises No Budget Cuts to Social Security and Medicare\n\nNothing has changed politically on this question since the election, except for the demonstration by Trump about the importance of sticking to his campaign pledges. A new Morning Consult/Politico poll shows almost 70% of voters acknowledging that Trump has either met or exceeded expectations on his campaign agenda in the first month.\n\nA majority (56/27) credit him with keeping his promises. Given the lack of personal popularity Trump has and the hostile media environment in which he works, the White House has to understand that this will be his most potent form of political capital. Backtracking on Medicare and Social Security would strip Trump of his only political cover – the votes of middle America.\n\nFurthermore, Democrats and their progressive base have already arrayed themselves into a “resistance” rather than an opposition. The numbers do not exist to pass meaningful entitlement reform, as Democrats have little incentive to work with Trump in any policy area, let alone one for which they routinely demagogue Republicans. Even if Paul Ryan doesn’t recall the ads in which Democrats showed him pushing Grandma off a cliff in a wheelchair, Trump and his team will. A round of speculation after the election that merely suggested that Trump might be open to entitlement reform was enough for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to revive that campaign.\n\nEven if Trump agrees with Ryan, as the Speaker claimed in his interview with Lauer, that doesn’t put entitlement reform on the table in this session. Mulvaney hinted, and Spicer made explicitly clear, that the Trump administration wants to focus on discretionary spending in its first budget plan. That part of the budget gives Trump wide latitude for cutting government; even if Congress appropriates funds, the White House does not have to spend all of it in each policy area. Fights over legislative turf have already begun to crop up, which should keep both sides of Capitol Hill busy for the next several months on more routine fiscal matters.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Economic Plan: Spend Like a Democrat, Regulate Like a Republican\n\nA focus on keeping campaign promises could boost entitlement reform in the longer run, though. Trump will get his first test with the electorate in the 2018 midterms. Traditionally, first-term presidents do poorly, but Republicans have a huge structural advantage in the Senate races, defending only eight of the 33 seats up for election.\n\nDemocrats have to defend ten seats in states Trump won in November, and Republicans could end up with a filibuster-proof majority in the next session of Congress. Success depends on Trump keeping that political capital in play by delivering on his 2016 campaign pledges.\n\nAfter that, combined with two years of efforts to reduce spending and debt through the discretionary process, may give Trump and Republicans an opportunity to pull everyone together for a serious effort and success at entitlement reform. Until then, the opening won’t exist. Republicans might want to swallow hard and stop talking about it rather than miss the chance to get a lot more accomplished."

That's what an investigation by 4 Washington suggests, a local NBC News TV station in Washington, D.C., which used the Freedom of Information Act to access cases of workers viewing pornography while on the job.\n\nAbout 100 workers admitted to viewing porn…some for hours a day. One employee said he watched porn at his desk 6 hours a day for several years, according to the News4 I-Team. More troubling, some of the sites visited were loaded with child pornography.\n\nRelated: Watch Porn at Work, Get Paid by Uncle Sam\n\nThe FOIA request involved 12 government agencies, including the EPA, Transportation, Justice, Interior, USPS, Labor, NASA, Export-Import Bank, Commerce, Social Security, Energy and Health and Human Services.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/01/Why-Trump-Shouldn-t-Be-So-Worried-About-Trade-Deficit",
    "text": "Both during and after his campaign for president, Donald Trump was very focused on U.S. trade, and in particular on the fact that the country imports more than it exports, creating a net trade deficit. Despite the fact that most economists view the trade balance as a statistic that has no inherent positive or negative value in itself, Trump plainly saw the negative trade figure as some sort of national failing.\n\n“We’re losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade,” he said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “So we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn’t sound like it’s smart to me.”\n\nRelated: Will Trump’s Border Tax Anger Millions of Walmart Shoppers?\n\nHe returned to the topic on Tuesday night in his address to a joint session of Congress, labeling it one of the most “pressing problems” facing the country right now.\n\nBut just Trump has demonstrated something less than expertise when it comes to the global economy -- he reportedly made a late-night phone call to his former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, asking whether a strong dollar or a weak dollar was best for the economy -- his grasp of the significance of trade figures isn’t particularly solid.\n\nFortunately for the president, the economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, home to the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) Blog, are happy to help. In a recent post they explained the basics of national-level trade accounting and pointed out that for a country like the U.S., there are plenty of reasons to be thankful about a trade deficit, not alarmed.\n\n“[A] trade deficit automatically implies that the country is saving less than it’s investing,” they point out.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs the Border Tax to Secure Across-the-Board Tax Reform\n\nOkay, that sounds bad on its face, but they continue, “Another way to understand this is that the rest of the world is investing in that country, thereby contributing to its production capacity.”\n\nThey key element of the post is here: “Is it bad to have a trade account deficit? If this means that your economy is booming and local production cannot keep up with demand, then no. If it implies that there is a current account deficit and, hence, foreigners are investing in your country, then also no. If this means that you can have more investment without having to save more, because the rest of the world is picking up the slack, no again. If you are worried that in the future dividends will flow abroad, then yes. But that will happen only if your economy is in good shape in the first place and will be able to afford paying such dividends.”\n\nSo, as the president and Congress go back and forth over issues of trade policy, it’s important to keep in mind that reducing the trade gap is not beneficial in and of itself, and in some cases, might actually be a net negative for the country."

    "text": "Since the first Glock was designed and built by an Austrian curtain-rod manufacturer, Gaston Glock, in 1982, the sleek weapon has become the most popular handgun in America among both cops and criminals. In fact, the company claims that some 65 percent of U.S. police departments use Glocks, often the lightweight Glock 19 with its 15-round magazine.\n\nRelated: The Army’s New State-of-the-Art $580 Million Handgun\n\nBut when the Army decided to replace the M9 Beretta, the sidearm that’s been on the hips of soldiers for the past 30 years, it bypassed Smith & Wesson and Glock and handed a potential $580 million contract for its Modular Handgun System (MHS) to Sig Sauer. The German-controlled company will manufacture the Sig Sauer P320 in New Hampshire.\n\nHowever, as Bloomberg Businessweek writer Paul Barrett made clear in his 2012 book Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun, Glock doesn’t like to lose. It has filed a protest with the General Accounting Office, contesting the awarding of the contract to Sig Sauer.\n\nThe basis for contesting the contract is not clear from the filing, but by law, the GAO has 100 days from a bid protest filing to render a decision on whether the procurement process was flawed, so a judgment is due by early June.\n\nRelated: The Army Is Developing Its Most Lethal Gun Yet\n\nThe attorney for Glock was not immediately available for comment. But the website Bearing Arms says, “The fact Glock is protesting the decision strongly suggests that the company developed a ‘modular mystery Glock’ that has not yet been seen by the public. None of Glock’s existing handgun designs come close to being ‘modular.’”\n\nThe Sig Sauer P320 is designed to be adapted to the needs of the shooter and the mission: For example, the grip can be adjusted, it can be configured for silencers and it can be converted to fire three different types of ammunition.\n\nThe Army plans to phase in the P320 over the next decade, and the contract includes weapons, accessories and ammo. The Marines may make it the sidearm of choice, too."

    "text": "Over the past couple of weeks, the exorbitant cost of presidential travel has made its way into the spotlight.\n\nIn fact, President Donald Trump's travel itinerary cost US taxpayers more than $10 million during his first month in office, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Shouldn’t Give the Pentagon Another Dime\n\nPresidential travel is a highly complex logistical operation involving hundreds of people, dozens of vehicles, and a fleet of aircraft.\n\nAs a result, it easy to see how the bill can skyrocket very quickly.\n\nSo what does this operation entail?\n\nFirst, there's Air Force One, the call sign given to the Boeing VC-25A when the president is aboard. There are actually two planes that share that designation. The VC-25A is a highly modified version of the Boeing 747-200B airliner. Even though it entered service in 1990 with President George H.W. Bush, the jets — tail numbers 28000 and 29000 — were ordered in the mid-1980s by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nAccording to Boeing, each aircraft carries a crew of 26 along with roughly 70 passengers including the president, government officials, Secret Service agents, and guests. The 4,000-square-foot space in the VC-25A's cabin allows the aircraft to function as a flying White House with the ability to run a country from 40,000 feet. At the same time, the 747-200B's General Electric CF6-50 series engines were replaced with the more powerful CF6-80 series engines from the newer 747-300.\n\nRelated: The Very Worst US Airline of 2017 — and the Best\n\nOther presidential upgrades include:\n\nMidair-refueling capability\n\nMissile-defense systems\n\nElectronic countermeasure defense systems\n\nAn operating room\n\nThe ability survive the electromagnetic pulse emitted from a nuclear detonation\n\nThe communications capabilities to manage a wartime crisis from anywhere in the world\n\nOn major trips, both VC-25As make the trip — one with the president aboard and the other acting as backup in case of an emergency.\n\nAccording to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, the VC-25A cost a whopping $206,000 an hour to operate during a 2014 trip to Los Angeles by President Barack Obama. According to the documents, this figure included fuel, flight consumables, and maintenance.\n\nThis far exceeds the $20,000 to $25,000 an hour it costs an airline to operate a commercial 747, Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider in an email.\n\nThe VC-25As are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and are part of the US Air Force's 89th Airlift Wing.\n\nOther travel costs\n\nThen there are the limos. Affectionately known as \"The Beast,\" the presidential limos are heavy-duty armored vehicles built on a General Motors commercial truck platform with a Cadillac body. These monsters feature everything from full-ballistic protection to an on-board cache of blood for the president in case of a medical emergency.\n\nAccording to Autoweek, each one of Obama's 12 Beast limos cost $1.5 million. Trump will get a new version of the Beast. It's unclear how much the new model will cost.\n\nOn trips, these limos travel ahead with the advance team so they are waiting for the president once his plane arrives. This means they have to be transported ahead of time in a fleet of Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo planes.\n\nAnd in instances in which the president is in a hurry, he has the option to bypass the Beast and go with Marine One, the call sign for the presidential helicopter. The helicopters — Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or VH-60Ns or Boeing MV-22s — usually fly in a formation of three. These are operated by the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nSo, there you have it. Why is it so expensive for the president to fly? It's the custom jumbo jet, the staff and crew needed to operate the planes, the limos needed to transport the president to and from the plane, the cargo plane needed to transport the limos, and the helicopters in case the president wants to skip the car ride.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "text": "Newly sworn-in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross got an immediate taste of what it is like to serve in President Donald Trump’s cabinet on Tuesday when he had to do some quick clean-up work following the president’s joint address to Congress.\n\nTrump created some confusion with his remarks about taxation and trade, calling into question whether or not he was endorsing a controversial House Republican plan to impose a tax on goods imported into the United States.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs the Border Tax to Secure Across-the-Board Tax Reform\n\n“We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers,” he said. “Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.”\n\nCiting his discussions with American manufacturers, he said, “They have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it,” adding, “It is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.”\n\nTrump invoked one of his predecessors in defense of trade protectionism. “The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ‘abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.’ Lincoln was right — and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore.”\n\nTrump’s praise of protectionist policies and his promise to strike back against trading partners that tax US goods led many to believe that he was, at least in part, embracing the House tax plan.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nThe House Republicans are proposing the complete replacement of the existing corporate income tax structure with what is known as a Destination-Based Cash Flow Tax. The move would impose a 20 percent duty on all imports to the country while exempting all exports from taxation.\n\nThe plan is, to say the least, controversial. Manufacturers naturally love the idea of paying no US tax on the items they sell overseas. On the other hand, retailers who import a lot of goods for resale, are naturally unhappy about what the proposal would do to their costs.\n\nHowever, when Ross was buttonholed by reporters after Trump’s speech, he emphatically denied that the president had endorsed the DBCFT.\n\n\"No, he did not,” the Commerce Secretary told Reuters. “What he addressed was the issue that needs to be solved, which is there's inequitable treatment of the US. Other countries have a value-added tax which they rebate on exports...Border advisability, other programs are possible ways of solving that. But I didn't hear him coming out clearly in favor of any one system,” he said.\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nWhere Trump comes down on the question of a border tax -- he had reportedly said he views it as “too complicated -- will ultimately be very important to a broader package of tax cuts being contemplated by the GOP.\n\nBecause they are aiming to accomplish the cuts through the budget reconciliation process, they have to observe the rules governing that procedure which hold that such legislation cannot add to the federal deficit outside of a 10-year budget window. The revenue from the DBCTF is vital to keeping the tax plan within those parameters.\n\nHowever, despite the brief surge of hope among its supporters last night, the ultimate stance of the Trump administration relative to the border tax remains a mystery."

    "text": "President Donald Trump used his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night to renew his call to contain soaring prescription drug prices. His demand comes as the pharmaceutical industry launches a public relations campaign aimed at reducing public anger and the threat of increased regulation.\n\nTrump, who once complained that the pharmaceutical industry is “getting away with murder” by overcharging consumers and government agencies, said that his administration and Congress must “work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Lofty Vision of Renewal Comes with a Huge Price Tag\n\nWhile Trump didn’t provide specifics for what needs to be done, he and a number of lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD), have floated some ideas. Those include speeding up the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of generic drugs to compete with costlier brand name drugs, lifting a ban on Medicare officials negotiating the price of drugs, and allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\nPrescription drug prices have climbed at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at roughly that pace. Over the past two years, the pharmaceutical industry has been rocked by high-profile cases of drug companies raising their prices by as much as 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nLess than two weeks after taking office, Trump summoned the heads of many top drug manufacturers to the White House. Although Trump subsequently tempered his comments on drug industry pricing by focusing more on the need to step up price competition, he is under pressure from Sanders and other Democrats to make good on his campaign promises to halt price gouging and soaring prices.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its well-paid lobbyists have vigorously fought most of the reform proposals that have been advanced by Trump and lawmakers. They have argued, for example, that importation of cheaper drugs could jeopardize public health and that Medicare already benefits from deep discounts and rebates offered by major drug companies.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nWhile there’s no indication that drug manufacturers intend to dramatically curb their price increases, some are mounting a charm offensive to try to polish their tarnished image.\n\nDrug companies that once treated information about their retail pricing practices and discounting like state secrets are scrambling to adopt new price transparency practices in an effort to overcome their reputation as price gougers. And many in the industry are striving to hold their average drug price increases to below 10 percent.\n\nThe latest company to step up to the plate is Johnson & Johnson, the prescription drug and medical supplies behemoth, which on Monday issued its first-ever public report on price increases for its prescription drugs. The company disclosed that the list price of its drugs rose on average by less than 10 percent a year over the past five years. What’s more, the net price that the company received after granting discounts and paying fees to middlemen increased by just five percent or less per year, according to Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThose numbers might suggest a relatively prudent approach to marketing – and a far cry from Turing Pharmaceutical’s 5,000 percent price hike for a 62-year old drug used in treating parasitic infections, or Mylan’s 670 percent increase in price for a two-set pack of EpiPen allergy auto-injectors used to treat children suffering from violent reactions to bee stings and food allergies.\n\nYet Johnson & Johnson’s drug price increases were still more than twice the U.S. rate of inflation, meaning that drug prices rose at a much faster clip than prices for food, clothing and other goods and services. Also, the company’s disclosures were based on annual averages, which means that in many cases the company charged much steeper price increases for their drugs.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nAt the same time that Johnson & Johnson went public with its price list, other major companies wary of a public and political backlash are intentionally holding their drug price increases to below 10 percent, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFor example, Allergan’s CEO, Brent Saunders, announced that his company would raise prices by two or three percentage points rather than the 7.4 percent average increase that the company set in January, at the start of a new marketing season.\n\nA more dramatic illustration of this trend came after Marathon Pharmaceuticals sparked an outcry two weeks ago by establishing an $89,000 a year starting price for a muscular-dystrophy treatment that has been on the market for decades and could be purchased abroad for $1,600. After lawmakers and other complained about the pending action, Marathon announced it was postponing the price hike.\n\nThroughout the industry, drug companies are more carefully calibrating their price increases to avoid drawing unwelcome attention and criticism, especially from Trump.\n\nA new analysis by the investment firm Raymond James & Associates found that drug manufacturers didn’t raise list prices for as many of their drugs in January as they did the previous year, and that they initiated fewer increases of 10 percent or more. Just 5.5 percent of all the price hikes reached the 10 percent level last month, according to the report, compared with 15 percent that did so in 2016, and 20 percent two years ago.\n\n“You have to give credit to the government-relations departments of the major drug companies,” said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute. “They read the newspaper. And certainly, early on at least, Trump was talking about unconscionable profits of the drug industry and using very anti-PhRMA language.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/03/01/Trump-s-Six-Rules-Replacing-Obamacare",
    "text": "President Donald Trump declared during his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night that the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act was just around the corner. But this time he urged recalcitrant Democrats to join with Republicans in dismantling what he described as an “imploding” national health insurance program.\n\n“I am calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare,” Trump said to the cheers and howls of GOP lawmakers in the House chamber while Democratic Senate and House members sat impassively. “Obamacare is collapsing – and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.”\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nTrump waited nearly 40 minutes into his lengthy speech before first broaching what many think is the most urgent challenge facing the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress this year – and one that carries the biggest political risks for the GOP if the whole repeal and replace venture blows up in their face.\n\nLawmakers just returned from a week-long recess, and many Republicans were shaken by angry constituent protests against repealing Obamacare during town hall meetings and street demonstrations. Polls also indicate that Obamacare is growing in popularity among voters just as the Republicans are pressing to repeal it this spring.\n\nWith growing signs that neither Trump nor congressional Republican leaders are anywhere near agreement on a consensus replacement plan that doesn’t strip millions of Americans of their health insurance or expanded Medicaid coverage, GOP lawmakers were eager last night to hear a rallying cry from the new president.\n\n“Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,” Trump said. “The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.”\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\nBut if the Republicans in the chamber or watching on television were hoping for a little more clarity as to what a package of Trumpcare reforms might look like – and how the various\n\nproposals would interact so that millions of Americans don’t lose their health care insurance in the transition – they were in for a disappointment.\n\nTrump indeed outlined five or six bedrock “principles” for the replacement legislation. But most of them were familiar ideas left over from the presidential campaign or newer, more controversial ideas -- but without any meat on the bone.\n\nFirst, he would preserve the Obamacare rule preventing insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing health conditions. That idea, along with another Obamacare feature allowing children to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies until they turn age 26, have both been met with universal support on Capitol Hill.\n\nSecond, Trump said he favors granting tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance policies of their choice, although he doesn’t say what kind of credit. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other House GOP leaders have pushed the idea of a refundable tax credit based on age, with older and wealthier Americans getting the lion’s share of the benefit. However, many conservatives have opposed that approach, saying that it is too close to the current tax subsidy in Obamacare and that its adoption would create a new entitlement.\n\n\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nTrump also favors expanded tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts to help consumers cover some of their medical costs, but that’s a no brainer and has become boilerplate for most of the replacement plans making the rounds.\n\nThird, Trump signaled support for changes in the Medicaid program to “give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.” This is an important point because Trump once said he would protect Medicaid, along with other entitlement programs, and now he is embracing an approach that likely would lead to converting Medicaid to state block grants.\n\nWhile the block grant or per capita payment approach would result in billions of dollars of savings to the federal government in years to come, it would likely force states to sharply reducing coverage and benefits to low-income Americans, which costs $6,833 per person annually, on average. The idea is highly controversial and has been strongly opposed by some Republican governors as well as the Democrats.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe last three principles are proposals Trump campaigned on: Tort reform to protect doctors from excessive and costly litigation; more freedom for major insurance companies to sell policies across state lines and efforts to “bring down the artificially high price of drugs.”\n\nAs Politico reported, Republicans lack consensus on some of the most basic questions, such as “how much to spend to reshape the health system, how much financial help to give Americans to buy insurance and how to come up with the money to pay for it all.”\n\nTrump at one time boasted that he would repeal and replace Obamacare “simultaneously” shortly after he took office, but his repeated promises to unveil a comprehensive plan that would provide less expensive and better quality coverage than Obamacare have all fallen through. During his meeting with the National Governors Association at the White House on Monday, Trump acknowledged, “Now, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated.”"

    "text": "From the beginning of his campaign, Donald Trump claimed the U.S. military had been “devastated” by budget cuts. He vowed to dramatically increase the defense budget to ensure that America could “start winning again.”\n\nWe now know that he plans to increase the Pentagon’s budget by $54 billion at the expense of other agencies, including the State Department, which won’t sit well with many lawmakers.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s ‘Historic’ $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nThere’s no doubt that our military forces have declined since the U.S. actually “won” a war, at least from Trump’s point of view — and that was nine months before he was born in 1946. For the next 30 years, young men were drafted unless they were deferred, like Trump, for attending college and having bad feet.\n\nIn 1968, 3,547,902 U.S. military personnel set a record. Today, the number of military personnel is 38 percent of that level, 1,354,054. But does the country need massive numbers of fighting forces when we drop bombs from planes that have no pilots? Do we need 20th-century weapons and hardware when the priorities are cyber security and high-tech weaponry?\n\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, which specified $917 billion of cuts over 10 years and triggered the sequester, forced the Pentagon to choose between new technology and old war machinery. In an outright act of defiance, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus simply refused to include the $17 billion in cuts over five years ordered by his boss, Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nMabus and peers know how to fight for their turf. He might have thought if the Air Force can spend a trillion dollars on a plane that is still not fully operational – the notorious F-35 – why should the Navy hold back on its littoral combat ships, even though the $21 billion program has engineering design flaws?\n\nRelated: From Strip Clubs to Combat Ships, McCain Blasts $13 Billion in Pentagon Waste\n\nSo, should Trump give the Pentagon the money it lost due to the sequester? Here are 10 reasons to say no.\n\nThey Can't Balance Their Books?\n\n1. We have no idea how the Pentagon spent more than $8.5 trillion since 1996 because they still can't properly submit to an audit. Congress passed a law in 2009 requiring the Defense Department to be audited this year. But a Reuters investigation found that the Pentagon uses moribund accounting systems that are completely incompatible with modern accounting practices and computing. If you don’t want anyone to see what you’re doing, make sure they can’t look.\n\n2. The Army needs remedial courses in basic math. The Army actually presented their books to the Inspector General last year for an audit. The result was not encouraging: The IG found $2.8 trillion of accounting mistakes and many missing receipts and invoices to support the figures.\n\n3. There is a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors — and nobody knows how much of that money paid for actual goods and services. The sloppiness of the Pentagon’s procurement systems is such that almost anyone inside or outside could rip them off and they probably wouldn’t know it.\n\nCooking the Books and Outright Fraud\n\n4. Looks like the Pentagon will lie or cheat to keep the money flowing. The Pentagon buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste in its business operations fearing Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\n5. Here’s a doozy, again from the Reuters investigation: “Bookkeepers insert phony numbers in the U.S. Department of Defense’s accounts. The secretary of defense's office and the heads of the military and Defense Finance and Accounting Service have for years knowingly signed off on false entries. ‘I don't think they're lying and cheating and stealing necessarily, but it's not the right thing to do,’ Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale told Reuters. ‘We've got to fix the processes, so we don't have to do that.’” Whoa—so we don’t have to do that?\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nThat’s Not My Job\n\n6. Who cares if we waste $33 billion? The Defense Department could save itself a cool $33 billion if Pentagon leaders took a firmer hand with wasteful programs and imposed some basic budget discipline, according to the Center for International Policy. Among the examples:\n\n$150 million for luxurious private villas for contractors in Afghanistan\n\n$720 million in late fees for leased shipping containers\n\n$468 million for C-27A transport aircraft in Afghanistan that had to be scrapped\n\n$857 million on excess parts and supplies\n\n$49 million on sports advertising\n\n$1 billion to get rid of $16 billion of outdated munitions, which may have been useable\n\n7. The Pentagon may be learning disabled. A yearlong ProPublica investigation into Afghanistan reconstruction that found a widespread failure to apply lessons from Iraq was in part to blame for upwards of $17 billion in waste. One of the best was a $43 million natural gas station that's unsafe to use.\n\nIncompetence\n\n8. The Pentagon sucks at missile systems: It spent $40 billion over a decade on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) domestic missile defense system that has repeatedly failed the most rudimentary tests of its effectiveness in shooting enemy missiles out of the sky. A few years earlier, an investigation by the Los Angeles Times concluded that the $2.2 billion Sea Based X-Band Radar, which is responsible for spotting enemy missiles, doesn’t work and is essentially nothing more than an enormous waste of tax dollars that has left the U.S. vulnerable to attack.\n\n9. The Pentagon doesn’t know how to take inventory of its stores of weapons ammunitions and supplies. When they run out of anything, they simply buy more and keep stuff that even your grandfather wouldn’t sell on eBay.\n\nThe Defense Budget Is Already Huge\n\n10. We spend more than Russia, China, and five other major countries together."

    "text": "Delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress as chief executive, Donald Trump on Tuesday night achieved something that has largely eluded him in the weeks since taking the oath of office: he managed to look presidential.\n\nHis hour-long address was sober and focused, avoiding the discursive rambling that characterizes much of his public speaking. He hit on the issues that animated both his campaign and the first days of his presidency: restricting immigration, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, funding a massive infrastructure program, and investing huge sums in a military buildup. At the same time, he failed to address many of the challenges the country faces on the world stage, including Russian aggression and the ongoing crises in Syria and across the Middle East.\n\nRelated: Putting Trump’s ‘Historic’ $54 Billion Military Spending Boost Into Context\n\nTrump’s performance earned immediate accolades from pundits accustomed to watching him deliver unscripted speeches in which he lurches from topic to topic, hurling epithets at his opponents and red meat to his base. CNN commentator Van Jones and Fox News host Chris Wallace, hardly ideological soulmates, independently proclaimed that with the speech Trump “became president of the United States.”\n\nIt’s worth pausing to consider just how far the bar has been lowered here. As presidential addresses go, this was not Lincoln’s Second Inaugural or even FDR’s first. For the most part, Trump delivered a workman-like recitation of the words on his teleprompter and avoided saying anything too outrageous. The rapturous reception seems to reflect as much surprise at his ability to behave like a president for the space of an hour as it does the reaction to the actual content of his remarks.\n\nAs many presidents have done before him, Trump populated the audience with guests meant to magnify the emotional punch of some parts of his remarks. In a particularly memorable moment, he drew attention to Carryn Owens, the widow of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens, who died during a raid in Yemen six days into Trump’s term.\n\nThe president has faced considerable criticism for the operation, which also took the lives of more than a dozen civilians. No senior terrorist figures were captured or killed in the raid, and there have been conflicting reports about the value of the intelligence that was gathered from it. And, in a sharp break from precedent, Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News that the responsibility for Owens’ death lay with “the generals” who devised the operation, not with him as commander-in-chief.\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nHowever, Trump lingered on the subject for some time Tuesday night, leading a lengthy standing ovation for Mrs. Owens, and quoting Secretary of Defense James Mattis as saying, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.”\n\nDirecting his words to a weeping Mrs. Owens, he added, “Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.” The “record” appeared to be a reference to the long round of applause.\n\nA recurring theme in Trump’s remarks was a call to Democrats in Congress to come together with Republicans to pass some of Trump’s legislative priorities. The opposition party, which has little formal power in the capital, has been resisting the confirmation of many of the president’s cabinet appointees and has so far shown little appetite for compromise.\n\n“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,” Trump said. “Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.”\n\nRelated: There’s Good News for Trump Buried in This New Poll\n\nAs he summed up, though, he seemed to belittle the concerns of the members of Congress who have opposed his agenda. “The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.”\n\nWith the words “trivial fights,” he gestured to his right, where the Democrats in the audience were sitting, producing audible grumbling.\n\nTrump opened his remarks with a long-awaited condemnation of bigotry and racially charged violence, something he has been sharply criticized for failing to address when given multiple opportunities over the past several weeks.\n\n“Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.”\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nIn a press conference in February, Trump had suggested that a well-documented surge in anti-Semitic acts and threats following his inauguration might actually be attributable to his political opponents trying to make him look bad.\n\nThe overall tone of the speech, hopeful and optimistic, was markedly different from the inaugural address that Trump delivered on January 20, which was replete with dark descriptions of a country in decline and beset by enemies.\n\nWhether or not the speech reflects a lasting change of tone from the Trump administration is something that will only become apparent in the weeks and days ahead, as the president continues to push his agenda through executive orders and calls on Congress to pass legislation"

    "text": "President Trump wants tax reform. The American people want tax reform. American companies want tax reform. Investors and markets want tax reform. Democrats? They don’t want anything Mr. Trump wants. Period.\n\nThat’s why policymakers, led by Paul Ryan, have settled on the border adjustment tax (BAT). It’s the only way Republicans in Congress can overhaul our Byzantine tax system through the budget reconciliation process. And that cumbersome approach is the only path available to the GOP, given that they lack 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Why Ryan’s ‘Border Adjustment’ Import Tax Is So Controversial\n\nUnder reconciliation, the proposal must be revenue neutral over the ten-year budget window and thereafter. Since the evolving plan includes sharp reductions in personal and corporate rates, among many other changes, there is substantial lost revenue – and the only vehicle available to make that up is the border adjustment tax.\n\nThere are many proposed changes to both personal and corporate taxes in the plan coming out of the House. Here we focus on changing the way corporations are taxed, and on the merits of the border adjustment tax.\n\nLevying a new tax may seem complicated – this revamp after all is supposed to simplify our tax code – but compared to the 75,000 pages of our current tax rules, adopting the new approach would be like reading Dick and Jane after a semester of Ulysses. Numerous deductions disappear and the plan adopts territorial taxation, used by most other countries – which eliminates the unproductive stockpiling of earnings overseas. Most important, the corporate rate drops from 35% to 20%.\n\nWhat makes it all work is the 20% border adjustment tax, which raises more than a trillion dollars over a decade.\n\nPresident Trump has sent mixed signals about his support for the BAT, and there appears to be some division amongst his White House staff. Most recently Steve Bannon threw his considerable weight behind the plan, joining other influential figures like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nNational Economic Council director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are said to oppose the tax, but some feel these relative newcomers to tax minutia will soon realize that the scheme drafted by Paul Ryan and others is the only possible way to meet the criteria set out by Congress’ own budget rules. Several groups have worked on tax policy for nearly a decade; if there were an easier approach, they would have found it.\n\nRelated: With Businesses Split on U.S. Border Tax, Wider Reform Looks Shaky\n\nFor instance, many might think that revenues lost to dropping the corporate rate could be recaptured simply by eliminating the numerous tax breaks that companies currently enjoy. Our stated tax rate for companies is 39.1 percent, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent, one of the highest in the world. Our effective corporate rate – what companies actually pay on average after taking advantage of various deductions – is 27.9 percent, also one of the highest globally.\n\nSo why would slicing the rate to 20 percent be so tough? The problem is that most companies pay the lower rate mainly because they earn so much money overseas. It’s not because of depletion allowances or because of investment tax credits; it’s because Apple, for instance, earns more than two-thirds of its income overseas and pays taxes on those earnings at very low rates. Further, like many large companies, Apple keeps its foreign-earned cash overseas. Our government has no authority under current law to tax overseas operations until the money is brought home.\n\nThe border adjustment tax is like the Value Added Tax employed by 167 countries around the world. The idea is to tax goods coming into the country but not those flowing out. In effect, our government would reward exporters and penalize importers. In Europe, in part to attract investment and encourage exports, governments have lowered corporate income tax rates in recent years but made up for lost revenues by hiking their VATs.\n\nAs a consequence, companies making goods domestically in Germany, for instance, pay a 15 percent corporate tax rate (local fees add substantially to the total) but the federal government recoups revenues lost to that low rate through a 19 percent VAT on all domestic sales. The 19 percent levy on goods sold overseas is refunded, giving German exporters a significant competitive advantage.\n\nRelated: CEOs of 16 U.S. Companies Urge Congress to Pass Border Tax\n\nThere are already companies lining up to endorse and also to oppose the border adjustment tax. A group called the American Made Coalition, which includes exporters like GE, Boeing, and Pfizer, are in favor of the measure while Americans for Affordable Products – retailers like Walmart and others that depend heavily on imports – are dead set against it. The latter group says prices will rise, hurting consumers and the economy.\n\nSome economists, like Martin Feldstein, argue that any consumer price hikes caused by a border tax will quickly be resolved through currency realignments. Thus, the cost to Americans of goods made overseas but paid for in dollars will drop. That connect-the-dots seems too theoretical, and the timing too uncertain, to boost confidence in the plan.\n\nIt is more likely that there will be perceived winners and losers, at least in the short run. Consequently, pushing the proposed plan will be a heavy lift for Republicans in Congress, especially with the likes of Elizabeth Warren screeching about how it is a gift to the billionaire class and a scourge to working people.\n\nBut Trump can turn that around and argue that the border tax will create jobs for working people – the kind who helped elect him. He has fractured the age-old alliance between labor and Democrats; last year he earned more union votes than any Republican since Reagan, by pushing a growth and jobs agenda. Trump needs to enlist union leaders to sell his tax overhaul to the country and to skeptical members of Congress.\n\nRelated: Walmart Warns That Trump's Tax Plan Could Hurt Consumers\n\nHe will ask Americans: are you willing to pay slightly more for your made-in-China t-shirts in order to put more people to work? At the same time, labor leaders will ask the 23 Democrat senators up for reelection in 2018, “Do you support tax reform that will bring manufacturing jobs back home and levels the playing field for American companies? Do you support Made in America” What can they say?\n\nNone of this will be easy, but if Trump wants to spur economic growth and job creation – the centerpiece of his campaign – driving through tax reform is essential. Sold the right way, Americans will climb aboard the Trump train."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Putting-Trump-s-Historic-54-Billion-Military-Spending-Boost-Context",
    "text": "Monday unveiled a proposal to boost military spending by $54 billion and cut an equal amount from non-defense spending, reportedly including reductions to the budgets of agencies such as the State Department and the EPA. President Trump said his proposed federal budget for next year represents an “historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it.”\n\nRelated: Conflicting Signals on How Trump Will Pay for His $54 Billion Military Buildup\n\nIf $54 billion sounds like a lot, well, it is. While it’s just about 1.4 percent of the $3.9 trillion in federal spending for 2016, it represents a 9.2 percent increase above the $584 billion spent on defense last year. The request comes less than three months after The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon buried a proposal to cut $125 billion in wasteful administrative spending over five years. And as Slate’s Fred Kaplan explains:\n\nThe wars we’re fighting now don’t require huge, expensive weapons systems. President Obama’s last budget, which the Pentagon is spending now, allotted $7.5 billion for the war against ISIS, $6.7 billion for cyber defenses, and $1.2 billion for counterterrorist drone operations. Double all that, and you’ve spent an extra $15.4 billion, less than one-third of Trump’s increase.\n\nAs you can see in the Defense Department’s topline budget chart below, the $54 billion increase would boost military spending back to where it was during the early years of the Obama presidency, before the caps imposed by sequestration. (Budget expert Stan Collender notes that those spending caps imposed under the 2011 Budget Control Act will be a legal obstacle to Trump’s budget plans.)\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nOn the other hand, our defense budget is already far bigger than it was a decade ago, and nearly double what it was in 2001 — and that largely holds true even if you don’t count the extra money allotted for “Overseas Contingency Operations,” the funds allocated separately that pay for our wars.\n\nCurrent dollars in billions. Source: Department of Defense\n\nAs a share of GDP and of total federal spending, though, the defense budget smaller than it has been in recent years, as you can see in these two charts:\n\nSource: Department of Defense\n\nSource: Department of Defense\n\nThe problem is that, as our population ages, mandatory spending on entitlements including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other programs like unemployment compensation, federal and military retirement benefits now account for more than 60 percent of federal spending. Those are the biggest drivers of federal spending. Adding in interest on the federal debt takes leaves discretionary spending — on defense and everything else — at about 31 percent of federal spending. Since Trump has promised not to cut Social Security or Medicare, and will face pressure not to raise the deficit, boosting defense spending by $54 billion thus requires slashing spending by 12 percent in areas where there’s relatively little left to cut — areas like infrastructure, scientific and medical research, environmental protection, foreign aid and others.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts — Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nHere’s one other way to look at the $54 billion boost to the defense budget, provided by Statista: U.S. defense spending already dwarfs that of the rest of the world, and the annual increase would be roughly equal to the entire military expenditures of France ($51 billion in 2015), the U.K. ($55 billion in 2015) or Russia ($66 billion in 2015).\n\nYou will find more statistics at Statista"

    "text": "High profile Republicans, both in and out of office, are sounding increasingly serious about the need for an investigation that can put the rumors of contact and potential coordination between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government to rest -- or prove them true.\n\n“We need answers,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said on NBC in an interview that aired Tuesday morning. “We need to make sure that nothing happened that shouldn't have happened as we go forward.”\n\nRelated: Schumer: Trump’s Address to Congress ‘Less Important than Other Presidents’\n\n“Both the House and the Senate intelligence committees are beginning their investigations right now. We've had one for a while. We're increasing the scope of the investigation,” Ryan said. “We think the intelligence community is the right place to do it.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, former House Speaker and Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich called on Trump -- whom he supported during the election -- to “take a lesson from the past” by assigning a respected, independent figure to oversee an investigation.\n\n“Maybe somebody like Michael Mukasey, former attorney general,” Gingrich suggested. “Put them in charge of the whole project, and say, you know, there are questions here, the country has questions, the media has questions, even members of Congress have questions,” Gingrich said.\n\nThe comments from Ryan and Gingrich come as part of a growing drumbeat of calls to dig deeper into Trump’s alleged Russian connections from people on both sides of the political aisle. But the story is confusing and has a large cast of characters. For those who haven’t been paying attention, here’s a rundown of the major figures involved.\n\nWho is reportedly being investigated?\n\nMichael Flynn\n\nThe retired Army lieutenant general who served, albeit briefly, as President Trump’s national security adviser, is at the heart of the story. He is alleged to have had several conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in the weeks after Trump was elected but before he took office. It has been alleged that he suggested that Russia not react to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over apparent interference in the presidential election, because the sanctions might be eased or reversed by Trump. While the conversations themselves may have been legal, Flynn reportedly lied about them to senior White House officials and was subsequently fired.\n\nRelated: There’s Good News for Trump Buried in This New Poll\n\nPaul Manafort\n\nAn attorney and the one-time head of the Trump campaign, Manafort is well known for his service to dictators and autocrats over the years. He has been tied to Russia through his association with deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort has denied any contact with Russia during his time with the Trump campaign.\n\nCarter Page\n\nA minor figure in the Trump campaign, Page was mentioned early on as an adviser on foreign policy issues, but took a leave of absence after it was reported that he was under investigation for his contacts with a Russian political figure under U.S. sanctions. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a former Marine, Page is the founder of Global Energy Capital, an investment firm focused on the oil and gas sector in Russia and Central Asia. Early this year, The New York Times reported that along with Manafort and Trump associate Roger Stone, Page was being investigated as part of the inquiry into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties. Like Manafort, he says that he has done nothing improper.\n\nRoger Stone\n\nA former dirty-tricks specialist for Richard M. Nixon, Stone has been a fringe player in conservative politics for many years, and was an early adviser to Trump. He subsequently left the campaign, but continued to act as an unofficial surrogate. Over the summer, he appeared to have advance knowledge of the release of documents damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign -- documents that U.S. intelligence officials believe were stolen by Russia-sponsored hackers.\n\nWho is doing the investigating?\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe FBI, with the support of the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury Department, is believed to be looking at the ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. While the FBI has made no official comment on the investigation, the White House insists that it has been informed by FBI officials that there is nothing to the allegations. Pressed by the White House, CIA Director Mike Pompeo reportedly called reporters at the Times and The Washington Post to say reports about the investigation were incorrect, but provided no details.\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes\n\nThe California congressman in charge of the Intelligence Committee is courting controversy by overseeing an investigation into the Trump campaign, because he himself was deeply involved in it. Nunes this week even suggested that there was really little need to investigate the Trump campaign and said he was actually more interested in finding out who has been leaking information to reporters. Paul Ryan’s talk about the “increased scope” of the committee’s investigation, though, might signal a change in tack.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr\n\nBurr, a Republican from North Carolina, also appears to have prejudiced himself somewhat this week by obliging the White House’s request for officials to push back against the idea that the campaign had contact with Russia. Like Pompeo, he called reporters and denied that the stories about the investigation were accurate. Also like Pompeo, he offered no details. Burr has also appeared reluctant to support an aggressive inquiry into the issue by his committee, and reports that he had called reporters to prejudge its results have led many to question his ability to be impartial."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Least-20-States-Are-Fighting-Battles-Over-Voting-Restrictions",
    "text": "Amid President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in the 2016 election, bills have been introduced in at least 20 states that would make it more difficult for many people to vote.\n\nIn some states, such as Texas and Arkansas, lawmakers are responding to court rulings that struck down or scaled back earlier attempts to restrict voting. Bills in other states would make changes to early voting and registration deadlines.\n\nRelated: Why Are Republicans Making It Harder to Fight Voter Fraud?\n\nProponents of the legislation say the proposed limitations, such as requiring a photo ID and eliminating Election Day registration, are necessary to restore public confidence in the electoral system. They say the measures protect the integrity of the ballot box by confirming voters’ identities and whether they are qualified to vote. In state legislatures the measures are backed mainly by Republicans, though polls show that most Democrats also support a photo ID requirement.\n\n“Confidence has been eroded. Even if it’s just anecdotal evidence, people are questioning whether the ballot is secure,” said Arkansas state Rep. Mark Lowery, a Republican who is sponsoring a photo ID law there. “When there’s a lack of confidence in the election, it undermines confidence in democracy itself.”\n\nBut critics point to a lack of evidence of voter fraud, and say the restrictions are unnecessary and unfairly discriminate against minorities and poor people, who may not have a birth certificate, passport or driver’s license.\n\n“Many of these laws are nothing new,” said Danielle Lang with the Campaign Legal Center, which has sued over many restrictive state voting laws. “But there’s a different message coming from this administration, and it’s one that will embolden states.”\n\nAccording to an analysis this month from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, bills in 21 states would impose new restrictions on voting. At least twelve states are considering bills that would require a photo ID to vote, or expand existing ID requirements. Legislators in Texas and Virginia want to require proof of citizenship to register to vote, which would prevent unauthorized immigrants from casting ballots. Bills in Connecticut and Iowa, among others, would eliminate Election Day registration. Some states such as Colorado, Iowa and Texas are considering bills that would shorten the early voting period. Still others would limit who can collect and turn in ballots for other people.\n\nWith some of the proposals, lawmakers are attempting to modify laws that have been struck down or blunted in court, in hopes that they will be able to withstand judicial review.\n\nRelated: Trump’s GOP Echo Chamber Amplifies His Claim About Voter Fraud\n\nIn Arkansas, for example, where a 2013 photo ID law was struck down by the courts, Lowery and other Republicans have introduced a bill that would expand the accepted forms of identification, such as a driver’s license, to include student IDs and public assistance cards that have a photo.\n\n“I don’t buy the argument that there would be a lot of people who don’t have a photo ID,” Lowery said, but broadening the accepted forms of ID will make it easier for people who do have trouble getting some types of ID.\n\nCritics who have challenged the laws before say the new attempts may not take care of the legal problems with the restrictions.\n\nJonathan Brater with the Brennan Center said that as courts reviewed voting laws over the last year, they often found that they were discriminatory — and that there was little evidence they were addressing real problems. The new laws, he said, “are going to face some of those same barriers in court.”\n\nSince Election Day, Trump has repeatedly called the election “rigged” and claimed, without evidence, that between 3 million and 5 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally.\n\nBut research has found in-person voter fraud to be extremely rare, as are cases of voting by people who aren’t U.S. citizens. News reports following the 2016 election found nearly no cases of fraud. One recent study found that Hispanics are the most affected by voter ID laws, with turnout 7 percent lower for Hispanic voters in states with strict voter ID laws.\n\nTrying Again\n\nIn Texas, a 2011 law allowed people to vote only if they had one of seven approved forms of ID, including a driver’s license, military ID or passport. But a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blunted the law by allowing people who did not have one of the accepted IDs to vote as long as they filled out an affidavit first. A legal battle over whether the law was intended to discriminate against minorities is ongoing. A federal court in Texas is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week.\n\nRelated: Trump's voter fraud probe could pave way for tougher voting rules\n\nMeanwhile, the state is considering a number of bills that would restrict access to voting.\n\nIn addition to bills requiring proof of citizenship to vote, the state is considering shortening its early voting period, limiting absentee voting, and changing its photo ID law. A bill introduced last week would allow those without a photo ID to present a utility bill or paycheck along with an affidavit. But it would impose harsh penalties — up to 10 years in prison — for people who use the alternatives when they do possess an ID.\n\nThe bill is designed to comply with the earlier U.S. Circuit Court ruling that said the state should offer free birth certificates and give people without IDs a way to cast a ballot.\n\nEzra Rosenberg with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has brought one of the cases against the law, said the bill addresses some of the court’s concerns. But he said the harsh penalties for people who have an ID but instead use one of the alternatives could intimidate voters.\n\nIn Kansas, officials tried to require voters to prove their citizenship before their votes could be counted in state elections, something that wasn’t required of people who registered to vote using the federal form or at a Department of Motor Vehicles office. A state court judge said Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican, lacked the authority to require those voters to cast provisional ballots in state elections, and a federal court judge issued an injunction requiring Kansas to count the votes of all registered voters for the 2016 election.\n\nKobach’s office has now asked for legislation to expand the power of the office, allowing them to set aside ballots cast in state and local elections until a voter can show proof of citizenship.\n\n“This bill does exactly that — what the state court judge says we did not have the authority to do,” said Bryan Caskey, the deputy assistant secretary of state for elections.\n\nMicah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, which has previously challenged Kobach’s proof of citizenship requirement, said passing the legislation won’t help the state withstand future court battles.\n\n“State courts have ruled he does not have the authority under statute to do this, but if the Legislature gives him the authority under statute to do it, it doesn’t mean constitutional issues get waived away,” he said.\n\nRelated: Trump says Pence will lead voter fraud panel\n\nIn Arkansas, legislators are considering a constitutional amendment that would require photo ID to vote after a similar 2013 law was struck down. The Arkansas Supreme Court said the law contradicted the state constitution by adding an additional requirement to vote without the necessary two-thirds vote of the Legislature. Arkansas lawmakers have the power to amend the voting rights and procedures section of their constitution without referring the changes to voters if approved by a two-thirds majority of each house.\n\nLowery said his proposal would avoid problems by requiring an ID to verify someone’s voter registration rather than making it a prerequisite to vote.\n\n“We believe we have listened to the court,” he said. “We’ve sought the two-thirds super majority, and we’ve written the legislation in such a way that it only deals with verifying voter registration.”\n\nLang said tailoring a law to deal with registration rather than voting is a “distinction without a difference” because the law could still stop people from voting.\n\nRita Sklar, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, agreed. “The problem is they are doing the same thing over and over again when it’s been shown that is has the effect of disenfranchising voters.”\n\nLegislators are also still weighing a separate constitutional amendment requiring photo ID to vote. If approved, voters would settle the matter in the 2018 election.\n\nVarying Approaches\n\nThe number of states with photo ID laws and other restrictive voting laws has expanded considerably since a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down a provision of the federal Voting Rights Act that required some states and counties, mainly in the South, to get the U.S. Department of Justice’s approval before changing election laws. Voters in 14 states faced new restrictions on voting in the 2016 election.\n\nThe photo ID bills proposed this year in a dozen states vary widely. In North Dakota, only a driver’s license, a non-driver ID or a tribal ID would be acceptable. In other states, student IDs, concealed carry permits and military IDs could also be used.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate defended the state’s elections as “clean and fair” after Trump claimed the system was rigged. He is now pushing a bill that would require ID to vote and would make voter ID cards without photos available to people who don’t have photo ID. The bar codes on the IDs would allow the state to ensure that ballots are not cast in two places.\n\nMany of the other bills include strict photo ID requirements, which can be tough for people who lack the underlying documentation, such as a birth certificate, needed to get an ID. Some can’t afford the costs of getting an official birth certificate or were born under circumstances in which they never had one. Such is the case for many Native Americans living in North Dakota.\n\nJoel West Williams with the Native American Rights Fund, which represents several Native Americans who are suing over two of the state’s previous photo ID laws, said the requirements put people in a “loop where you have to have an ID in order to get documents you need in order to get an ID.”\n\nLike Texas, North Dakota is considering tweaks to its photo ID laws while they are still being challenged in court. A bill there would allow people to use a utility bill or government check to supplement IDs without addresses, something common among tribal IDs. But Williams said the changes likely wouldn’t help Native Americans because many get mail at a P.O. box instead of their physical address.\n\nIn some states, such as Texas, lawmakers want to require proof of citizenship to vote.\n\n“The honor system is nice. It’s quaint,” but it doesn’t do enough, said Texas state Sen. Van Taylor, a Republican whose bill would require linking the state’s voter registration database with a Department of Public Safety database that has citizenship information for people with state IDs.\n\nHe points to the story of a Mexican woman brought to the U.S. as a child who was sentenced to eight years in prison after she registered to vote and later cast ballots in 2012 and 2014 as proof that noncitizens do vote in elections. The woman, who has previously voted Republican, said she was unaware she was not allowed to vote.\n\nTaylor’s proposal would likely affect many of the same people affected by the state’s photo ID law. And having a state-issued ID doesn’t necessarily prove that someone is a citizen: there are more than 139,000 people with Texas IDs whose citizenship status is unknown to the state, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\n“Poor people don’t have passports,” said James Harrington, founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which pushes to expand voting rights. He said requiring proof of citizenship is not purely partisan, but will likely impact Hispanics. “It’s targeted at preventing the inevitable demographic change of control of the state … people who represent Hispanic interests are going to be quite different from the people who are in power now.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

    "text": "In advance of his address to a joint session of Congress, Donald Trump sat down with the hosts of Fox & Friends to offer some of the details of the budget plan he was to unveil later that night.\n\nBut his assessment of how he expects to pay for a $54 billion increase in the Pentagon budget -- extraordinary economic growth -- doesn’t seem to jibe with that of his top budget expert, who is prepping the executive branch for massive reductions in non-defense spending.\n\nRelated: Trump's Military Buildup Makes Even His Generals Nervous\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump stuck to the White House claim that the funds will come, in part, from cuts to the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. But those cuts can’t cover the full amount, the Fox hosts pointed out. So where would the rest of the money come from?\n\n“I think the money is going to come from a revved up economy,” Trump said. “I mean, you look at the kind of numbers we’re doing we were probably GDP of a little more than one percent and if I can get that up to three or maybe more we have a whole different ballgame. A whole different ballgame. And that’s what we’re looking to do.”\n\nRespected economists have, clearly and at volume, called Trump’s growth projections excessively optimistic. But the friendly crew at Fox & Friends were apparently too polite to bring that up, as Trump moved on to outline other, vague sources of potential income.\n\n“We’re going to be doing things having to do with other countries, because we’re treated very, very unfairly, when we help them, even militarily, we’re going to ask for a form of reimbursement,” he said.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\n“Right now we have countries where we’re taking care of their military, we’re not being reimbursed, and they’re wealthy countries. We have a lot of things happening, but we’re going to get the numbers way up and we’re going to get jobs back in our country.”\n\nTrump also claimed that “thousands -- and millions, actually -- of jobs” would be created now that his nominee to run the EPA is in place, because he will drop barriers to the “hundreds and hundreds of massive deals that are tied up with Environmental Protection.”\n\nThe idea that the EPA is holding industry back from creating “millions” of jobs is preposterous. Look at it this way: if regulatory barriers were suddenly dropped and the total number of people employed in the oil and gas extraction industry and the mining industry were instantly doubled, it wouldn’t create even half a million jobs. In fact, the entire $18 trillion U.S. economy created only 2 million jobs in 2016, a year of solid increases.\n\nBut even if his boss is unwilling to confront reality, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney tacitly acknowledged it on Monday, when he told reporters that federal agencies were being directed to prepare for a $50 billion cut to domestic discretionary spending.\n\n“It’s the president keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,” Mulvaney said. “We are taking his words and we turning them into policies and dollars.”"

    "text": "As he prepares for his major address to a joint session of Congress tonight, President Donald Trump in a rare display of humility gave himself an A-plus for effort and an A for achievement, but only a “C or C-plus” for explaining his policies to Americans.\n\n“My messaging isn’t good,” Trump explained during an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends program.\n\nRelated: Democrats Claim They Can Block Obamacare Repeal by Republicans\n\nThere is little doubt that with a threadbare 42 percent approval rating – the lowest of any president during his first quarter in office dating back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the early 1950s -- Trump has to find a better way to sell his hard edged “America First” economic, trade, defense and immigration policies that have heartened his political base and many independents but roiled the rest of the country.\n\nOther polls suggest that his most controversial proposals, including repealing and replacing Obamacare, building a wall along the southern border with Mexico, eliminating Wall Street regulations, and escalating the arrest and deportation of illegal immigrants – aren’t resonating with a majority of Americans, particularly Democrats and left-leaning independents.\n\nHowever, there is some good news for Trump and his image makers in a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll conducted among 1,000 adults Feb. 18-22: For all the consternation and turmoil he has generated in the first full month of his administration with fiery executives orders and blustery rhetoric, Trump’s essential message of change continues to appeal to a large segment of the electorate.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of Americans surveyed said that Trump would bring about “real change,” including 40 percent who say that it is “very likely” he would accomplish his goals.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nA plurality of Americans (48 percent) believe that Trump will bring about the right kind of change, which is good news for the new president after a rocky start and unprecedented street protests against his policies throughout the country. And while – not surprisingly -- 89 percent of Republicans interviewed said he will bring about the “right kind of change,” nearly half of independents agree with that notion.\n\nHowever, 23 percent of Americans – mostly Democrats -- believe Trump will bring about the wrong sort of change. And if Trump has any interest in trying to begin to unite a sorely divided country with his speech tonight, he needs to start listening to what that segment of the electorate has to say.\n\nThe following graphic from Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, first published by The Washington Post, clearly tells this relatively positive story for Trump."

    "text": "President Donald Trump loves his generals. (And he does view them as “his” generals.) In the first weeks of his presidency, he has stocked the top ranks of his defense and national security team with them, even replacing one general with another general when there was a sudden vacancy in the role of National Security Adviser.\n\nAt the same time, he is proposing a new spending plan that dramatically increases the Pentagon's budget in an effort to kick off what he promised would be “one of the greatest military buildups in American history.” He has promised major expansions of all branches of the armed forces, including a vastly expanded and hugely expensive buildup of the Navy.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Big Naval Buildup Could Cost $750 Billion Over 30 Years\n\nHe plans to finance this re-arming of America, in large part, by slashing the budget of other elements of the government, including the Department of State.\n\nThis dramatic redirection of spending, combined with Trump’s repeated promises on the campaign trail that he would “get tough” with America’s enemies, which included explicit vows to commit war crimes, such as targeting the families of the country’s enemies, reinstating the use of torture as an interrogation technique, and taking the natural resources of conquered countries, suggests a serious reorientation of US foreign policy toward war and away from the pursuit of peace through negotiation.\n\nDiscussing his budget proposal on Monday, Trump even seemed to pine for the days when the United States was fighting and winning wars. “We have to win. We have to start winning wars again. I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say we never lost a war. We never lost a war. You remember...some of you were right there with me, you remember, America never lost.”\n\nHe continued, “We never win and we don’t fight to win. We don’t fight to win. We’ve either got to win or don’t fight it at all.”\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nWe're now at the point where Trump’s dedication to building up the military at the expense of the civilian national security apparatus is even making the generals nervous. On Monday, 121 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals from all branches of the US military sent a letter to Congressional leaders pleading with them not to allow the defunding of the country’s diplomatic corps or of international aid efforts.\n\nExperience has taught them, they said, that “elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe.”\n\nThey added, “We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone – from confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater instability. There are 65 million displaced people today, the most since World War II, with consequences including refugee flows that are threatening America’s strategic allies in Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and Europe.”\n\nThe letter was copied to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster (the latter two being a retired Marine Corps general and a serving Army General respectively.)\n\nRelated: Budget Battle Looms as Trump Identifies Spending Cut Targets\n\nAmong the signatories were veteran officers who have served in key national security posts, like Army General Keith B. Alexander, the former director of the National Security Agency, and head of U.S. Cyber Command; Air Force General Michael V. Hayden, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Army General David H. Petraeus, who also ran the CIA and served as the commander of coalition forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n“The military will lead the fight against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of extremism– lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and hopelessness,” they wrote. “We urge you to ensure that resources for the International Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, one of Trump’s most common criticisms of other politicians was that they were “all talk, no action.” His bias toward action over words seems to be bleeding over into the realm of international relations, to the point that even professional soldiers view as problematic.\n\nRelated: Following Bannon’s Lead, Trump Blasts Media in Nationalist Speech at CPAC\n\nAt this time, it might be helpful for someone in Trump’s inner circle to point him toward the bust of Winston Churchill that he so ostentatiously returned to the Oval Office last month.\n\nThe former British Prime Minister was no stranger to the use of military force, and in 1954, then retired from politics, he visited the White House and delivered brief remarks at a luncheon. His exact words are unknown, but were memorably reported by The New York Times as a defense of diplomacy in the face of calls for military action: “To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.”"

    "text": "Senate and House Democratic leaders are optimistic that they can block the GOP’s move to repeal and replace the beleaguered Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nDuring a meeting with reporters at the National Press Club Monday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California claimed that the Republicans had lost their momentum following a week of angry protests at town hall meetings and marches throughout the country in opposition to dismantling Obamacare.\n\nRelated: New Report Warns Millions Could Lose Health Care Under GOP Plan\n\nWhile it is still too soon to say with certainty, Schumer and Pelosi said there are strong indications that GOP congressional leaders will not be able to muster even a simple majority in the Senate necessary to pass their legislation and send it to President Trump for his signature.\n\n“Republicans have not been able to pick off a single Democrat to support any of their plans,” Schumer said. “We have shown a united front, while the Republicans’ internecine warfare has been on full display. I believe the odds are very high we will keep the ACA. It will not be repealed.”\n\nTrump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other GOP leaders sought to rally governors, health insurance executives and others during meetings at the White House yesterday around the broad strokes of a plan that would replace Obamacare by 2018.\n\nThey reiterated their claim that Obamacare is in a “death spiral” because of soaring premiums, shrinking policy choices and more and more major insurers like Humana, Aetna and Blue Cross & Blue Shield pulling out of the ACA government-subsidized insurance market because of heavy losses. “Obamacare is a disaster and it’s only getting worse,” the president said. Ryan, meanwhile, told reporters outside the White House that “We’re going to give people choice and freedom, and that’s what a patient-centered health care system does.”\n\nRyan, a former House Budget Committee chair and policy wonk, has taken the lead in designing a GOP replacement plan that would repeal most of the ACA’s mandates, income-based tax subsidies and business and personal tax increases necessary to finance the program. He would replace them with a more market-oriented approach, including refundable, age-based tax credits to help cover premiums that would provide more assistance to older, wealthier Americans than younger, poorer consumers.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nRyan’s plan would also encourage the use of tax-exempt medical savings accounts, provide older, sicker people with coverage through state-operated “high risk pools” and gradually phase out expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people. It would also convert the traditional Medicaid program for 74 million low income people to block grants to the states to help control costs and limit the availability of coverage.\n\nHowever, Ryan’s plan is just one of many circulating on Capitol Hill and at the White House. And as time begins to run out for the Republicans to pull together and pass an approach that garners widespread support within the party, Trump spent part of the weekend conferring with Republican governors John Kasich of Ohio, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida on various alternative plans they have been promoting.\n\nKasich has proposed scaling back but not repealing some of the ACA’s more generous benefits -- including reducing the number services that insurers must provide in individual policies and tightening eligibility requirements. But like many of the other Republican governors whose states opted for expanded Medicaid, Kasich doesn’t want to see his constituents lose those hard-won and vital benefits.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nBy yesterday, the president voiced surprise at how difficult and complicated it is to draft a new health care plan – something former President Barack Obama and a Democratic majority spent the better part of two years trying to do before Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 – without the help of a single Republican.\n\n“Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” Trump said yesterday. He once again ruminated on how much easier it would be if he and the Republicans simply stepped back and allowed the ACA to collapse of its own weight, instead of rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the fray. In that way, he said, the Democrats would have to take all the blame while he and the Republicans could escape political responsibility in the 2018 mid-term election.\n\n\"Let it be a disaster, because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room -- and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama,\" Trump said in remarks to the National Governors Association. \"But we have to do what's right, because Obamacare is a failed disaster.\"\n\nTrump and the Republicans have a lot riding on success in passing budget reconciliation legislation that repeals major portions of Obamacare and replaces it with GOP-designed alternative within the next month or so – well past their original Jan. 27 deadline for pulling the legislation together. Trump on several different occasions told reporters that his administration was within days of unveiling replacement legislation that would simultaneously repeal and replace Obamacare, but each time the deadline slipped by.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nIn a sign of the Republicans mounting desperation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Republican leaders have concluded their best chance is to “set a bill in motion” and then gamble that rank and file members will conclude they have no choice but to support it. This “now or never” approach to force GOP lawmakers into line has been tried in the past by Democratic and Republican leaders with mixed success.\n\nIf they prevail in repealing Obamacare, then the Republicans will be on a roll, and some Democrats may have no choice but to join with them to fine tune replacement legislation that would do the least damage to their constituents. Refusing to join in would invariably mark their party as naysayers unwilling to address what most observers agree are serious flaws in the health insurance program.\n\nBut if they gamble and lose, Trump and the Republicans would suffer a humiliating setback that would be hard to explain away to their political base, after the Republicans gained control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nBecause Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, it would take the defection of just three moderate Republicans to block legislation dismantling Obamacare from passing, even under special budget reconciliation rules Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Ryan intend to use in both chambers to prevent a Democratic filibuster.\n\nAlready, a few Republicans including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have raised strong objections to some of the leading GOP replacement proposals, especially those that would phase out expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia or cut funding for Planned Parenthood – which would be called for in Ryan’s plan.\n\nPelosi and the Democrats would have a much steeper climb in trying to block the repeal of Obamacare in the House, where the Republicans hold a 247 to 188 seat advantage and GOP lawmakers for years have been promoting legislation to kill the healthcare program. However, the House Republican caucus is badly divided over how to proceed.\n\nFor one things, many of the 35 members of the arch conservative Freedom Caucus are demanding a complete repeal of Obamacare, expanded Medicaid and the taxes used to fund the program as the price for their support. But others are determined to preserve expanded Medicaid for low income people in their districts as well as some of the other more popular features of Obamacare.\n\n“Don’t underestimate the power of Medicaid,” Pelosi said in assessing the Democrats’ chances of blocking action in the House."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/28/How-Democrats-Can-Un-Rig-Party-and-Start-Winning-Again",
    "text": "Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was elected as Democratic National Committee chair over the weekend after remnants of the Obama coalition, frightened by Keith Ellison’s strident progressivism, mounted a campaign to stop his ascendancy. This has led leftists already burned by the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton wars to renew cries that the Democratic Party is rigged for the establishment and its continued love affair with special interests. (The fact that the DNC voted down a ban on accepting corporate money moments before electing Perez doesn’t mollify these sentiments.)\n\nI know Perez to be a progressive yet loyal soldier of the Obama years who did a lot of great work at the Labor Department within an acceptable range that didn’t include radical challenges to financial power. And the willingness of Perez’s backers — led by President Obama — to threaten party unity to keep Ellison out of the chair is a sad commentary. The obviously pre-arranged olive branch, with Perez appointing Ellison as deputy chair, could paper over these divisions, and the very presence of President Donald Trump certainly will, in the near term.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Spark a New GOP Split – or Maybe a Love Fest\n\nIf we want to talk about rigging elections, though, we shouldn’t look at the DNC. Its role is mostly irrelevant in that regard; it’s a party-building and fundraising organization. Other groups within the Democratic Party do dominate elections, bringing a rigid, stale sensibility to the issue of who can represent the leftward pole in our politics. And those organizations more credibly steer the debate Sanders fans are waging over how to change the country.\n\nI’m talking mainly about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the campaign arm for Democrats within the House of Representatives now chaired by Rep. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico. For decades now, no matter who has led it, the DCCC has been run on the principle that only a certain type of Democrat can win a House race. It anoints candidates well in advance of any election, gets involved in primaries, favors candidates with money and endorsements and discourages donors from giving to candidates they don’t like. Unlike in a high-profile presidential campaign, this preferential treatment can absolutely make the difference in who represents the party in House races.\n\nThis is all done largely out in the open. It’s called “candidate recruitment” and “electoral strategy.” Read the archives of Howie Klein’s indispensable Down With Tyranny blog and you’ll see this play out in election cycle after cycle. His chronicle of how Democrats have misfired consistently in Republican Darrell Issa’s California House district, which has been winnable for years, is a good primer.\n\nRelated: Key Question for Dems — Is the New Boss the Same as the Old Boss?\n\nThe strategy comes with fairly clear and open biases. To be seen as an attractive candidate by the campaign committees, one major attribute — maybe the biggest — is whether you are rich enough to self-fund the campaign, or have enough rich friends who can bankroll it for you. While not necessarily an ideological tactic, the life experience and worldview of a self-funding politician necessarily differs from a teacher or ironworker or community activist. There’s a comfort with power that goes along with wealth, a mindshare that is hard to overcome.\n\nNext, it’s seen as critical that you “fit” the district, based on a largely arbitrary left-right continuum. Fitting the district does not necessarily equal speaking to a district’s concerns, like a farm community dominated by agribusiness or a small business sector that cannot compete with big box stores. The local issues of local people are not part of the equation. It’s more about the candidate choosing from a grab-bag menu of “moderate” positions at odds with the Democratic platform, to prove some manner of independence.\n\nOther facts are less central to the DCCC’s thinking: backing core Democratic values, for example, or pre-existing support within the district or having lived in the district a long time (or ever). The DCCC consistently airlifts in its own candidates, big-footing the ones locals have endorsed but whom the Party has determined cannot win for whatever reason.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\nThese strategies play to the biases of consultants with their own set ideas about elections, which not coincidentally involve lots of advertising placement on which they make commissions. If they had a track record of success, maybe you could grudgingly overlook the inherent lean in their worldview. But this is the crew that oversaw the 2010 and 2014 electoral disasters, without using the more favorable 2012 and 2016 political environments to pick up many seats at all.\n\nLast November, Hillary Clinton won 23 House districts that Republicans still hold; in Pete Sessions’ 32nd district of Texas, Democrats didn’t even field a candidate. Stories of the DCCC ignoring seats where a candidate might have been successful are legion. The DCCC has even been slow to organize in the special election in Georgia to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, a district Trump barely won, though they’ve now paid for a handful of staffers there.\n\nThere’s an argument to make that the technical competence of the DCCC and its Senate counterpart, the DSCC, matters less than the national political environment come election time. Democratic dominance in a special election this weekend that decided control of the Delaware State Senate testifies to that. Newly energized activists wanting to stick it to Donald Trump can overcome the DCCC’s foibles.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare — Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nBut that means the work of the party committees matters even more. If a wave of anti-Trump sentiment can lift Democrats to victory, having candidates who are actually willing to tackle the nation’s biggest challenges is paramount. If, as in the Great Recession election of 2008, for example, anyone with a D in front of their name is poised to win, progressives must make sure that D doesn’t go to just anyone, but those who will do something meaningful with the privilege.\n\nWe have an uneasy concentration of wealth and power that has threatened liberty and democracy. The economy works for a narrow band of elites, not the broad class of citizens. A party of the left must represent those who want to counteract that, or else the governing debates when elections end will be nothing more than a sideshow, patches on a fraying system where Big Money wins regardless of the outcome.\n\nThere are small signs that the DCCC is becoming more responsive to the grassroots. Activists have grown restless with an ossified House leadership that isn’t making room for younger and more ideological members. State and local Democratic parties are being overrun with new energy and recruits. There is actual hope that a movement of engaged citizens can turn the Party around.\n\nBut it requires paying attention to the real choke points in Democratic politics, of which the DCCC is among the worst. Who sits in Congress when the next Democratic president speaks before a joint session will determine the success of their agenda. The time to build a coalition that will really address what’s held back our democracy begins today."

    "text": "Realizing President Trump’s goal of vastly strengthening America’s naval might won’t come cheap, and there are already signs that it is setting off an arms race on the high seas with an increasingly wary China.\n\nA just-released report by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office (GAO) on the Navy’s shipbuilding plans for the near future and the next 30 years estimates that raising the number of combat-ready vessels from the current 272 to “a fleet of 308 battle force ships” would cost a total of $566 billion dollars – or an average of $18.9 billion a year in 2016 dollars.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nThe CBO says that is “36 percent more than the historical average of $13.9 billion (in 2016 dollars) in annual funding for new-ship construction.”\n\nBut Trump has said he wants a much larger number of combat vessels – as many as 350 ships – and a Navy “force assessment” released last December calls for a fleet of 355. The Navy wish list would push the price tag of the three-decade program up to $25 billion a year, or $750 billion over the next 30 years – a 60 percent increase over the current level of funding for new aircraft carriers, submarines, surface combat vessels and support ships, according to Navy Times. Those numbers do not include the cost of littoral combat ships or training ships.\n\nTrump’s bid to rule the seas seems to be raising alarms in Beijing. China’s upcoming defense budget is expected to include significant new funding for the People’s Liberation Army Navy. Reuters says that given Trump’s “unpredictable approach on hot button issues, including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy.”\n\nReuters says that China does not break out how much it spends on its navy and the official figure for overall defense spending for 2016 – almost $140 billion – is thought to be understated. But last year, prior to the presidency of Donald Trump, Reuters said Chinese defense spending saw a rise of just 7.6 percent after a two decade string of double-digit increases.\n\nRelated: Why the Navy’s New Sub-Hunting Drone Is Raising Red Flags in China\n\nIn 2016, China commissioned 18 new ships, Reuters said, and recent reports indicate that it is building two new aircraft carriers to join the single one it has now – a retrofitted ship bought from Ukraine that is nowhere near comparable to any of the 10 carriers the U.S. has plying the seas.\n\nEach U.S. carrier has an air wing of some 60 aircraft, according to the CBO, and for most of the time period it analyzed, Navy plans call for 11 carriers to be operational.\n\nIn its report, the CBO pointed out that the Navy’s shipbuilding goals over the next four years – which include four more Gerald Ford class aircraft carriers -- cannot be achieved under the budget caps that were imposed by Congress in 2011 and don’t run out until 2021. The CBO estimates that to stay within the caps, the Navy would have to build 9 fewer ships than the 38 it envisions over that time period.\n\nThat suggests that to assemble the Navy that the President says is needed to reassert American military dominance, he will have to do a good deal of convincing on Capitol Hill."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/28/Schumer-Trump-s-Address-Congress-Less-Important-Other-Presidents",
    "text": "A little more than 24 hours before President Trump is set to deliver the first major speech to Congress of his young presidency, the two top Democrats in Washington held a joint press conference that seemed almost designed to get under the presidential skin.\n\nOffering what they billed as a “prebuttal” to Trump’s address to Congress tomorrow night, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke to reporters for an hour at the National Press Club. Their remarks, delivered at a time of day that will assure they are still fresh fodder for tonight’s cable news broadcasts, were laden with belittling, even insulting language suggesting that the president is accomplishing little, breaking promises, and failing in his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Budget Battle Looms as Trump Identifies Spending Cut Targets\n\nDuring the Obama administration, there was no shortage of Republican press conferences attacking the president, sometimes in personal, petty ways. It was the same way with Democrats under President Bush.\n\nHowever, those press conferences were aimed not at the president, but at the GOP base. Presidents Obama and Bush were practiced at letting attacks and insults slide off them. In the Trump era, though it’s impossible to dismiss the idea that Pelosi and Schumer were taking direct aim at a president who can’t seem to ignore or forget a slight, and they dealt them out by the bushel on Monday afternoon.\n\n“Thus far he’s demonstrated himself to be a president of little impact and all too often the little he’s done seems to be a broken promise to working people,” Schumer said.\n\n“The first month of a Trump presidency is less of a bang and more of a whimper,” he continued. “Not much impact. But what he’s done so far has shifted the burden off of the special interests and the wealthy and onto working families.” Comparing the Trump administration to a bad restaurant, he said that for working Americans so far, “The portions are small, the food is terrible.”\n\nSchumer needled Trump over the Democrats’ ability to delay Senate confirmation of his cabinet picks, and the evident concern Republicans have about going through with repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “The odds are very high that we keep the ACA,” he predicted. “It will not be repealed.”\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nHe also ridiculed some of the actions that Trump and his administration have hailed as accomplishments. “They have undone a few regulations that were an afterthought of the Obama administration, but when the president signs them he makes it seem like they’re the greatest thing ever done,” he said.\n\n“Jobs continue to leave America despite the president’s boasts,” Schumer said, making mocking reference to Trump’s saving “one-half of one Carrier plant” in his intervention with the Indiana-based company last year.\n\nTrump’s withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade deal, he said, was simply an attempt to take credit for someone else’s accomplishment. The deal, he pointed out, was already dead before Trump took office.\n\nPelosi went after Trump for many of the personal traits that, during the campaign, Trump had insisted were superior, including his judgment and his intelligence. “The president’s reckless agenda and incompetent judgment are jeopardizing the security of our nation,” she said. She also suggested that he might not be capable of understanding the actual effects of his policies, such as planned budget cuts.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Deportation Plan Could Cost Hundreds of Billions of Dollars\n\n“I don’t even know if the president really understands the ramification of the cuts that he’s proposed,” she said at one point. Pelosi also hammered Trump on the suggestion, evidently infuriating to him, that he has been somehow compromised by Russian intelligence services.\n\nShe referred to the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn after he was said to have had improper contact with Russian officials, and to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who pressed FBI officials and other intelligence professionals to push back against the story in the media.\n\n“The American people deserve the truth,” she said. “What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?”\n\nBut it was Schumer who delivered the most stinging blow, suggesting that President Trump’s address to Congress will be less consequential than similar speeches delivered by his predecessors. “President Trump’s address to Congress is far less important than past presidential addresses because his speeches don’t indicate what he’s actually going to do,” he said.\n\nAgain, under other circumstances, many of these attacks would seem petty and pointless. But with Trump in the White House, they may be petty, but they definitely aren’t pointless. Democrats want to paint Trump as reckless and ego-driven, and there’s no better way to do that than by proving that he can be provoked into reactions that his predecessors in the Oval Office would never have considered."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/27/Mnuchin-Promises-No-Budget-Cuts-Social-Security-and-Medicare",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday affirmed his plans for a major build-up in defense, national security, and anti-crime efforts and vowed to offset those hundreds of billions of dollars in new costs by making deep cuts throughout the rest of the federal budget. But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says that Trump intends to make good on his campaign promise not to go after Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs.\n\nA Trump “budget blueprint” being released today would add $54 billion in defense and security funding next year while cutting that amount from \"lower priority programs\" across government agencies, according to the administration. That 10 percent increase would bring total spending on personnel, military hardware, and other defense contracts to at least $603 billion in fiscal 2018.\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\n“We’re going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people,” Trump told a gathering of the nation’s Republican and Democratic governors at the White House. “We can do so much more with the money we spend. With the $20 trillion in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt – something families all across the country have had to learn to do, unfortunately.”\n\nThe administration has signaled that this will mean, for example, deep cuts in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State Department, foreign aid, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, AmeriCorps, the Export-Import Bank and dozens of other long-standing and popular domestic programs.\n\nBut for the time being, at least, the Trump budget plan that the president will outline during his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night will leave untouched entitlement programs that constitute the major drivers of the nation’s mounting debt.\n\nTrump talked about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and pressing for an “historic” increase in defense spending to “rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America” during dangerous times abroad and at home.\n\n\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\n\n\nMnunchin declared over the weekend that talk of cutting or revamping Social Security and Medicare, the premier federal programs for providing income security and health care to seniors and retirees, is off the table as far as the president is concerned.\n\nAsked by Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business News on Sunday whether the Trump administration “needs to hit entitlements sooner rather than later” with the national debt on the cusp of $20 trillion, Mnuchin replied: “We are not touching those now. So don’t expect to see that as part of this budget. We are very focused on other aspects, and that’s what’s very important to us. That’s the president’s priority.”\n\nIf that proves to be the case, then Trump will have made good on a campaign promise to protect federal programs designed to help the elderly and low-income Americans from budget cuts. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Trump declared two days before the November election in Sioux City, Iowa. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago” to pay into the system.\n\nThis was Mnunchin’s strongest statement on the topic to date. The former Wall Street banker and hedge fund manager skirted describing the types of spending cuts the administration was preparing to make during his Senate confirmation hearings. However, conservative Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, insisted during his confirmations hearings that he would push for Social Security and Medicare reforms, according to The Hill.\n\nRelated: Budget Battle Looms as Trump Identifies Spending Cut Targets\n\nMulvaney in fact once called Social Security a “Ponzi schemes” that requires overhauling. And former GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the new secretary of health and human services, previously supported transforming Medicare into a voucher-type program for future recipients.\n\nPrecisely how Trump intends to mount a major buildup of the military, build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, bolster the ranks of border patrol and immigration agents, slash taxes and leave entitlements intact without driving up the debt even more remains to be seen.\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Fiscal Times last week that Trump’s “budgetary logic” is dangerously similar to that of the Reagan administration, which pursued a big defense buildup and tax cuts, only to touch off nearly two decades of struggle to contain rampant deficits -- including major cuts in social safety-net programs.\n\nHoward Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic Party leader, said today on MSNBC that for him and average Americans, Trump’s budget math “doesn’t make sense.”\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly warned that the government is on track to return to an era of massive, trillion-dollar-a-year deficits and historic levels of debt as a share of the national economy absent changes in the existing entitlement programs.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Deportation Plan Could Cost Hundreds of Billions of Dollars\n\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for low-income people accounted for nearly $1.8 trillion of the government’s $3.9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the CBO. Moreover, with the number of people 65 and over projected to increase by a third over the coming decade, Social Security and Medicare spending is slated to increase to 42 percent of total government outlays by 2027.\n\nThe leadership of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an anti-deficit group, has called on Trump to discuss the importance of the national debt during his first address to a joint session of Congress. “Not since Harry Truman has the national debt been so high as a share of the economy for a new president,” said former defense secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta, former Republican Indiana governor Mitch Daniels and former Democratic Rep. Tim Penny from Minnesota.\n\n“President Trump should use the power of the presidency during tomorrow’s address to talk about the danger our debt poses and begin to put a plan forward to fix it,” they added. “A comprehensive growth strategy will be aided by reducing waste and inefficiencies throughout the government, improving the regulatory environment, pursuing fiscally-responsible pro-growth tax reform, containing rising health care spending, and making Social Security solvent.”"

    "text": "After nearly two years of publicly complaining about China and other major U.S. trading partners getting the better of the deal when goods cross international borders, President Trump appears to be examining ways to strike back against what he calls unfair trade practices. Ironically, the route he is exploring appears to bypass a major international trade agreement designed to give governments a forum in which trade-related grievances can be adjudicated in a binding manner.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times and Business Insider, the administration is asking the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to draft a set of options for imposing economic penalties on China and other U.S. trading partners outside the formal channels created within the structure of the World Trade Organization.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism\n\nThe WTO, which formed in 1995 out of the post-World War II General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, defined a set of binding requirements on member countries that was meant to establish a framework for trade negotiations as well as a method for resolving potential disputes.\n\nThe U.S. was one of the key players in the development of the WTO and is a signatory to all of its relevant agreements, including the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU).\n\nAccording to the WTO itself, the obligations of member countries are clear: “The dispute settlement system is compulsory. All WTO Members are subject to it, as they have all signed and ratified the WTO Agreement as a single undertaking, of which the DSU is a part ... This consent to accept the jurisdiction of the WTO dispute settlement system is already contained in a Member’s accession to the WTO. As a result, every Member enjoys assured access to the dispute settlement system and no responding Member may escape that jurisdiction.”\n\nThe reason for the DSU’s existence, according to the WTO, is practically self-evident. “If Members were to act unilaterally, this would have obvious disadvantages that are well known from the history of the multilateral trading system … Things may spiral out of control and, unless one of the parties backs down, there is a risk of escalation of mutual trade restrictions, which may result in a ‘trade war.’”\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\nA move to impose unilateral sanctions or tariffs on countries like China as a response to what the president views as anti-competitive behavior would be yet another signal of the Trump administration’s disdain for the international order and the institutions that keep it functioning.\n\nThe administration has already demonstrated its contempt for broad international trade agreements by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations just hours after President Trump was sworn in.\n\nIn an appearance outside Washington last week, White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon called withdrawing from TPP “one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history.” The administration is now, he said, starting to think through a whole round of “amazing and innovative” bilateral trade relationships.\n\nAnd with regard to China in particular, Trump has surrounded himself with advisers advocating a very aggressive approach in which a trade war might be more of a feature than a bug.\n\nUniversity of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro has joined the administration to lead the newly-formed National Trade Council within the White House. Navarro, an economist with strong academic credentials but views that are well outside the mainstream of thought on trade policy, is the author of the book Death by China, which describes what Navarro sees as a slow strangulation of the U.S. economy by Chinese trade policy.\n\nRelated: Trump Has No South China Sea Strategy — and Needs One Fast\n\nLike some other trade hawks, Navarro has been among the critics of the WTO who see the dispute resolution system as sclerotic and biased toward Chinese interests.\n\nLast year Navarro and incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross co-wrote a white paper that touched on the way U.S. goods are taxed by other countries and seemed to suggest that the U.S. ought to threaten to leave the WTO entirely.\n\n“Donald Trump understands that the only way to correct this unfair tax treatment is for the US to use its status as the world’s largest economy, the world’s largest consumer, and the world’s largest importer to put pressure on the WTO to change this unequal treatment,” Navarro and Ross write. “Without the US as a member, there would not be much purpose to the WTO, but prior occupants in the White House have been unwilling to lead on this issue despite its significant negative impacts.”"

    "text": "Ever sign up for a magazine or maintenance service and then get surprised by a renewal charge that pops up on your credit card bill months later? Have you gotten frustrated when you can’t figure out how to cancel, or it’s too late to avoid the charges?\n\nIt’s called automatic renewal, and the practice increasingly is showing up in consumer contracts for all sorts of services and products, from home appliance maintenance and health club memberships to internet security software and subscriptions.\n\nRelated: How Much More Your Mortgage Could Cost as Interest Rates Rise\n\nDriven by consumer complaints, a growing number of states are stepping in to restrict the practice by requiring businesses to disclose their auto-renewal policies clearly and conspicuously up front, get customers’ express consent to renew before charging them, or give notice in writing about how to opt out before the cancellation deadline passes and they get charged for renewal.\n\nAt least 22 states impose requirements on some types of automatic contract renewals. And this year, legislation that would restrict their use has been introduced in at least eight states, including Kansas, Minnesota and Wyoming.\n\nThe laws vary. In some states, such as California and Oregon, they apply to most consumer contracts. They not only have specific disclosure requirements and cancellation notice instructions, but they also require companies to provide customers with easy ways of canceling, such as toll-free phone numbers and email addresses. In other states, such as New Hampshire and Arkansas, the laws target only specific types of businesses, such as health clubs or home security companies.\n\n“But their main goal is to make sure consumers are informed before they sign the contract and are aware of the terms and what it takes to stop the renewal down the road,” said Heather Morton, a legislative analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAdvocates for the requirements say they protect customers from unwittingly entering into self-perpetuating agreements and then getting stuck paying for something they don’t want.\n\nNew Jersey Assemblyman Daniel Benson calls auto-renewals “zombie contracts.”\n\n“They seem to never die. You see those charges and try to cancel, but you’re too late and it keeps repeating itself,” said Benson, a Democrat who for years has tried to pass an auto-renewal bill in his state and is sponsoring one again this year.\n\nBusinesses that oppose restrictions on auto-renewals, including cellphone and home security companies, direct marketers and magazine publishers, say they are unnecessary and burdensome. And, they say, the requirements can be a pain for customers who want seamless services without the hassle of frequently renewing contracts online or by mail.\n\nRelated: Millennials Aren’t Going Cashless -- but the End of Cash Is Coming\n\n“We are extremely customer-friendly and we do self-regulate,” said Rita Cohen, a senior vice president for MPA - the Association of Magazine Media, a trade association that has opposed auto-renewal bills in a number of states. “There’s no need for overly restrictive legislation.”\n\nCohen says auto-renewals are “extremely valuable” to consumers and magazine publishers because they ensure customers’ subscriptions aren’t interrupted. Creating state-by-state requirements makes compliance difficult for her industry, which does national promotions, she said. It’s also costly for publishers to have to continuously produce renewal notices.\n\nNew York Democratic Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, who sponsored bills to restrict auto-renewals in previous sessions and is trying again this year, said the restrictions would not be a big burden for companies — but any burden should be on them.\n\n“I’m not trying to do anything to hurt these businesses,” Dinowitz said. “But I believe the onus shouldn’t be on the consumer to say no, but on the company to convince the consumer to renew.”\n\nConsumer Complaints\n\nConsumer advocates say auto-renewals, also called “evergreen clauses,” aren’t bad in and of themselves because some customers prefer them out of convenience. But often, they say, contract language about auto-renewals is buried in the fine print. Consumers don’t explicitly give their permission before the contract is renewed and learn of a renewal only when they see a charge on their credit card statement. By then, it may be too late to cancel.\n\nRelated: Spend or Save Your Tax Refund? Here’s What Most People Are Doing This Year\n\n“It’s a very lucrative way of getting money out of consumers’ pockets without them actually being aware of it,” said Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League.\n\nLila McKinley, an attorney for Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection, said her state has a law restricting auto-renewals, but her office still gets complaints about them. Some consumers say that the language can be hard to find in contracts or that when they dial a number to cancel, “they can’t get in touch with a real, live person,” she said.\n\nAnother problem, consumer advocates say, arises when customers sign up for a “free trial” and forget about it, or don’t realize they’ll automatically keep getting charged after the trial period ends.\n\n“You’re lured by a free sample or reduced rates initially, whether for a service or a product. That’s the reason the consumer takes the bait,” said Richard Holober, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California. “Then the burden is on the consumer to figure out how to get out of it. The company, in a few months, has made its profit on a transaction that hasn’t been honest and up front.”\n\nMany industry officials say they already have a code of conduct when it comes to dealing with customers so new regulations are overkill.\n\nIn a memo opposing a New York bill last year, CTIA, the wireless communications industry’s trade association, wrote that its nationwide code, which requires carriers to disclose contract details at the time of sale, has helped consumers make informed decisions. It warned that passing restrictions in New York could limit consumers’ choice because they would threaten national regulations that allow companies to offer consumers greater wireless access at a lower cost. A patchwork of state regulations could limit consumers’ choices and increase their costs.\n\nThe Data and Marketing Association, formerly the Direct Marketing Association, another trade group that opposed the New York bill, said marketers should clearly disclose the terms and conditions of a contract and get clear, informed consent from consumers before auto-renewal billing.\n\nBut the group called the proposed restrictions unnecessary and costly, and said they would be “ignored by bad actors.” The bill included up-front disclosure requirements and cancellation notice instructions. It also had a provision that if a business continued providing a product to a consumer without getting his consent under an auto-renewal agreement, it would be treated as an “unconditional gift.”\n\nRelated: The Next Financial Bubble? Auto Loans Soar as Delinquencies Rise\n\nCourt Battles\n\nThe controversy over auto-renewal provisions hasn’t just played out in legislative chambers. It’s also moved to the courts.\n\nA number of companies have been sued over their policies by state attorneys general or in class-action lawsuits brought by consumers.\n\nIn 2014, Sirius XM Radio agreed to a $3.8 million settlement with attorneys general from 45 states and the District of Columbia for allegedly using misleading advertising and billing practices, including auto-renewals without customers’ consent.\n\nIn 2015, LifeLock, an identity theft protection company, reached a $2.5 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit that alleged its auto-renewal practices violated California’s consumer protection law.\n\nAnd last year, McAfee agreed to pay up to $80 million in two class-action lawsuits alleging the security software company had automatically renewed customers’ subscriptions at a higher price than promised.\n\nAll three companies denied the allegations in the lawsuits and did not admit fault.\n\nWhile those cases involved large companies that do business nationwide, squabbles over evergreen clauses also can be very local.\n\n“We’ve had complaints about everything from contracts with heating and air conditioning companies to people who run lawn services to exterminators,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Thomas Murt, a Republican who co-sponsored a bill in the 2015-16 legislative session to restrict the use of the clauses. The bill died in committee, but he plans to reintroduce it this year.\n\nMurt said the requirements that he seeks to impose on businesses would be “pretty milquetoast.” He wants any auto-renewal clauses in contracts to be in big, bold print and for companies to notify consumers about renewals 30 to 60 days beforehand so they can cancel.\n\n“I don’t see how what we’re trying to do is an unfair burden on any business owner,” Murt said. “We are defending the honor of consumers here.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

    "text": "Space may be the final frontier, but it is also fast becoming another potential battlefield where America must be prepared to defend itself against any and all adversaries.\n\nRelated: Game of Drones - The Air Force Ramps Up Video Game Warfare\n\nThat was the message in a recent Defense News op-ed by two Air Force generals -- Dave Goldfein, the service’s chief of staff, and Jay Raymond, chief of the U.S. Air Force Space Command. They quoted another general, John Hyten, head of the U.S. Strategic Command (guardian of the nuclear arsenal), who has said that “there is no such thing as a war in space, there is just war, it’s with an adversary and if it extends into space we have to figure out how to fight it.”\n\nAs if on cue, the global military information site IHS Jane’s 360 reported late last week that Russia plans to arm some of its MiG-31BM interceptor aircraft with anti-satellite weapons. “A new missile is being developed for this aircraft capable of destroying targets in near-space,\" a Russian Aerospace Forces squadron commander said on Zvezda TV, a channel run by the Russian Defense Ministry, according to Jane’s.\n\nOne major reason that defending satellites and space-based systems has become so imperative is that the Air Force is relying more and more on attack drones, which are controlled from afar through satellite links. Drones also use satellite-based GPS to relay their positions to ground control.\n\nRelated: More Killer Drones, Please: The Air Force Places a $371 Million Order\n\nAs retired Air Force Major General James Poss wrote recently, “Beyond line of sight (BLOS) data links [have] revolutionized air power.” And the BLOS drones are getting more powerful.\n\nThe Air Force plans to replace its fleet of MQ-1 Predator drones with MQ-9 Reapers by 2018, according to UPI. The Reaper has a 3,750-pound payload capacity vs. 450 pounds for the Predator, a 50,000-foot flight ceiling vs. 25,000, and can cruise at about 230 miles per hour vs. 84 miles an hour. Reapers cost almost $15 million apiece.\n\nGenerals Goldfein and Raymond laid out a three-part strategy the Air Force is pursuing: enhancing its ability to spot threats and “control space assets;” “strengthening partnerships across the Department of Defense and intelligence community” to defend space systems; and building on the Interagency Combined Space Operations Center that was set up last year in Colorado.\n\nWar in space, the generals wrote, is “no longer just the stuff of science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury. In space, we must be able to detect threats early … and respond so decisively that no foe is tempted to raise a weapon in anger.”"

    "text": "Tomorrow night, President Trump is scheduled to make a major policy speech to Congress in which he is expected to offer an opening gambit in the budgeting games likely to occupy Congress for much of the next several months. The proposals he puts forward will force many in Washington, including Trump himself, to confront some uncomfortable realities.\n\nAccording to news reports over the weekend, primarily from The New York Times, Trump is planning to propose a major increase to the Defense Department’s budget, in line with his promise last week to oversee “one of the greatest military buildups in American history.”\n\nRelated: A Military Buildup and Big Tax Cuts: Is the Debt Set to Soar Under Trump?\n\nThe decision to greatly increase the Pentagon’s budget means one of three things has to happen in order to cover the costs: the Treasury could borrow more money, increasing the national debt; Congress could raise taxes to offset the increased Defense spending; other federal programs could be slashed.\n\nOver the weekend, Congressman Jim Jordan, an influential leader of the House Freedom Caucus, appeared on ABC and made it plain that option number one, increased borrowing, was off the table.\n\n“We’ve got to pay for these things,” he said when asked about how to handle Trump’s budget request. “We make this job way too complicated.”\n\nJordan’s wing of the party is substantial enough to block legislation in the House of Representatives unless Republican leadership can bring a large number of Democrats along, and it has shown, in the past, willingness to thwart the wishes of GOP leadership.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Deportation Plan Could Cost Hundreds of Billions of Dollars\n\nGiven the adamant opposition to tax increases among Republicans in general, the only option that remains is major spending cuts elsewhere, and according to the Times and The Wall Street Journal, that’s where Trump will go looking for the cash he wants to send to the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to those reports, the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are both facing the prospect of tens of billions in spending reductions, though it is unclear how the burden would be divided. The EPA’s budget, for example, was only $8.1 billion in 2016. The State Department’s budget was $51 billion, already dramatically lower than in previous years.\n\nAt the Center for Economic and Policy Research, economist Dean Baker points out that if the EPA is really expected to give up “tens of billions” in spending, presumably over the traditional 10-year budget window, it would likely represent at least a 25 percent decrease in its overall budget.\n\nFor the State Department, the percentage would be lower but would come after a previous round of budget cutting. It would also be difficult to reconcile a major reduction in spending on the United States’ main vehicle for engaging other countries around the world at a time when the President himself insists that he “inherited a mess” on the global stage.\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nOther cuts in spending are expected to focus on social safety net spending. While Trump will likely avoid cuts to the biggest-ticket items in the budget, like Medicare and Social Security, which he promised not to touch, other programs, like food aid to the poor and other assistance programs could face reductions.\n\nAny move to increase defense spending would require Congress to do away with the sequester imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed across-the-board spending reductions in equal measure on Defense and non-Defense spending.\n\nWhile many Congressional Republicans likely wouldn’t be bothered by changing the rules to allow more spending on the Pentagon and less on domestic priorities, the Democrats will surely focus what little leverage they have on trying to protect the social safety net."

    "text": "As pressure mounts on the Trump administration and congressional GOP leaders to come up with a replacement for Obamacare that won’t lead to huge losses in health care coverage for Americans, a new study presented at the National Governors Association over the weekend suggests that millions would be hurt under an emerging House GOP plan.\n\nThe analysis prepared by the health research firm Avalere Health and the consulting firm McKinsey and Company doesn’t offer nationwide projections for declines in coverage if the House Republican plan were approved by Congress as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. However, the analysis -- first reported Saturday by VOX -- indicates that there could be reductions of 30 percent to 50 percent in the number of individual market enrollees based on hypothetical state models. As it stands, the average retention rate of Obamacare insurance is 76-80 percent or a 16- 20 percent drop annually from signup to paying for premiums.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk Passing New Health Bill by Defunding Planned Parenthood\n\nStill, if those projections are extrapolated nationwide, it suggests that many of the 7.7 million people who obtained health coverage through the exchanges would no longer be able to afford it.\n\nPresident Trump last month boasted that the GOP replacement plan would provide health care coverage for “everybody,” but he and his senior advisers subsequently backed away from that. Republicans now say that their approach would provide “universal access” to affordable health care, but without guaranteeing that everyone currently enrolled can hang on to their insurance.\n\nThe White House on Sunday refused to say whether Trump would guarantee that the 7.7 million of Americans currently enrolled in Obamacare would continue to have coverage under a Republican substitute plan. During an appearance on the ABC News show This Week, Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “the goal is that we make sure that people don’t lose their coverage and we have to put a high priority on the people who need it most.”\n\n“But at the same time, we cannot survive under the current system,” she added. “We have to make a massive overhaul to the health care system in America . . . Nobody would argue that we’re on a path that we can maintain.”\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe House plan drafted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other GOP leaders may be formally introduced as early as Monday when Congress returns from a week-long recess. The past week has been marked by angry protests at town hall meetings and marches in Washington, D.C., and other cities involving Democrats and some Republicans who are fearful of losing their health insurance coverage.\n\nIf Trump and GOP leaders have their way, Congress will vote in the coming weeks to repeal key elements of the Affordable Care Act, including income-based tax subsidies for mostly low and moderate income people to help cover their premium costs and expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn place of Obamacare, the House plan would offer a series of free-market based measures, including age-adjusted tax credits that would benefit older, wealthier people far more than younger, poorer Americans. The Republicans would also gradually replace Medicaid with a program of block grants or per capita payments to the states that would save the federal government billions in the coming years but reduce coverage for lower-income people.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nThe consultants’ report to the governors outlines what would happen under the GOP approach in a hypothetical state that has 300,000 people enrolled in the individual health care market and expanded Medicaid for the poor. Enrollment in the individual market would decline by 30 percent, resulting in 90,000 people losing their coverage.\n\nAccording to the report, the loss of coverage would be far worse in states that refused to expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA. Many of those states are run by Republican governors or GOP-dominated state legislatures. The report presents a hypothetical model of a state with 235,000 currently enrolled in the individual market. It estimates that coverage would decline by 120,000 people or about 50 percent."

    "text": "In the boom-and-bust cycle of American political parties, the Democrats are at what can only be seen as the nadir of a bust. Completely shut out of power in the nation’s capital, and facing greatly diminished influence in state government, the party has spent the three and a half months since the wipeout of the November elections in an internal debate about how to move forward.\n\nOver the weekend, the first tentative answer to that question came with the election of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez to chair the Democratic National Committee. The party, despite broad repudiation at the polls in November, has decided not to stray too far from its current ideological orientation. A majority of the voting members of the DNC rejected a more leftward direction embodied by Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, who came in second in the balloting.\n\nRelated: The Deep Current of Fear at CPAC Turns to Palpable Paranoia\n\nPerez is closely associated with Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump in November, and for that reason was seen by some as too closely tied to a leadership structure that failed the party in 2016.\n\nOn Sunday, in appearances on multiple talk shows, Perez admitted that the party had failed to reach as broad an audience as it needed to in the election, and said he would pursue a new strategy of local engagement, promising to be active in “every ZIP code.”\n\n“We have to rebuild our party in the 50 states and territories and that’s exactly what we are going to do,” he told Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press. “We also have to redefine our mission. We not only elect the President of the United States, but we elect people from the school board to the Senate and everywhere in between.”\n\nOn ABC’s This Week, he promised to “build strong capacity to elect Democrats up and down the ticket.”\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nIt was more of the same on CNN: “We have to make sure we’re out there everywhere talking about how we’re the party of good job creation, the party of middle-class security, we’re the party of inclusion. we believe our diversity is our greatest strength. When we lead with these values I believe we succeed.”\n\nIf the promise to make the Democrats compete everywhere in the country sounds familiar, it should. In 2005, after George W. Bush was reelected to the presidency and Republicans solidified their hold on both the House and the Senate, a demoralized party turned to Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, whose “50-State” strategy helped the party rebound, taking control of both Houses of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008.\n\nIn his first move as DNC chair, Perez reached out to Ellison, who accepted the offer to serve as Deputy Chairman of the group. They publicly embraced on stage at the party gathering in Atlanta in an effort to show that any difference had been put aside.\n\nAfter President Trump used Twitter to attack the DNC leadership race as “rigged” -- a tactic he used during the Democratic primary to try to aggravate the dissension between Clinton supporters and those backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Perez shot back:\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\n“Our unity as a party is our greatest strength, and it’s his worst nightmare.”\n\nBut just how unified the party really is remains to be seen. In an interview on CNN Sunday Sanders, whose strong primary performance has made him a major power broker in the party despite his status as a registered Independent, was notably cautious in his statements about Perez. He had been a vociferous Ellison backer before the election.\n\n“Right now Tom Perez has a real opportunity in his hands and I hope he seizes it,” he said. “And that is to understand that, in fact, the way the Democratic party has been run for decades has not worked. We need a total transformation.\n\n“We have to open up the party to working people, to young people, and make it crystal clear that the Democratic Party is going to take on Wall Street it’s going to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, it’s going to take on corporate America that is shutting down plants in this country and moving our jobs abroad abroad.”\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nHe pointed out that he had attended a rally of 5,000 people in heavily Republican Kansas on Saturday, and that there had been 150 other Democratic rallies across the country that same day. The job of the DNC, he said, “is to motivate the grassroots.”\n\nHowever, when Sanders was asked by Jake Tapper if he would share his massive database of supporter emails and other information gathered during his campaign, he waffled. In the end, he left the impression that he would be making decisions on which Democratic candidates to support on an individual basis, rather than handing over his supporter list to the DNC wholesale.\n\nThe implication is that he is concerned Perez will turn out to be more of the same thing the Democratic establishment has been offering for the past eight years.\n\nAnd if that is Sanders’ worry, it’s also Republicans’ hope. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, former Trump campaign manager and occasional surrogate Corey Lewandowski called Perez’s election, “More of the same from the Democratic Party, which is what caused them to lose the presidential election"

The apolitical statuette has been clutched by many a winning hand railing about this cause or that outrage since the polarizing days of the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 2003 when Michael Moore won an Oscar for his documentary “Bowling for Columbine,” he used his acceptance speech to blast President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, saying, “We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons…. We are against this war, Mr. Bush! Shame on you, Mr. Bush! Shame on you!”\n\nRelated: Factbox: Key Nominations for the 2017 Oscars\n\nThat might have been the most politically charged moment in the history of the Academy Awards, which has seen Vanessa Redgrave talk about “Zionist hoodlums;” Bert Schneider, producer of the anti-Vietnam War documentary “Hearts and Minds,” read a message from the Viet Cong; and Best Actor Sean Penn, who won for the film “Milk,” speak out in favor of same-sex marriage in 2009.\n\nMoore said what a lot of other celebrities – and indeed a great many everyday Americans – were thinking. But it was one man’s rage.\n\nTonight’s entire Academy Awards ceremony will be conducted against a backdrop of protests against President Trump and his policies.\n\nUnited Talent Agency, one of the big guns of Tinseltown with some 300 agents, canceled its Oscar party and held a rally outside its headquarters on Friday to protest Trump’s immigration policies. It also pledged $250,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee, which aids refugees.\n\nAlso on Friday, directors of the five movies nominated for Best Foreign Language Film issued a joint statement “denouncing the rise of fanaticism and nationalism in the United States and beyond,” according to The New York Times.\n\nRelated: Following Bannon’s Lead, Trump Blasts Media in Nationalist Speech at CPAC\n\nAnd speaking of The Times, in a not-so-subtle response to Trump’s attacks on the press – including a tweet in which he called The Times, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN fake news and the enemy of the American people – the newspaper of record will run a commercial during the Oscar telecast that talks about what “the truth” is.\n\nThe spot, which cost $2-2.5 million if it is in line with the rates Ad Age says are being charged for 30 seconds of Oscar airtime, has a tagline that will be part of a larger campaign. It reads: “The Truth. It’s more important now than ever.”\n\nRatings for last year’s Oscars were at an eight-year low, but the expected fireworks could spark viewership tonight. If so, Hollywood will have only one person to thank: America’s ratings-obsessed President."

    "text": "Considering the circumstance, you would have expected the overarching theme of the Conservative Political Action Conference held late last week outside Washington to have been one of triumph. For the first time in more than a decade, Republicans hold both houses of Congress and the White House, with a solid chance of maintaining that grip on power for at least four years.\n\nBut while there was plenty of back-slapping and congratulations over the results of the November elections, the theme that ran through the conference like a major artery branching off into panel after panel was not happiness, but fear.\n\nRelated: Following Bannon’s Lead, Trump Blasts Media in Nationalist Speech at CPAC\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, speaker after speaker, on panel after panel, warned the audience of political activists and college students that they should be very, very afraid. The message came from the very top of the Republican Party when President Trump appeared Friday to attack the media as the “enemy of the people” and talk up his executive orders on immigration and deportation.\n\n“We’re getting bad people out of this country. People that shouldn’t be [here] whether it’s drugs or murder,” he said. “We’re also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.”\n\nSpeaking about terror attacks in Europe, he said, “Take a look at what’s happening to our world folks. We have to be smart. We can’t let it happen to us.”\n\nBut a lot of speakers on the agenda seemed to think it was already too late.\n\nCPAC organized not one, but two panels on the topic “When Did WWIII Begin?” giving a forum to people like Clare Lopez of the Center for Security Policy, who insisted that the US is already riddled by shadowy Islamist infiltrators affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nIslamist front groups, she said, are operating in our high schools and middle schools, and US courts are already being converted to Islamic Sharia law.\n\n“Our government and national security are...so deeply penetrated by the Muslim Brotherhood,” she said. “The Muslim Brotherhood and some of its front groups are training our local police and sheriff’s departments and some of those police and sheriff’s departments are turning around and training local Muslim Brotherhood front groups. How’s that going to work out?”\n\nShe urged attendees to take action against the plot to “insinuate Sharia gradually, stealthily into our society.”\n\nAnother speaker, author Trevor Loudon, warned that the people protesting the Trump administration are part of a vast Muslim-Communist conspiracy that dates back to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\n\n“The people behind these movements are professional revolutionaries they are allied to the Cubans, they are allied to Iran, they are allied to the Palestinian radicals and some of them are even allied, to this day, to Putin’s Russia,” Loudon said.\n\nRelated: The Conservative Conundrum: What to Do About the Alt-Right?\n\nThe executive director of the American Conservative Union, which puts on CPAC, even warned that the movement itself has been penetrated by dangerous outsiders.\n\nIn a speech rejecting the philosophy of the “Alt-right” political movement, Dan Schneider warned, “There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks. We must not be duped; we must not be deceived.”\n\nCalling the movement a “hate-filled left-wing fascist group” he said they have hijacked the term “Alt-right” “because they want to deceive the media and they want to deceive you all about what they stand for so that they can try to become normalized and we must not allow them to become normalized. They are not a part of us. They stole that term specifically to confuse us.”\n\nBut the pièce de résistance of fear-mongering arrived when National Rifle Association front man Wayne LaPierre took the stage Friday afternoon. It’s something of a CPAC tradition to have LaPierre come to the microphone and try to scare the hell out of everybody, and he did not disappoint.\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nBeginning with a riff on the protests that followed Trump’s election victory, LaPierre plunged into a paranoid narrative of coming violence against conservatives, delivered just a decibel or two lower than a shout.\n\n“The left’s message is absolutely clear,” he said. “They want revenge. You’ve got to be punished. They say you’re what’s wrong with America and now you’ve got to be purged.”\n\n“Right now we face a gathering of forces that are willing to use violence against us. Think about it. The leftist movement in this country right now is enraged. Among them and behind them are some of the most radical political elements there are. Anarchists. Marxists. Communists and the whole rest of the left-wing socialist brigade. Many of these people literally hate everything America stands for.”\n\n“They’re angry. They’re militant, and they’re willing to engage in criminal violence to get what they want.”\n\nRelated: Is Steve Bannon’s View of America’s Destiny a War Against Radical Islam?\n\nMaking matters worse, he said, is a “national media machine” that “dumps gasoline on simple political disagreement to turn it into cultural IEDs.”\n\nA particular highlight was when LaPierre pined for the days when people who leaked information to the press could be hunted down and executed. “A hundred years ago, if you eavesdropped and published the affairs of the head of state you would have been tracked down and hanged for treason,” he said.\n\nJudging from the crowd’s reaction, the summary execution of a journalist or two would have been just fine with some of them."

    "text": "Details of the House Republicans’ proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act leaked out late last week, including some that are certain to spark a political firestorm on Capitol Hill.\n\nMany aspects of the House proposal for dismantling the taxpayer-subsidized health insurance program already are widely known, particularly the elimination of the unpopular individual mandate requiring people to purchase insurance or pay a penalty, tax credit subsidies based on an individual’s income, and hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax increases aimed primarily at upper middle-income earners, the wealthy and businesses.\n\nRelated: A First for Obamacare: Majority of Americans Now Support It\n\nThe latest version of the House GOP plan disclosed by Politico on Friday would also gradually phase out expanded Medicaid coverage for able-bodied low-income people in 31 states and the District of Columbia by 2020, convert the regular Medicaid program to a block grant state system, and provide states roughly $10 billion a year to create so-called high-risk pools for older and sicker people.\n\nThe Republicans would preserve some elements of Obamacare, including allowing children to stay on their parents’ health care plan until age 26 and allow people to sock away far more in their tax-exempt health savings accounts than the law currently allows.\n\nSome portions of the plan would take effect immediately upon passage of the legislation while others would take until 2020 to implement.\n\nBut precisely how House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders go about raising revenues to replace the Obamacare taxes and underwrite the cost of a replacement plan -- including premium subsidies and incentives to the insurance industry to stay in the market -- are likely to spark resistance from many Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nHere are a few of the highlights of the House GOP plan to replace Obamacare:\n\nIn place of the Obama taxes, the GOP replacement plan would be financed by limiting federal tax breaks on generous health care plans that employees obtain through their employers. The tax exclusion costs the federal government an estimated $260 billion in income and payroll taxes in 2017, which makes it the single largest tax expenditure. The Republicans would cap the tax exemption for workers paying premiums on high-end health care policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans would preserve the ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions in one form or another, but they will impose a “continuous coverage exclusion” to protect insurers from excessive losses.\n\nIn place of Obamacare’s income-based tax subsidies that help low and middle-income people the most, Republicans would create “refundable” tax credits that vary by age and help older Americans the most. The tax credit would be stepped, beginning with $2,000 a year for people under the age of 30, and would increase by increments of $500 for each successive age group. The highest annual credit -- $4,000 – would go to people 60 and older.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help relieve insurance companies saddled with risk pools top heavy with older and sicker people, the GOP plan would provide states with a total of $100 billion over the coming decade to provide coverage to these people who may have trouble acquiring policies in the individual market. Whether that would be nearly enough to meet the cost is a point of contention.\n\nInsurers complain that many people wait until they are sick to purchase health insurance instead of when they are healthy and not in need of costly medical attention. The House GOP proposal includes penalties for individuals who fail to maintain continuous coverage. If they permit their insurance to lapse and then decide to re-enroll, they would be hit with a 30 percent boost in premiums for a year.\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\nA major wild card in the unfolding debate was the House leadership’s decision to include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood and other health organizations that provide abortions, according to The Hill. The one-year ban on Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood has long been sought by congressional Republicans and anti-abortion forces and would be a major victory for them.\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides sexual and reproductive health care, education, information, and outreach to 2.5 million women and men in the United States every year. About three percent of all Planned Parenthood health services are abortion related, according to the organization, but federal dollars cannot be used to fund those services.\n\nStill, anti-abortion activists argue that all funding for Planned Parenthood is fungible, and they want to make sure federal funding doesn’t indirectly facilitate abortions.\n\nAccording to The Hill, the Republicans would have a tough time passing Obamacare repeal and replace legislation if it includes a ban on Planned Parenthood funding. The Republicans hold a slender 52 to 48 majority in the Senate, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said last week she would not vote for any repeal that defunds Planned Parenthood.\n\n“Taxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health care services that Planned Parenthood provides,” she said. It would take the defection of just three Senate Republicans to halt the repeal and replace movement in its tracks."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Military-Buildup-and-Big-Tax-Cuts-Debt-Set-Soar-Under-Trump",
    "text": "With ambitions to more than match the Reagan-era military buildup, President Donald Trump and his advisers are preparing a budget plan calling for huge spending increases on defense while cutting domestic programs deeply.\n\nTrump last month ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran. He is also calling for a major buildup of all four branches of the military, including more troops, jet fighters, ships and other weaponry.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\nTrump this week mentioned the importance of reining in a national debt fast approaching $20 trillion, and he lectured senior White House economic advisers that “we need to do a lot more with less” in his first comments about the budget in advance of the release of his proposals by mid-March.\n\nHowever, he also indicated that a balanced budget was unrealistic for the time being as he tries to reconcile his fiscal responsibility rhetoric with campaign pledges to slash taxes by trillions of dollars, build a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile long southern border, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts and bulk up the military.\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a one-time policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said on Friday that Trump’s “budgetary logic” is dangerously similar to that of the Reagan administration, which pursued a big defense buildup and tax cuts, only to touch off nearly two decades of struggle to contain rampant deficits -- including major cuts in social safety-net programs.\n\n“If history repeats itself, the beginning of the Trump administration will be the high water mark for deficit spending, and then the equilibrating political forces will set in,” he said. “It seems like a formula for rising government spending, falling government revenues and much larger deficits – on top of large existing deficits.”\n\nRelated: Why a Small Interest Rate Hike Means a $50 Billion Hit to the Federal Budget\n\nLast month, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that after seven years of declines, the federal budget deficit is projected to surge again and will add nearly $10 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculated last year that Trump’s corporate and individual tax cuts and spending initiatives would add $5.3 trillion more to the national debt in the next ten years.\n\nAlthough much of this is still in the planning stages, the new administration is likely to ask Congress to raise spending caps to provide an additional $30 billion to $40 billion for defense in the current fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30, and $54 billion more next year. That would bring total spending on personnel, military hardware and other defense contracts to at least $603 billion in fiscal 2018, according to Justin Bogie, senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut even that massive figure – one that would eclipse defense spending by President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s – doesn’t tell the entire story. Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress will likely approve another $74 billion of emergency spending in 2018 from a special Overseas Contingency Account that has been used finance U.S. combat operations in the Middle East. Those funds don’t need to be offset by corresponding spending cuts in other parts of the budget and will directly add to the deficit.\n\nAt the same time, Trump and his advisers are expected to offset some of that increased defense spending by slashing non-defense discretionary spending by as much as $54 billion next year. This would involve lowering the domestic program spending ceiling that was set under the 2011 Budget Control Act from $516 billion to $462 billion.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that an Office of Management and Budget “hit list” has targeted nine long-standing programs with strong Democratic support, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities.\n\nBut even if all of those programs were eliminated, it would only save about $2.5 billion a year – a relative drop in the bucket compared to all of Trump’s spending that needs to be offset.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, which is closely allied with the Trump administration, has proposed scores of other cuts that would save billions more – including funding for National Infrastructure Investment (TIGER) grants, technology innovation, Department of Energy loan programs, and other business incentive programs that conservative critics dismiss as “crony capitalism.”\n\n“I think the real highlight will be on the discretionary spending side,” Bogie said in an interview. “You’re going to see a big plus-up in defense to pay for a lot of the campaign promises that Trump put out there. You’re going to see a big slash to a lot of these non-defense programs that a lot of people like and that have been funded for many years to pay for that.”\n\nIndeed, Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told The New York Times yesterday that he is worried “that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for low- and moderate-income families.”\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nBut fiscal conservative groups -- wary that Trump and his advisers may be leading the country into a renewed era of trillion-dollar-a-year budget deficits comparable to the red ink that flowed during the worst of the Great Recession -- say the new president must seriously address rising entitlement costs.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said on Thursday that Trump’s first budget “will tell us just how serious he is about taking on our record-high national debt.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Tax-Free-Bonds-Get-Second-Look-Trump-Eyes-Infrastructure-Plans",
    "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — Structures built with municipal bonds stand out in this city. There is the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center, and new parking garages for a revitalized restaurant and apartment district. Sleek, futuristic water towers loom on the edge of town and new modern pumps hum at the water plant where the oldest structures date to 1906.\n\nNationwide, the “muni bond” market has funded $1.65 trillion worth of projects for cities and other governments over the past decade. The borrowed money has paid for schools, roads, water and sewer systems, airports, bridges and other vital infrastructure.\n\n“These aren’t shiny baubles. These are essential infrastructure,” said Democratic Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, who is in his second term. “This is a sacrosanct part of our taxing policy that has been in existence since 1913.”\n\nBut some Republicans on Capitol Hill want to end the tax-exempt status of muni bonds as part of broader changes to the federal tax code. That has many state and local officials worried.\n\nA city’s ability to borrow depends on investors’ willingness to lend it money by purchasing bonds. And the tax-exempt status of muni bonds is part of what makes them so attractive to investors, especially high-income taxpayers looking to reduce their tax bills.\n\nBut exempting the bonds from federal taxes is projected to cost the U.S. Department of the Treasury as much as $617 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Tax Foundation, an independent tax analysis group. To many in Washington, recouping that money makes the tax exemption a tempting target.\n\nRelated: U.S. infrastructure legislation back on Congress' radar\n\nU.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, said at a Heritage Foundation event in December that he thinks there’s “merit” to eliminating the deduction as part of a broader tax policy makeover that would lower rates. “The added benefit here is that the federal tax code will no longer subsidize higher taxes at the local level,” Brady said.\n\nHouse Republicans released a tax policy blueprint last year that proposed eliminating most itemized deductions, including those taken for interest earned on municipal bonds. The proposal would keep intact deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving. They are now drafting a new version of the plan.\n\nA Meeting With Trump\n\nEven though they are called “municipal” bonds, states and other entities such as school districts and water authorities also rely on them. In 2016, there were $423.8 billion in new municipal bond sales, which include bonds issued by state authorities, water and sewer districts, local authorities, municipalities, counties, and colleges and universities.\n\nThe tax-free bonds come in three varieties. Most municipal bonds used to finance infrastructure projects are “general obligation” bonds, which means the governmental body that issues them puts its “full faith and credit” behind them. In other words, the city or county issuing the bonds pledges that its taxpayers will pay them off, no matter what happens. Cities and counties also issue “revenue bonds,” which they pay back using fees, such as tolls or public utility fees. Then there are “private activity” bonds, which are used mostly for housing and are secured by mortgages.\n\nShortly before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Benjamin and other mayors of cities large and small met with the incoming president, who assured them that he opposed taxing any of the types of bonds. “He said he understood and would be fully supportive” of the tax-free bonds, said Larry Jones, assistant executive director of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors. “However, we have yet to see how he would treat tax-exempt bonds in any budget proposal or tax reform proposal. We’ve been making our case on the Hill.”\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump’s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nGovernors also have expressed support for keeping the bonds tax-exempt. “Municipal bonds remain a critical tool to financing the construction or improvement of schools, streets, highways, hospitals, bridges, water and sewer systems, ports, airports and other public works,” the National Governors Association said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nDespite Trump’s assurances, muni-bond supporters have reason to be wary. During the presidential campaign, Trump’s economic advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross (since nominated to be secretary of commerce) questioned the wisdom of relying on tax-exempt bonds to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, as Trump has pledged to do. Instead, they suggested awarding federal tax credits to private firms to do the work. The tax credits might not replace municipal bonds, but they could crowd the market for infrastructure investing.\n\nA Traditional Target\n\nMuni bonds also came under fire during the last major revision of the federal tax code, in 1986.\n\nFrank Shafroth, director of the State and Local Government Leadership Center at George Mason University, was the National League of Cities’ director of federal relations during that debate. In a recent interview, he recalled the mad scramble to keep muni bonds tax-exempt as President Ronald Reagan and Republicans in Congress sought to eliminate or scale back the exemption.\n\nShafroth said awarding tax credits to private firms, as Trump’s economic advisers have proposed, “would not help with the vast number of projects” because, he said, those tax credits would most likely go to big, new projects, where they would be worth the most to private companies, not smaller efforts like road repair or school reconstruction.\n\nRelated: Trump criticizes billions in spending on U.S. air traffic control\n\nElizabeth Kautz, the mayor of Burnsville, Minnesota, just south of Minneapolis, emphasized that her city relies on municipal bonds to pay for street repaving and other basic maintenance, not to build shiny new stuff.\n\n“It’s not like you do it once and it’s done,” Kautz said. “There are always improvements and maintenance you have to do.” She said the city has a fiduciary responsibility to citizens to make these improvements and to issue the bonds to finance them.\n\nBut critics of muni bonds argue that they make borrowing money for infrastructure projects so easy that some cities and towns unnecessarily construct things. If the cities had to pay outright, there would be more discretion on what projects to fund, the theory goes.\n\nScott Greenberg, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said muni bonds may encourage cities to “overinvest in infrastructure, particularly if states and localities are also able to shift their tax burdens onto nonresidents.” That shift occurs when nonresidents buy the municipal bonds.\n\n“The subsidy goes to fund both projects that would have been funded no matter what, and projects that would not have been funded without the subsidy,” Greenberg said. “It’s the second category we should be at least a little wary of.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy."

    "text": "If you think about it, the Federal Government has an adjustable rate mortgage on its nearly $20 trillion debt. That can result in a pretty dramatic wallop to the budget when the fed raises interest rates even a quarter of a percentage point. That would cost a cool $50 billion—more than the entire budget of the State Department, including foreign aid.\n\nThat may not seem like a lot to a government with an annual budget of $4 trillion, but here’s what it could mean to the current administration, which has an oversized spending goal as well as an oversized reduction in programs and services.\n\nPresident Trump plans to boost spending on defense and border security while cutting taxes across the board. So where will the money come from? The following programs are on the president’s cut list, totaling $7.25 billion—not nearly enough to offset the cost of rising interest rates, let alone Trump’s new budget plan."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/24/Latest-JPMorgan-Lawsuit-Reminder-Why-Trump-s-Attack-Dodd-Frank-Dangerous",
    "text": "The New York State Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled on a major lawsuit by two insurance companies against JPMorgan Chase, agreeing that the bank violated investment agreements by making reckless purchases of subprime mortgages, causing losses of more than $1 billion.\n\nIn her ruling, judge Salliann Scarpulla said JPMorgan breached its investment agreements with the insurers — Ireland-based Ballantyne Re and Orkney Re II — but that the question of gross negligence remains unresolved. Therefore, she called for a trial, starting March 13, in which the plaintiffs will have to prove the bank acted with “intentional wrongdoing or reckless indifference” in order to receive damages.\n\nThe decision is the latest stain on JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, which has been hit with record-breaking fines for mismanagement and misleading investors, among other offenses, in the wake of the housing market collapse in 2008. It also serves as a timely reminder that the fallout from the financial crisis continues a decade later, yet it comes at a time when the Trump administration is looking to roll back some of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms that sought to rein in risky activity by large, systemically important banks.\n\nRelated: Overhauling Dodd-Frank May Not Succeed, but Also May Not Matter\n\nIn the suit filed on behalf of Ballantyne and Orkney, the judge agreed with the companies’ assertion that the bank ignored guidelines to invest no more than 50 percent of funds in risky subprime mortgage securities. In Ballantyne’s case, the bank invested as much as 90 percent of its funds in subprime and “alt-a” (between subprime and prime) securities. In Orkney’s, the total reached 77 percent.\n\n“Basically they built a house of cards,” said a source close to the case. “If you’re wrong, the consequences are devastating.”\n\nIn the court document, JPMorgan denies it committed gross negligence, asserting among other factors, that the insurers did not object to the investments it made on their behalf for a period of 90 days, thereby waiving the right to legal recourse.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Aim at America's Consumer Watchdog\n\nThe current suit largely mirrors a July 2015 case in which JPMorgan paid $388 million to the Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund and other investors who accused the bank of misleading them about the quality of mortgages underlying securities it issued in 2007. JPMorgan settled the suit without admitting wrongdoing.\n\nCritics of the bank say these and other cases belie the conventional storyline that surrounded JPMorgan in the wake of the crisis, which held that CEO Jamie Dimon had the foresight to shed investments in the mortgage-backed securities market when most of his competitors did not. In this “last bank standing” version, Dimon came to the rescue of the banking system, buying a faltering Bear Stearns and the remains of Washington Mutual after the largest U.S. thrift failed.\n\nBut while JPMorgan was wisely unloading its exposed position to subprime mortgages, the manager in charge of the Ballantyne and Orkney accounts was staying the course in the subprime market. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit and other critics say JPMorgan applied its foresight selectively, protecting its own investments more than those of its clients. They say failures of execution at the mid-level were validated by an absence of oversight at the top.\n\nRelated: Why JPMorgan’s Risk Management Failed\n\n“This case [Ballantyne and Orkney] presents a situation where, as it typically does, JPMorgan Chase put its own interests ahead of the interests of its customers,” said Helen Davis Chaitman, a New York trial attorney and co-author of J.P. Madoff: The Unholy Alliance between America's Biggest Bank and America's Biggest Crook.\n\nAll told, JPMorgan was fined more than $35 billion from 2011 to 2014, nearly all of it tied to the financial crisis and the company’s promotion and use of mortgage-backed securities, according to Dividend.com. In November 2013, the bank settled two major claims for selling bad mortgage securities between 2005 and 2008. In the first it paid $4.5 billion to settle claims by a group of institutional investors. Later that month, it agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department — the largest government such fine against a single U.S. firm — to resolve claims related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities by the bank itself as well as Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan to Pay Lehman $797.5 Million to End Litigation Over Collapse\n\nThe agreement included a statement of facts in which the bank admitted that the mortgage-backed securities it sold did not comply with underwriting guidelines and were not fit for sale. Nevertheless, Dimon did not admit to a violation of law and JPMorgan asserted that much of the improper conduct occurred at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.\n\nDespite those fines and the public relations battering it took from a slew of lawsuits, the bank’s profits have risen, as has its stock.\n\nJPM data by YCharts\n\nNow, with the Trump administration looking to undo banking regulations in the Dodd-Frank Act, Chaitman, the lawyer, says it will be up to the courts to eliminate incentives for the kind of behavior that led to the financial meltdown in the first place.\n\n“Hopefully,” she says, “honest hard-working Americans will find protection from judges who understand the importance of enforcing the law.”\n\nBraden Phillips is a freelance journalist who has covered business and other subjects for many newspapers over the last 25 years.\\"

    "text": "Donald Trump avoided the Conservative Political Action Conference in the heat of the Republican primary last year, amid rumors that some attendees would stage a walkout during his remarks. A year later, he appeared at the annual gathering as president, and was greeted not by protests but by a rapturous crowd of supporters prepared to cheer his every sentence.\n\nTo a large degree, the speech was an echo of remarks that White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon had made at the same event the day before, heavy on attacking the media, stoking nationalist sentiment and repeatedly asserting that the Trump administration is busy keeping the promises it made during the election.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nAfter greeting the crowd, Trump quickly launched into a lengthy attack on the press.\n\n“I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news,” he said. “It’s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They’re the enemy of the people.”\n\nTrump claimed that his comments about the press had been misreported, and that he had only singled out what he calls the “fake” news, not the entirety of the journalism world. But Trump’s original tweet had named a number of major news outlets. (He wrote, “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!”)\n\nOn Friday, despite saying that he was not against all media, he continued to paint with a very broad brush.\n\nRelated: Is Steve Bannon’s View of America’s Destiny a War Against Radical Islam?\n\n“Many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it’s not your agenda. And it’s not the country’s agenda,” he said. “It’s their own agenda. It doesn’t represent the people, it never will represent the people and we’re going to do something about it because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.”\n\nWhat the administration will “do” about the media remained unsaid. However, Trump did call for an end to anonymous sourcing in news stories. “I am only against the fake news media or press. Fake. Fake. I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use someone’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let there be no more ‘sources.’”\n\nAs Bannon had the day before, Trump also spoke out against globalism, saying “The core conviction of the movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first.”\n\nWhile it is important to have good relations with other countries, he said, “There is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America. I’m not representing the globe. I’m representing your country.”\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nHe was temporarily drowned out by chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” from the raucous crowd.\n\n“There is one allegiance that unites us all and that is to America,” he continued. “No matter our background income or geography we’re all citizens of this blessed land.”\n\nAll Americans, he added, bleed “the same red blood of great, great patriots.”\n\nTrump talked up his administration’s stepping the deportation of undocumented immigrants, saying at one point, “We’re getting bad people out of this country. People that shouldn’t be [here] whether it’s drugs or murder.”\n\nAt another, he generated cheers for the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement by saying, “We’re also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.”\n\nTrump also promised to oversee “one of the greatest military buildups in American history,” noting that he is about to submit “a massive budget request for our beloved military.”\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump’s New Immigration Orders\n\nHe said, “We will be substantially upgrading all of our military. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Nobody’s going to mess with us, folks.”\n\nHe again raised the specter of terrorism in Europe, citing a list of European cities that he suggested are now danger zones.\n\n“Take a look at what’s happening to our world folks,” he said. “We have to be smart. We can’t let it happen to us.”\n\nHe added, “In a matter of days we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and make America safe,” but did not explain further.\n\nReferring to many of his actions in his first month as president, Trump said, “Basically all I’ve done is keep my promise.”"

    "text": "In another indication of the growing opposition to the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for the first time a majority of Americans say they support the program, and most want to see it improved rather than dismantled.\n\nThese are the findings of a new Pew Research Center poll released this week showing that public support for the 2010 health care law that has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans is at its highest level on record.\n\nRelated: Boehner ‘Started Laughing’ When Republicans Vowed to Replace Obamacare\n\nFifty-four percent of the 1,503 adults surveyed Feb. 7 to 12 said they approve of former President Obama’s signature health insurance plan, while 43 percent say they disapprove. This marks a dramatic turning point because – until now – national polling by Pew, the Kaiser Family Foundation and others consistently found more people disapproving than approving of the program that provides subsidized coverage in the individual health care market.\n\nNot surprisingly, there continues to be a huge partisan divide over the controversial program. Republicans in the survey overwhelmingly opposed Obamacare (89 percent to 10 percent), while 85 percent of Democrats voiced approval. Slightly more than half of independents (53 percent) supported the plan.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans who disapprove of Obamacare are sorely divided over whether President Trump and congressional Republicans should get rid of the law entirely or modify the law to make improvements. Forty-two percent of those Republicans want to fix it, while 44 percent wan to get rid of it.\n\nThese latest findings must be food for thought for the Trump administration, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who are watching the air go out of the balloon for the “repeal and replace” movement that helped sweep them to victory last November.\n\nAngry voters from both parties have been turning out in droves at town hall meetings throughout the country to demand that lawmakers preserve Obamacare in some form for fear they will lose their insurance coverage next year."

    "text": "The appearance by White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday afternoon shed a bright light on the Trump administration’s opinions about the media, the inner workings of the White House and, most importantly, on what Bannon sees as the “center core” of the coalition of voters backing President Trump.\n\nThe United States, he stressed, “is a nation with an economy. Not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders….We are a nation with a culture and a reason for being,” he said, laying out his belief in “economic nationalism.”\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon Makes His Case for Economic Nationalism at CPAC\n\nBannon and Trump have both shown a willingness to set aside the prescriptions of mainstream economists about what is best for the economy in terms of things like international trade and the movement of jobs across borders. The goal, summed up in Trump’s “America First” motto is to promote the good of the United States, not the good of the economy.\n\nOf course, this raises the question: What, in the view of Bannon and Trump, is the good of the United States? Or, as Bannon put it on Thursday, what is the country’s true “reason for being?”\n\nIt’s not something that Bannon addressed directly from the stage at CPAC, but in other public and private forums, the former publisher of the Breitbart website has made it plain that he feels the defining issue of modern times is what he has characterized as a war between radical Islam and the “Judeo-Christian West.” The role and responsibility of leaders of the “West” he has said, is to defend its culture and civilization from the “barbarity” of Islam.\n\nIn 2014, Bannon appeared in a video conference before a small group called the Human Dignity Institute at the Vatican. In it, he stressed the need for a “Church Militant” to fight against what he described as “jihadist Islamic fascism.”\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\n“We’re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict,” he said, adding, that if the West fails to fight back it will “completely eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.”\n\nWhen Bannon talks about the economy and capitalism, he injects an element of personal and national destiny into the discussion.\n\n“So I think the discussion of, should we put a cap on wealth creation and distribution? It’s something that should be at the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist — ‘What is the purpose of whatever I’m doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I’m doing with the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth?’”\n\nHe continued, “I think it really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things. But also to make sure that we understand that we’re at the very beginning stages of a global conflict, and if we do not bind together as partners with others in other countries that this conflict is only going to metastasize.”\n\nRelated: The Conservative Conundrum: What to Do About the Alt-Right?\n\nTo the extent that Bannon believes the United States and indeed the civilized “West” is facing an existential threat that must be confronted forcefully and immediately, it feels reasonable to ask if he views the nation’s “reason for being” as the defeat of an enemy he thinks is out to destroy it.\n\nThe early moves the administration has made to block the flow of predominantly Muslim refugees from entering the country, the travel ban imposed on members of seven majority-Muslim countries, and the promise to ramp up military spending -- even in the face of large and persistent budget deficits, suggests that if it is not top of mind in the White House, it’s pretty close."

    "text": "White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon made a rare public appearance on Thursday, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, DC, where he described what he sees as a “new political order” forming in the US. Its unifying principle, he said, is the idea that the economy should be bent and shaped to serve the nation and its “reason for being.”\n\nBannon was making a joint appearance with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that was moderated by Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. During the conversation, Bannon described what he calls “economic nationalism” motivating President Donald Trump’s supporters.\n\nRelated: The Conservative Conundrum: What to Do About the Alt-Right?\n\nBannon’s said the new political order brings together populists, limited government conservatives, libertarians, and economic nationalists.\n\n“The center core of what we believe is that we’re a nation with an economy. Not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being,” he said. “I think that’s what unites us and I think that’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”\n\nMany of Trump’s early actions in office, such as strong-arming US companies into keeping jobs in domestic factories rather than outsourcing them, and considering punitive tariffs on those who don’t concede are of a piece with Bannon’s idea that the economy should serve the nation, not exist as a separate entity with its own interests.\n\nThe movement, he predicted, is going to be resisted daily by the mainstream media, which he referred to repeatedly as “the opposition party.”\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Spark a New GOP Split – or Maybe a Love Fest\n\n“It’s going to get worse every day,” he said. “Here’s why...They are corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed...to the economic, nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has.”\n\nHe continued, playing to the audience of conservative activists and college students. “Here’s why it’s going to get worse because he is going to continue to press his agenda. As economic conditions get better as more jobs get better, they are going to continue to fight. If you think they are going to give you your country back without a fight you are sadly mistaken.”\n\nBannon said that in the days ahead, the White House will press forward on three main “lines of work” including “national security and sovereignty,” “economic nationalism” and “deconstruction of the administrative state.”\n\nHe said that “one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history” was Trump’s decision to immediately withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement when he took office. The administration is now, he said, starting to think through a whole round of “amazing and innovative” bilateral trade relationships.\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nHe added, “The rule of law is going to exist when you talk about sovereignty and you talk about immigration.”\n\nHe also touched on why the Trump administration has chosen cabinet secretaries who, in some cases, seem diametrically opposed to the missions of their Departments.\n\n“If you look at these cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is deconstruction,” Bannon said. He accused the “progressive left” of using the regulatory state to implement rules and regulations that couldn’t pass Congress, and said, “That’s all going to be deconstructed.”\n\nBannon went on at some length with complaints about the media’s coverage of Trump.\n\n“President Trump while he was campaigning -- and this is another thing the mainstream media or opposition party never caught -- if you want to see the Trump agenda it’s all in the speeches. I happen to believe and many others do that he’s probably the greatest public speaker in those large public arenas since William Jennings Bryan.”\n\nNow in the White House, he said Trump is “maniacally” focused on implementing that agenda.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\n“That’s what the mainstream media won’t report,” he continued. “Just like they were dead wrong on the ‘chaos’ of the campaign, just like they were dead wrong on the ‘chaos’ in the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong on what’s going on today.”\n\nThe Trump team is “grinding” forward he said, adding, “the mainstream media better understand something all of those promises are going to be implemented.”\n\n“That’s awesome,” said Schlapp.\n\nThe appearance was not without its awkward moments. At the very beginning of the conversation, Bannon reminded Schlapp that his ideas have not always been welcome on the CPAC stage. In years past, Breitbart-sponsored panels called “The Uninvited” during CPAC to showcase voices not heard from the main stage.\n\nBannon’s appearance also followed by a few hours the executive director of the American Conservative Union, Dan Schneider, who denounced the “alt-right” movement.\n\n“They are anti-Semites, they are racists, they are sexists,” he said. “They hate the constitution, they hate free markets, they hate pluralism. They hate and despise everything we believe in. They are not an extension of conservatism.”\n\nAs publisher of Breitbart, Bannon once described his website as “a platform for the alt-right.”"

    "text": "Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has been watching the controversy over health care play out from the sidelines, and he understands better than most how hard it is to forge a compromise within his party, even under the best of circumstances.\n\nBoehner is no fan of President Donald Trump, and declared last December that the election campaign had been “the most bizarre political year that we've seen in 100 years.” In the new Trumpian political era, Boehner is persona non grata among many Republicans he once led.\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on Trump and Congress as Replacing Obamacare Flounders\n\nWhile the former speaker’s comments will be taken with a grain of salt by diehards determined to repeal and replace the Obamacare later this year, Boehner on Thursday predicted that Trump and the Republicans would fall far short of their goal. Instead, they will have to settle for improvements in the Affordable Care Act around the edges.\n\nDuring a healthcare conference in Orlando, Florida today, the savvy, chain-smoking veteran lawmaker with the year-round tan declared that repeal and replacement of Obamacare are “not going to happen.” as Politico reported.\n\nWhile Boehner for years led his party in staunch opposition to the Affordable Care Act and initiated legal action to block key provisions of the law, he said today that “Most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act” will survive, adding that “Republicans never ever agree on healthcare.”\n\nBoehner hastened his retirement in 2015 after frequent bitter clashes with Tea Party conservatives in his caucus over compromises he was forced to strike with President Obama over budget, debt ceiling and tax issues and funding for Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nHis successor, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), has championed efforts to dismantle Obamacare this spring as part of an expedited budget resolution. Ryan last week unveiled a rough draft of his proposals that he insists would provide cheaper and better insurance coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nRyan and Trump both vowed to ram their replacement plan through Congress early this year – although it’s not clear now whether the Trump administration will prepare a plan of its own or simply offer advice to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on what should be in it.\n\nBoehner today dismissed Ryan’s and Trump’s earlier upbeat predictions that their replacement plan would sail through Congress as just “happy talk.”\n\n“I started laughing,” he said. “Republicans never ever agree on health care.”"

    "text": "Barely a month into the new Trump era, Americans are beginning to sour on President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress as the wheels begin to come off the GOP drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVoter displeasure with some GOP policies, particularly the effort to dismantle Obamacare instead of finding ways to improve it, have been welling up during town hall meetings held by Republican House and Senate members during a week-long congressional recess. And there are indications that the White House may renege on Trump’s repeated pledge to unveil a comprehensive new health insurance plan sometime in the next few weeks.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nNew surveys suggest that Trump’s approval rating, historically low at the start of his first term in office, continues to plummet while voters fear the country is on the wrong track. They are questioning whether congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) can make good on their party’s top promises, including replacing Obamacare with a new conservative approach, overhauling the federal tax code, and bringing more jobs back from overseas.\n\nAlthough most surveys show Trump in the low to mid 40s, a Quinnipiac University survey released on Wednesday found that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance compared with only 38 percent who approve of it. This 17-point gap in public approval of Trump is the widest since he took office in mid-January. Several other new polls find a smaller disparity, ranging from five points to 10 points.\n\n“President Trump’s popularity is sinking like a rock,\" Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the poll, said in a statement releasing the findings. “He gets slammed on honesty, empathy, level headedness and the ability to unite. And two of his strong points, leadership and intelligence, are sinking to new lows. This is a terrible survey one month in.”\n\nA new YouGov/ Economist poll found that 56 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Congress is doing, compared to 19 percent who approve of what’s going on in Washington, while 53 percent say the country is going in the wrong direction.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nAt the same time, voter sentiment about the long-troubled Obamacare program continues to improve – with many more interested in seeing Congress fix the problems that are driving up premiums and driving insurers out of the market instead of dismantling a program that has insured more than 20 million Americans.\n\nA new Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 51 percent of voters still support repealing Obamacare – with far more Republicans than Democrats taking that stand. But that is down from 58 percent at the beginning of the year, before it became painfully obvious that Trump and the congressional Republicans have been unable to agree on a replacement plan that could pass muster with a majority of lawmakers and key health care interests and consumers.\n\nA total of 32 percent of American voters are “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that they will lose their current health insurance if the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, is repealed, according to another Quinnipiac University survey. A total of 68 percent are “not so concerned” or “not concerned at all.”\n\nArmed by their leaders with only vague talking points of what a GOP replacement plan might look like, GOP lawmakers are being hammered by constituents from both parties at recent town hall meetings across the country. The latest victim was Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a rising star in his party, who was grilled for nearly two hours last night by many of the 2,000 angry constituents who packed an auditorium in Springdale, Ark.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nSome told Cotton that they were alive today thanks to their Obamacare coverage and demanded to know what he and the Republicans intended to go to continue providing coverage to millions of Americans, especially those with serious pre-existing health problems. One woman said her husband is dying and challenged Cotton to sit down with her and her family to learn about their experiences, according to the Huffington Post.\n\n“You want to stand there . . . and expect us to be calm, cool and collected,” she said. “Well, what kind of insurance do you have?”\n\nTrump and other GOP leaders have been pooh-poohing the large turnout of protesters at recent town hall events, suggesting that they were mostly paid agitators put up by the Democrats and liberal political action groups. But it’s likely that the protests that have been garnering widespread media attention have Republican leaders rattled.\n\nTrump has long promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would provide better and less expensive health insurance and repeatedly promised last month to unveil a “fabulous” plan shortly after his new health and human services secretary, Tom Price, was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSource: RealClearPolitics\n\nJust on Wednesday, Trump boasted during a meeting with his economic and budget advisers that planning for a replacement health care plan “is moving along nicely,” and that within the next few weeks he would submit something “that people will be very impressed by.”\n\nBut whether Trump has been simply lying until now or is beginning to get cold feet amid signs the “repeal and replace” movement is imploding, the administration just sent a message that Trump may be pulling back and leaving the heavy political lift to Ryan, McConnell and other Republican congressional leaders.\n\nAccording to a report by John Harwood of CNBC, Price, a former Georgia congressman, has told House Republicans that the administration wouldn’t be sending lawmakers a specific bill. Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a veteran lawmaker closely allied with the leadership, told CNBC that Price and the administration “will cooperate and provide input into what we do” but that it “wouldn’t be sending us a bill.”\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nIn fairness, former President Barack Obama encouraged Democratic leaders, including then-Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus, to take the lead in drafting the Affordable Care Act legislation in 2009. But Trump has led everyone to expect that his new administration would provide a solid framework for the scores of ideas that have been circulated by House and Senate lawmakers for months.\n\nWithout Trump getting behind a plan and vigorously pushing for its passage, the GOP drive to complete action on a budget reconciliation package to repeal and replace Obamacare this spring could collapse of its own weight."

    "text": "Stung by the embarrassment of having to disinvite right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos from a speaking slot at its Conservative Political Action Conference this year, the American Conservative Union sent out one of its top officials on Thursday to denounce a fringe political movement Yiannopoulos is associated with.\n\nYiannopoulos was bounced after a video surfaced showing him speaking approvingly about sexual relationships between adult men and young teenage boys. He has long been associated with the so-called alt-right movement, which is associated with white nationalism and antisemitism, among other things. He also worked as an editor for the Breitbart website whose former publisher and now White House strategist Steve Bannon described as a forum for the alt-right.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could Spark a New GOP Split – or Maybe a Love Fest\n\n“There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks,” Dan Schneider, the ACU’s executive director, warned the gathering of right wing activists and college students. We must not be duped, we must not be deceived. This is serious business. We have heard what conservatism is. We have to make sure we understand what conservatism is not.”\n\nThat’s when things started to get a little weird, because Schneider made repeated efforts to assure the crowd that the alt-right is actually some sort of left-wing front group trying to infiltrate the ranks of real conservatives.\n\n“Just a few years ago, this hate-filled left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term ‘alt-right,’” he said, calling it a term that has been used “for a long time” and “in a very normal way.”\n\n“This group has hijacked the term and they did it intentionally because they want to deceive the media and they want to deceive you all about what they stand for so that they can try to become normalized and we must not allow them to become normalized. They are not a part of us. They stole that term specifically to confuse us.”\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nSchneider was plainly referring to a loose-knit movement led by Richard Spencer, a self-described white “identitarian” who hosted a controversial conference in Washington not long after Donald Trump won the presidential election. At one point during the gathering. Spencer raised his arm in a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute and led the cheer “Hail Trump!” (For his part, Spencer says he was holding a whiskey glass and was making a toast.)\n\n“We know who these people are,” Schneider said. “They met just a couple of months ago in Washington, D.C., to spew their hatred and make their ‘Heil Hitler’ salutes. They are anti-Semites, they are racists, they are sexists. They hate the Constitution, they hate free markets, they hate pluralism. They hate and despise everything we believe in. They are not an extension of conservatism.”\n\nAgain, he tried to tie the alt-right to the political left, insisting, “They are nothing but garden-variety left-wing fascists.”\n\nSpencer, in fact, was in the audience for Schneider’s brief remarks, and live-tweeted during the remarks.\n\n“Dan Schneider--who is this guy? Really lame,” he wrote.\n\nSpencer was soon escorted out of the conference by security. Outside the auditorium, Spencer spoke to reporters, mocking Schneider’s remarks as “name-calling” and pushing back against the idea that his movement is not part of the political right.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump’s New Immigration Orders\n\nHe said that he supported CPAC’s decision to disinvite Yiannopoulos, calling his behavior unacceptable and claiming that the former Breitbart editor “was never alt-right.”\n\nWhen reporters resisted, claiming that Yiannopoulos had tied himself closely to the movement, Spencer said, “I coined the term ‘alt-right.’ I hereby declare he is not alt-right.”\n\nHe went on to insist that people who call him a racist, an anti-Semite or a fascist are just trying to shut down what he claims is a legitimate discussion of issues like “Israeli influence on American policy” and “Jewish identity.”\n\nAsked why he is frequently referred to as a fascist, he said, “People want to shut down what I am saying. People don’t want to think about identity for European Americans seriously. They want to shut us down so they use a host of catchphrases and words like that. That’s clearly the reason.”\n\n“Race matters,” he said. “Race is the foundation of identity. So if anyone says that, they say ‘Oh, you’re a racist.’ That’s just a way of shutting us up. And it doesn’t work anymore.”\n\nSpencer also noted that in President Trump he sees, if not a fellow member of the alt-right, at least an ally.\n\n“It’s not so much that he’s alt-right as that he’s a nationalist and a populist,” he said. “He’s connected to us on a basic level. He doesn’t articulate our ideas, he’s not an identitarian, but his arrow points in our direction.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/23/Federal-Block-Grants-Have-Been-Big-Financial-Loser-States",
    "text": "A key element of the Republicans’ plan for replacing Obamacare is transforming the costly Medicaid program into a series of block grants to the states. The idea is to save the federal government billions of dollars in the coming years while giving state officials more flexibility to set eligibility requirements and spending levels to provide health care services to the nation’s poor and disabled.\n\nBut there is one serious catch: While the extensive use of block grants has proven over the years to be a great financial boon for Congress and the federal government in attempting to rein in spending, it has been a bad deal for the states and hundreds of millions of Americans dependent on federal assistance.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nFederal funding for 13 major block grant programs for housing, health, and social services has dropped by 27 percent or $14 billion since 2000 or by 37 percent when adjusting for inflation and population growth, according to a new analysis by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nDavid Reich, a senior fellow on federal fiscal policy and a co-author of the study, said in an interview Wednesday the simple fact is that “funding for block grants tends to decline over time.”\n\n“If you convert programs to block grants and combine programs into block grants, very likely – based on history – the funding is going to go down – it’s not going to keep pace with need,” he added.\n\nIn the distant past, Congress poured tens of billions of dollars into state coffers through categorical grants and formulas that were targeted for specific activities and purposes. But that began to change in the 1980s during the Reagan administration when those funds were bundled into broader spending categories under the rubric of block grants.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Bad Guys\n\nThe original purpose was manifold – to grant the states more authority and flexibility to tailor services to constituents’ needs while looking for ways to make savings to stay within the block grant amounts. Over time, however, Congress and the executive branch viewed the block grant system primarily as a money saver.\n\nToday, block grants range from home investment partnerships and job training to substance abuse prevention and community development action.\n\nThe largest block grant in the study -- the 1997 welfare reform program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) – currently receives $16.57 billion annually and has lost a third of its value due to inflation. It was designed to encourage more people to work rather than to rely on welfare. At the same time, the amount of basic assistance TANF provides has fallen even more as states shift those resources to other programs.\n\nLow income and impoverished Americans are not left in the lurch, however, since they have access to a variety of other federal safety net programs including food stamps (SNAP), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Housing Assistance, Child Nutrition Program (CHIP), Feeding Programs (WIC & CSFP), Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and Lifeline (a free cellphone service).\n\nThe Community Development Block Grant totals $2.99 billion annually, down 51 percent from 2000. The $1.85 billion that goes for substance abuse prevention and treatment totals $1.85 billion, down 19 percent from 2000.\n\nThe loss of funding for these and other programs is even more pronounced when measured against the relative size of the economy, which has grown substantially since 2000. In 2000, total block-grant funding equaled 0.36 percent of the economy, according to the report. By 2017, this share of GDP had dropped to 0.20 percent, a decline of more than two-fifths. It’s not clear if the community development programs failed to meet performance benchmarks or if the substance abuse and prevention treatment dollars were replaced by grants to existing medical facilities or rehab centers.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAmong the 13 programs in the study, only the Child Care and Development Fund and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant have grown since their inception, in 1997 and 1993, respectively.\n\n“An unfortunate irony here is that while policymakers assert state flexibility as a prime reason to block-grant programs, this flexibility can later be used to justify cutting them or eliminating them entirely,” the report states.\n\nA good example was when Congress created the Social Security Block Grant in 1982 to give the states more administrative and policy flexibility over the services provided. Over time, conservative lawmakers complained that the program was giving the states too much flexibility and that it had turned into a “no-strings-attached” slush fund.\n\nNow conservatives are considering giving states block grants for Medicaid.\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 81 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. Republicans have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste. Medicaid spending grew 9.7 percent to $545.1 billion in 2015, or 17 percent of total national expenditures on health, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That increase was twice the rate of growth in spending for Medicare for the elderly.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nWhat's more, government spending on Medicaid expansion under Obamacare turned out to be much higher than original projections, according to an analysis by Forbes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated in its 2014 Medicaid Actuarial Report that newly eligible enrollees would cost $4,281, on average, in 2015. Yet in a 2015 report issued in July 2016, CMS raised the per capita cost to $6,366—a 49 percent increase.\n\nA dramatic upward revision of enrollment and spending for each enrollee significantly altered the bottom line cost for expanded Medicaid, Forbes noted. In April 2014, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal share of Medicaid expansion spending would be $42 billion in 2015. The actual federal cost turned out to be roughly $68 billion — or 62 percent higher than predicted.\n\nGOP efforts to convert Medicaid from a federal entitlement covering all eligible people to block grants to the states dates back to the Reagan administration.\n\nAs now portrayed by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), a block grant would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade. At present, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states’ Medicaid costs — on average 57 percent — and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nLast November, CBPP issued an analysis showing that a block grant proposal included in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion — or nearly 25 percent — over ten years, relative to current law. Another analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal promoted by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage."

The islands are more than 500 miles from the Chinese mainland.\n\nRelated: The Emerging Arms Race at Sea for the US, China and Russia\n\nBeijing may be feeling emboldened by the initial disarray of a new administration in Washington and President Trump’s early flirtation with Taiwan before backing down and endorsing the “one China” policy in the face of stern Chinese warnings.\n\nBut the U.S. military sent a signal last weekend that China shouldn’t take diplomatic missteps as a sign of weakness. A carrier strike group steamed into the South China Sea on Saturday, led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. The Vinson and its accompanying ships are conducting “routine operations,” according to the website of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.\n\nAbout $5 trillion in trade passes through the South China Sea, according to the South China Morning Post, and Southeast Asia countries dependent on the U.S. and China worry that area – parts of which are claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei – will become a flashpoint in the tense relations between Beijing and Washington.\n\nRelated: China Is Ready to Step into America’s Role as World Leader\n\nThe 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is unanimous in its concern over “militarization of the region,” the Philippine Foreign Secretary told reporters, according to the Post.

    "text": "Republicans, populists, and conservatives have not had it this good in at least a decade, and perhaps not ever – collectively, at least. Populists lifted Donald Trump to the presidency, while Republicans and conservatives continued an eight-year crescendo in majorities in the House, Senate, state legislatures, and gubernatorial seats. The Grand Old Party has its best opportunity since perhaps Reconstruction to remake government from the federal level all the way down to the counties and cities, while at the same time clear the regulatory decks for economic expansion.\n\nAnd yet, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described their situation as … dire. In an appearance on ABC’s The View, Schumer told the host panel that Republicans in Congress have begun itching to abandon Trump after just thirty days in office. \"A lot of the Republicans, they're mainstream people,” Schumer explained. “They will feel they have no choice but to break with him,” over what Schumer declared as Trump’s radical agenda. \"My prediction is [if] he keeps up on this path,” Schumer concluded, “within three, four months you're going to see a whole lot of Republicans breaking with him.”\n\nRelated: This Year’s CPAC Conference – Light on Leaders, Long on Trump Appointees\n\nPerhaps the perspective of the top Senate Democrat might be a bit skewed. At least thus far, Congress has moved in lockstep with the new administration, while it appears that Schumer’s colleagues on Capitol Hill have deviated far from the mainstream path. At least four House Democrats have openly encouraged impeachment efforts against the new president, so much so that other House Democrats have begun asking them to please stop talking about it.\n\nTwo other House Democrats – Jackie Speier and Earl Blumenauer – have suggested using the 25th Amendment to remove the president. Speier explained in a CNN interview that Trump’s alleged “incapacity” consisted of using the same communication style that won Trump the election. “He has got to get a grip,” Speier told Brianna Keilar, “he has to start acting presidential. … You don’t take on people saying nasty things about them.” That might come as a surprise to the voters who saw him do just that to Republicans and Democrats alike over the course of the election cycle and gave him a 306-232 Electoral College win for it.\n\nIn comparison, Republicans on Capitol Hill seem much less flustered with their new status in single-party governance. The House and Senate have begun repealing Barack Obama’s final-hours regulations through the rarely used Congressional Review Act. That allows Congress to not only overturn regulations but also forbids later administrations from re-enacting them without Congressional approval. With Trump in the White House engineering a parallel advance of deregulatory policy in the executive branch, it looks much more like a honeymoon than a pending divorce.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nSchumer’s counterparts in Republican leadership hardly sound alarmed at Trump’s first month in office either. Both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have expressed their misgivings over Trump’s communication style, but both have also concurred with Trump’s policy directions. Ryan went to the Mexican border this week to build support for funding Trump’s wall, while McConnell told Salena Zito that Trump has done exactly what any other Republican president would do.\n\n\"Everything that has happened, since he has taken office, has been reassuring to me,” McConnell says of Trump’s performance. “He has picked an absolutely stunning individual for the Supreme Court, [and] we have already put in place the mechanism to repeal and replace Obamacare.”\n\nOf course, the marriage between populists, conservatives, and party-line Republicans will get tested in the future. Will the different factions focus on common goals and stay united through Trump’s first term, offering flexibility on areas of potential disagreement? One key test will take place this week in National Harbor, Maryland. The annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) begins Thursday and will feature appearances from both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Even that pairing signals a change of sorts and a potential sign of post-election focus. A year ago, Trump backed out of a commitment to speak rather than conform to the moderator format used for all other candidates, while Pence has long been a favorite of the conservative activist groups that attend CPAC.\n\nRelated: How Illegal Immigrant Advocates Demonize Trump and Terrify People\n\nThe CPAC event carries significant weight within think-tank and grassroots circles. Does it mean anything for the millions of voters who don’t attend political conferences? Perhaps this year more than most, yes. Before 2016, Republicans and conservatives didn’t put a lot of trust in one another, and neither trusted populists at all. That played out at previous CPACs and other conferences, but without the power to govern, the clashes were largely academic.\n\nSingle-party governance has raised the stakes significantly in 2017. With only some limited exceptions for Democratic obstructionism – both on presidential appointments and on potential filibusters on legislation – the three-way alliance must show it can deliver on promises made in the election cycle. Trump has to make government work; Republicans have to shrink government while ensuring that the Rust Belt voters don’t wind up paying the price for it.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nAll of the competing interests will meld together at CPAC – on the main stage, in the breakout sessions, and in the halls and concourses. Lawmakers will speak and engage on these topics to get a sense of whether they have support for specific policies and general agendas. This won’t be the venue for conclusions, but the interaction at CPAC will portend whether the alliance can hold together while differing on the priorities and the particulars.\n\nThe biggest potential fracture points for the GOP’s success in single-party governance are not between the White House and Capitol Hill, as Schumer believes. They lie between these three factions. By the end of CPAC, we may see just how dangerous those fault lines could be."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/22/Why-Budget-Hawks-Want-Keep-Obama-s-Cadillac-Tax",
    "text": "In brief remarks on Wednesday, President Trump reiterated his promise that the administration, in concert with Congressional Republicans, will release a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act within the next few weeks. If there is indeed a proposal on the way, Trump and Congress will have to find a way to pay for revamping a healthcare system that is now largely funded through taxes that are a core element of the ACA.\n\nThese include the ACA’s employer mandate, the Medicare surtax, and a number of other tax-related provisions in the law that would provide some $900 billion in revenue over the next decade. Presumably, repeal would also eliminate the controversial “Cadillac” tax on high-cost health insurance policies provided by insurers.\n\nRelated: Five Questions Republicans Can’t Answer About Their Obamacare Replacement\n\nThe Cadillac Tax, which is set to go into effect in 2020, imposes a 40 percent income tax on individual insurance with a value of more than $11,000 per year ($29,000 for a family). In essence, it removes the tax exemption for generous employer-provider health insurance. It’s projected to raise $100 billion by 2027.\n\nBut the tax doesn’t affect the one percent nearly as much as it hits unions, which traded salary increases over the years for more generous health plans. As a result, the push back from the Alliance to Fight the 40, is gaining strength from businesses, unions and some in the medical community.\n\nBut, as the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget notes in a recent blog post, whatever plan Republicans develop to replace the ACA will have to be paid for as well, and eliminating all of the current laws tax revenue just means the money will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nOne option for keeping some funding in place, CRFB argues, is keeping the Cadillac Tax in place. Another, perhaps better one, is peeling back the income tax exclusion for Employer-Provided Insurance either partially or entirely.\n\nAs a revenue source, keeping the Cadillac Tax in place would generate a lot of revenue, ramping up to more than $100 billion a year by the mid-2030s. It would also push back against rising healthcare spending.\n\nRelated: Congress Pushes Back as Trump Spurs Anti-Vaccine Movement\n\nBut at CRFB, the preferred move is different: striking at the tax exclusion directly.\n\n“A more direct limit to the ESI tax exclusion would also slow health care cost growth, increase wages, and reduce future deficits. In fact, recent analysis suggests a direct limit to the ESI exclusion could achieve these goals in a more progressive and efficient way and would have the further benefit of better equalizing the tax treatment of wage- and non-wage income,” they write.\n\n“For example, by our very rough estimates, fully eliminating the income tax exclusion beginning in 2020 would save $1.3 trillion through 2027, more than enough to replace all the revenue loss from repealing the ACA's taxes and its mandates. Policymakers could also replace the income tax exclusion with a fixed tax credit or deduction, which would retain the incentive to provide insurance but end the incentive to hold the most costly insurance and generate $100 to $200 billion of revenue, depending on how fast they indexed the new tax benefit.”\n\nHowever, all taxes are politically unpopular, and existing tax benefits are very hard to eliminate in Congress. Combine that with the general reluctance among republicans in Congress to get their hands anywhere near a tax increase, and it makes it the CRFB plan an extreme long shot."

    "text": "Alarmed by the growing anti-vaccination movement that has been fanned by President Trump, Republican and Democratic leaders of the premier congressional health committees have mounted a campaign to persuade parents to get their young kids vaccinated against measles, whooping cough and other serious diseases.\n\nFor many, it seems like the height of irrationality and recklessness to risk the health of America’s young people by denying them vaccines that have all but eradicated most serious childhood diseases, including polio. Yet a growing number of parents in this country have seized on long-discredited research to argue that vaccinations can lead to autism in their children.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance New Health Plan\n\nTrump has embraced this unfounded notion to the point of considering launching a national commission to investigate possible links between vaccines and autism – one headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.\n\nWith the anti-vaccine movement picking up steam, most notably in Texas, perplexed GOP and Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday signed a letter to their colleagues in the House and Senate seeking to enlist them in trying to restore sanity to this public health care debate and bring the discussion back into the realm of scientific research, according to Axios.\n\n\"We write to you today to highlight the importance of immunizations, which protect Americans, especially infants and children, against outbreaks of serious and deadly infectious diseases,” the letter stated. “Vaccines save lives.”\n\nThey added that as members of Congress, “we have a critical role to play in supporting the availability and use of vaccines to protect Americans from deadly diseases.”\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nThe lawmakers signing the letter included Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA), the chair and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP), and Reps. Greg Walden (R-OR) and Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), the chair and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nPublic health officials have warned that the growing movement away from childhood vaccinations is undermining the extraordinary progress made over the years in combatting deadly or crippling childhood diseases. Worldwide, vaccines prevent the death of an estimated 2.5 million children every year, although deadly diseases like measles continue to pose a problem in areas where not enough children are vaccinated, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nIn Texas, where parents legally can exercise a “personal-belief exemption” to prevent their children from being vaccinated, the number of school-aged children who are not being vaccinated has climbed dramatically since 2003. The number of cases of parents exercising a personal belief exemption soared from 2,314 during the 2003-2004 school year to 44,716 during the past school year, according to the Post.\n\nResearch published nearly 20 years ago sought to show a link between childhood vaccines and autism, but that data was subsequently discredited due to falsified information. Since 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found no link between vaccines and autism.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nNonetheless, Trump, who has no scientific background or training, has repeatedly raised the possibility of a link between the two. Most recently, during a Feb. 14 meeting with special education principals and teachers, Trump said: “What’s going on with autism? When you look at the tremendous increases, it’s really — it’s such an incredible – is it really a horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase.”"

    "text": "At a time when President Donald Trump is signaling an American withdrawal from a leadership role in global affairs, Chinese President XI Jinping is increasingly willing to pick up the slack. The Chinese state media, in recent days, has been stressing what it characterizes as a major shift in Beijing’s posture toward the rest of the world.\n\nLast month, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Xi mounted a strong defense of global trade at the same time that the Trump administration was promising to withdraw from a major trade deal among Pacific nations that notably excluded China.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nThe Davos speech was one of a number of times when Xi has asserted the desire for China to play a part in shaping the order of world where economic and other ties between nations are less regional and more global. But in recent remarks delivered at a national security seminar in Beijing, he went further, telling attendees that China needs to step in to “guide” the development of a new world order, taking the place of the US.\n\n“The United States may no longer want to be a provider of global security and public goods, instead, pursuing unilateralism and even nationalist foreign policy,” he said, according to a state-run news website.\n\nThe Xinhua state news organization quoted Xi saying, “The overall direction of multi-polarization of the world, the globalization of the economy and the democratization of international relations has not changed...No matter how the international situation changes, we must maintain our strategic steadiness, strategic confidence, and strategic patience.”\n\nFurther paraphrasing the president’s remarks, Xinhua wrote, “He called for global vision in national security work, coordinating development and security, combining principles with tactics, and taking the strategic initiative in China's own hand.”\n\nRelated: In the Age of Trump, Who Can US Allies Believe?\n\nThe new posture of the Chinese government, which state media refers to as a “Two Guides” policy stressing international security as well as a restructuring of the world order, appears to be something that Beijing wants to broadcast widely, as it has appeared in various state-controlled forums.\n\nThe speech came a week after Xi spoke with President Trump on the telephone. In the conversation, Trump seemed to reverse course on a break with the standard US “one China” policy -- Washington does not formally recognize the government of Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway republic.\n\nTrump had appeared to signal a change in stance by taking a phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in December while he was still president-elect. According to a White House readout of Trump’s call with Xi, “The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘one China’ policy.”\n\nRelated: The Army Is Developing Its Most Lethal Gun Yet\n\nAt the same time that Xi is calling for a greater Chinese role in global security matters, Beijing is ramping up its militarization of the South China Sea with the construction of what appear to be long-range missile launch facilities on artificial islands it has created.\n\nThe move will undoubtedly be seen as yet another test by global adversaries of the new president. The US this week sent an aircraft carrier strike group to begin patrols in the South China Sea."

    "text": "It’s been a heady couple of years for the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, which kicks off this afternoon outside of Washington, D.C. The extended campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and its vast field of candidates has for two years guaranteed that the agenda at the annual gathering was packed with GOP luminaries, many of whom had their sights set on the Oval Office.\n\nThis year, though, the most attention any of the invited speakers are receiving is the coverage being lavished on Milo Yiannopoulos, the disgraced former technology editor of the Breitbart website who doubled as a race and gender-baiting provocateur for the alt-right. After a year-old video of Yiannopoulos appearing to advocate sexual relationships between young teenage boys and older men, CPAC’s leadership hastily withdrew his invitation, followed by Simon & Schuster canceling a book deal.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nThe exclusion of Yiannopoulos will make what was already a pretty thin lineup of speakers even more so. CPAC 2017 will have its share of headliners, mainly from the Trump administration. President Trump himself will make an appearance on Friday afternoon, and Vice President Pence will appear at a 7:30 p.m. session Thursday night.\n\nSeveral of the president’s top advisers will make an appearance, including White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. The latter two will be on stage simultaneously, apparently in an effort to knock down persistent rumors that they are not getting along in a White House that has multiple competing power centers.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos will also sit for a live interview with a friendly host.\n\nBut while the top ranks of the White House will be represented, the same cannot be said for the Congress. According to an agenda released Tuesday night, no members of leadership from either the House or Senate will appear at the event.\n\nIn fact, the only sitting senator scheduled to show up is ultra-conservative Ted Cruz, of Texas.\n\nRelated: In the Age of Trump, Who Can US Allies Believe?\n\nPickings are slim on the House side as well. Rep. Kevin Brady, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will be the most influential House member in attendance. A half-dozen lesser lights from the chamber will also appear, mostly as panelists in guided discussions.\n\nWhile the lineup of speakers may lack the punch of years past, it will be interesting to see what the conference’s general attitude toward Trump is now that he is both the president and the de facto leader of the Republican Party.\n\nBy the time CPAC began in 2016, Trump was already leading the Republican primary and people were beginning to take seriously the possibility that he might win. Not all of them were happy about it.\n\nLast year, conservative darling Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, an early and consistent Trump critic, delivered a speech that served as a barely concealed plea not to vote for the billionaire former reality television star. It also coincided with a controversial speech delivered by former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, in which he called then-candidate Trump “a phony and a fraud.”\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nAt the time, many CPAC attendees were seemingly conflicted about Trump but were livid at the possibility that establishment Republicans like Romney might drive him away with his many followers in tow.\n\nRon Nervitt, a retired federal employee from Williamsburg, VA said, “I’m not a Trump supporter but I think what the Republicans are doing in trying to scuttle him is terrible.”\n\n“If Trump wins, it’s ‘Oh, my God,’’ he said. “But if Trump gets scuttled? ‘Oh, my God. Oh, my God.’ Because I don’t see any of the Trump supporters voting this year if they really do something like that.”\n\nKarl Nilson of Bowie, Maryland, who was walking around last year’s CPAC conference in a shirt with a “Stop Trump” sign on it, said, “In the end, if he gets the most votes, gets the most delegates, he should get the nomination. I’m not going to vote for him. But I think it would be a disaster if he does win the nomination and is denied it somehow.”\n\nAs the conference was going on, and amid rumors of a planned walkout during his speech, Trump canceled his scheduled appearance there at the last minute, citing campaign commitments in the Midwest.\n\n“Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years,” the campaign said in a statement that now looks oddly prescient. “Mr. Trump would like to thank Matt Schlapp and all of the executives at CPAC and looks forward to returning to next year, hopefully as president of the United States.”"

    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) did something extremely cruel to their rank-and-file Republican members last week: They sent them home for a week-long recess defenseless in addressing constituents’ growing fears about losing their Obamacare and Medicaid coverage.\n\nRyan, the GOP leadership’s top policy guru, and McConnell, the wily strategist, sought to rally their members late last week on the need to “save” Americans from the collapse of the Affordable Care Act – including rising premiums and declining policy choices as Humana and other major insurers announce their intentions to drop out of the market in the coming year because of huge financial losses.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nRyan told his members that he and other GOP leaders were closing in on a plan to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a series of dramatic changes, including a refundable tax credit to help consumers cover premium costs, increased availability of tax-exempt health savings accounts, and a revamping of the Medicaid program for low-income Americans.\n\nThe House GOP approach – loosely spelled out in a thin booklet of talking points -- would preserve a number of features of the existing Obamacare law, including preventing insurers from discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical problems and allowing children to remain on their parents’ private health care plans until they turn 26. And the Republicans would experiment with federally financed, state-run “high-risk pools” to provide coverage to older and sicker Americans who can’t find affordable health insurance in the private market.\n\nBut the disparate talking points lack a coherent framework. And critics say they raise more questions than they answer. Without the benefit of a hard-boiled analysis and scoring by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation – that probably won’t be available until members return from recess -- there is virtually no way to know what the unfolding GOP Obamacare replacement plan adds up to.\n\nWhat’s more, the House GOP plan is just one of a handful of plans making the rounds on Capitol Hill. And President Trump has promised to unveil the details of a plan of his own next month.\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nThat may help to explain why many GOP lawmakers have been set back on their heels by probing questions now being posed by Republican and Democratic constituents alike about the future of the health care system if Trump and GOP leaders make good on their campaign pledge to “repeal and replace” Obamacare.\n\nMoveOn.org and other liberal groups are mobilizing members to attend town-hall meetings across the country, The New York Times reported, and MoveOn has created a website, ResistanceRecess.com, to help people find the meetings. The site also includes a guide to “health care messaging.” Not all of these attendees benefit from Obamacare if any. Their goal is to disrupt the meetings and leave the impression that most of their constituents want the government to continue funding Obamacare.\n\nIn recent days, Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Tom McClintock of California have been swamped by irate constituents voicing fear and outrage over the possibility they may lose their health insurance, while other Republicans have ducked scheduled town hall meetings, fearing violent confrontations. Just yesterday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa was swamped with questions as well at two town hall meetings in Iowa.\n\nDuring one of those meetings at the Iowa Falls community center, Chris Petersen, 62, a pig farmer and self-described progressive Democrat who suffers from diabetes, told Grassley he frets about losing his health insurance, according to Politico.\n\nRelated: The New Obamacare Rules Help Insurers But Not Consumers\n\n“If it wasn’t for Obamacare, we wouldn’t be able to afford insurance,” Petersen said. “Over 20 million will lose coverage, and with all due respect, sir, you’re the man who talked about the death panels [in opposing enactment of Obamacare in 2009]. You’re going to create one great big death panel in this country for people who can’t afford to get insurance.”\n\nGrassley sought to reassure the crowd by saying that there were three or four main GOP health care plans being circulated in Congress that would preserve the most popular features of Obamacare. He ventured to speculate that under any of those alternative GOP plans, the 20 million people currently covered by Obamacare won’t lose their coverage.\n\nBut without the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation scoring any of those plans, it’s virtually impossible to assess their impact. What’s more, there’s no way of knowing for sure how much of their replacement plan Republicans will be able to enact under the expedited budget reconciliation budget rules they intend to employ this spring or summer to repeal the heart of Obamacare’s mandates and regulations.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare’s Individual Mandate Optional\n\n“The House Republican talking points begin by indicting the ACA’s health insurance marketplaces and Medicaid in an attempt to justify rushing to repeal the former and radically overhaul the latter,” the liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report last week. “But in fact, these programs are providing affordable, quality health insurance for tens of millions of Americans, and the ACA has improved coverage for tens of millions more. Dismantling the ACA and restructuring and cutting Medicaid will only worsen health care access, quality, and affordability, the standards by which any health care legislation should be judged.”\n\nHere are five questions the Republicans can’t currently answer:\n\nWill the more than 8 million Americans currently holding Obamacare health care coverage and an additional 10 million who qualify for expanded Medicaid still have coverage a year from now when the new Republican plan is phased in? If not, how many will be dropped from the rolls?\n\nIf someone is currently on either the traditional or expanded Medicaid program for low-income or disabled people, will he or she still have coverage once the Republicans cut and overhaul the programs and turn them into per capita payments or block grants to the states?\n\nWill consumers currently using Obamacare have to pay more in premiums and out-of-pocket costs their health care under the new system?\n\nWhat about sick and elderly people who currently are guaranteed health care coverage under Obamacare? What happens if they get shunted into federally funded, state-operated “high risk” pools as envisioned by the Republicans? If Congress subsequently cuts back funding for the risk pool, will the elderly be out of luck?"

    "text": "The New York Times describes 11 million people – those who are living in the country illegally – as sleepless with anxiety, waiting for the “fists pounding on the door, the agents in black, the van ride, the cell.” Who has thrown such fear into this community? How about the Left, aided and abetted by the liberal media, which has purposefully distorted President Trump’s immigration policies, characterizing them erroneously as a radical departure from past practices?\n\nIn a feverish blast to donors sent out yesterday, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee claims that “Donald Trump plans to add thousands of immigration agents and begin deporting “almost all” undocumented immigrants.”\n\nRelated: The Hidden Effect of Trump’s New Immigration Orders\n\nThat is, excuse the expression, fake news. Trump is doing no such thing. In fact, he recently hinted that he would most likely abide by President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, allowing the 740,000 people covered by that initiative to stay in the country. In addition, the new guidelines rolled out by Homeland Security indicate that people who have lived in the country for two years or more will not be vulnerable to “expedited removal.” Trump has also made it clear that he would prioritize deporting criminals.\n\nThe hysteria over recent ICE operations is a great example of how Trump’s policies are being misrepresented. Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested 680 individuals, “stoking fears that the Trump administration is increasing the arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants,” as The Times reported.\n\nAnother news organization proclaimed that “Panic” and “terror” is…running through immigrant communities in the US following raids carried out across at least six states as part of Donald Trump’s pledge to crack down on illegal immigrants.”\n\nBut the head of ICE in LA said, \"These operations take weeks and sometimes months of planning, so this operation was in the planning stages before the current administration came out with the executive orders.\" In other words, the raids had nothing to do with Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump to Spare U.S. 'Dreamer' Immigrants From Crackdown\n\nInstead, they were a continuation of Obama’s deportation program. It turns out that in 2009, ICE arrested on average 675 people per week. Under Obama, that figure rose to a weekly 771, after which the numbers began to taper off.\n\nBut a Government Accountability Office study shows that during fiscal years 2013 through 2015, “Border Patrol recorded a total of 2.1 million estimated known illegal entries between ports of entry along the southwest border.” The study was part of a GAO report on border fencing and security.\n\nHow is Trump actually changing Obama’s approach?\n\nIt is hard to document since Obama’s policies varied depending on how aggressively he was wooing Hispanic voters. Remember that Obama was called the “Deporter in Chief” by La Raza because his administration threw people out of the country at an unprecedented rate. As the LA Times noted last fall, “Since taking office in 2009, Obama has expelled 2.5 million people, more than any other president.”\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nOne supposed change highlighted by The New York Times yesterday is that under the new rules from Homeland Security, “anyone convicted of any criminal offense is vulnerable to deportation.” Under Obama, they claim, only “undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for removal.” But a study by the paper’s own reporters of some 3.2 million deportations shows that to be false.\n\nWriting in 2014, the paper stated, “Since President Obama took office, two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations or had no criminal record at all. Twenty percent — or about 394,000 — of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes, including drug-related offenses, the records show.”\n\nThe executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group, said in 2014: “For years, the Obama administration’s spin has been that they are simply deporting so-called ‘criminal aliens,’ but…In truth, this administration — more than any other — has devastated immigrant communities across the country, tearing families away from loved ones, simply because they drove without a license, or re-entered the country, desperately trying to be reunited with their family members.”\n\nA former Homeland Security official said at the time, “It would have been better for the administration to state its enforcement intentions clearly and stand by them, rather than being willing to lean whichever way seemed politically expedient at any given moment.”\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Ahead With Wall, Puts Stamp on U.S. Immigration, Security Policy\n\nThat is of course what the Trump White House is doing. One such “enforcement intention” is ending Obama’s “catch and release” program, in which illegals apprehended at the border are free to stay in the U.S. and told to appear in court at a later date for a review of their circumstances. Most people fail to show for their appointed hearing; instead, they disappear into the shadows.\n\nAlso, among those denied entry to the U.S., Trump’s order mandates repatriation back to their home countries. The administration thinks this is the best way to cut down on people arriving in the U.S. Send them home; others will get the message. The Obama administration also took that approach, when dealing with the surge in Central American refugees, but abandoned it in the face of criticism.\n\nTrump wants to add more border agents and more judges to expedite hearings and better manage the chaotic flow across our border. He calls on those officials to comply with the law – for example, to “end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.”\n\nMostly, Trump wants to tighten up enforcement of existing rules, a position the Left has found to be valuable fodder for their campaign to discredit the new president. Guadalupe Garcia de Reyos, a mother of two convicted of using a fake Social Security number who was recently deported after 8 years in the U.S. has become the poster child of the inhumanity of the Trump White House. Eleven-year-old Arlette Rocha, who hanged herself in 2010 because Obama’s team deported her father, is long forgotten.\n\nThese are real people with tragic stories; Americans are sympathetic. But they are also unhappy that our borders are porous. In fiscal 2016, border agents apprehended 409,000 illegals at the southern border alone. Brandon Judd, head of the National Border Control Council, claims that for every person caught, another gets into the country. If that is the case, in one year we have nearly half a million people who come in without proper papers. That is not the way a rule of law nation is supposed to function."

    "text": "Most of the attention being paid to the two memoranda from the Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that implements President Trump’s executive order on Immigration has focused on the elements of the directives that are clear and unambiguous. But immigrants’ rights activists are also worried about one section of the new instruction to the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that is rather vague.\n\nThe two memoranda, dated February 20, order numerous concrete moves by the agencies that enforce the country’s immigration laws. Both ICE and Customs and Border Protection have been instructed to build new detention facilities near the border with Mexico, presumably to accommodate a large influx of detainees. Immigration officers are given much wider latitude to initiate deportation proceedings, and plans are in process to ship undocumented immigrants back to their home countries before a court has heard their cases. And ICE is instructed to hire 10,000 new officers.\n\nRelated: Trump Scores a Bipartisan Win With His Pick for National Security Adviser\n\nAll of this and more has generated widespread angst in immigrant communities across the country. But another part of one of the orders is worrying immigrant activists who fear that it could have implications beyond run-of-the-mill arrests and deportations.\n\nSection D of the memo titled “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest” contains a directive for the establishment of a program meant to provide help and information to people who have been victims of criminal activity by undocumented immigrants. Known as the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, the program would be funded, at least in part, by eliminating services that provide assistance to undocumented individuals.\n\n“Criminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents,” the memo reads. “Often, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender's immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender.”\n\nTherefore, Kelly instructs ICE to create the VOICE office and to “reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens.\"\n\nRelated: White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force\n\nWhat exactly that means, though, is unclear to experts in immigration law and policy.\n\nWilliam A. Stock, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said that the language might refer to the remnants of the Office of the Public Advocate, a short-lived unit in ICE created to “serve as a point of contact for individuals, including those in immigration proceedings, NGOs, and other community and advocacy groups, who have concerns, questions, recommendations or important issues they would like to raise.”\n\nRepublicans in Congress immediately moved to defund the office, which many considered to be a taxpayer-funded advocate for illegal immigrants. Some of its operations were folded into the Office of Community Engagement within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations.\n\n“Some Republican House members, particularly Diane Black of Tennessee, accused the Public Advocate office of being able to ‘lobby for illegal immigrants, and since it was defunded, some anti-immigration advocates have charged that is what the Office of Community Engagement does,” said Stock.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nHe added, “In my experience, what OCE actually does is try to facilitate communication between ICE and communities of US citizens who may be affected by enforcement and removal actions, such as local law enforcement, local and state officials, and the broader community.”\n\nUndermining OCE, he said, in combination with an administration bent on visibly accelerating the rate of deportation, could lead to unfair proceedings.\n\n“I am concerned that pressure on ICE and CBP to achieve high removal numbers and create a climate of ‘enforcement only’ immigration actions will cause officers and leaders to give less consideration to humanitarian considerations and due process than is necessary for a fair removal process,” Stock said.\n\nOther immigrants’ rights activists said they were worried about how far into the system the directive to eliminate “advocacy” and “outreach” might reach.\n\nAvideh Moussavian, a policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, pointed out that the language in the administration’s policy pronouncements goes out of its way to describe a climate of criminality in the immigrant community.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\n“So much of the emphasis of the executive order and these implementing memos really reflects a strongly held belief that Americans are somehow at greater security risk because of the presence of non-citizens immigrants.”\n\nIn fact, Moussavian said, illegal immigrants are disproportionately victims of crime, because perpetrators assume they will be reluctant to go to the authorities.\n\n“Given their lack of status they are targeted,” she said. “Every day we hear stories of immigrants being targeted as victims of crime based on the perception that they are undocumented immigrants.”\n\nThere are actually special non-immigrant visas available to victims of crime. “T” visas are issued to some victims of human trafficking, while “U” visas are available to undocumented victims of various crimes in the US including domestic violence, assault, rape, involuntary servitude and more.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nOne question troubling activists now is whether “advocacy” and “outreach” include making victims of human trafficking aware of their potential eligibility for a T visa and providing them guidance? Or providing similar help to domestic abuse victims regarding their eligibility for a U visa?\n\nThe language in the implementing order is unclear, and ICE did not reply to a request for clarification.\n\n“While I know of no specific effort to curtail programs that make victims aware of immigration relief such as T and U visas, it is also true that letting them know of such relief and having them apply for it could slow down removal operations in those cases, which would harm the administration’s enforcement priority,” said Stock of AILA."

    "text": "The Trump administration offered a foretaste of its environmental policy with a speech on Tuesday by Scott Pruitt, the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Pruitt vowed to do as much to promote energy production and job creation as he would to protect against climate change.\n\nPruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry who made a career of challenging EPA’s clean air and water regulations, spelled out his management philosophy during his first speech to the agency’s15,000 employees.\n\nRelated: The Senate Just Confirmed the EPA’s Arch Enemy to Run the Agency\n\n“I believe that we as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and jobs, and pro-environment, that we don’t have to choose between the two,” Pruitt said during a relatively brief speech from EPA’s headquarters.\n\n“I think our nation has been better than any nation in the world at making sure that we do the job of protecting natural resources and protecting our environment, while also respecting the economic growth and jobs our nation seeks to have,” he said.\n\nPruitt, 48, used his position as state attorney general to sue the EPA at least 14 times – frequently in tandem with major fossil fuel companies that supported his elections. He is widely viewed as the chief architect of the assault against former President Barack Obama’s climate change policies that were aimed at sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s aging power plants.\n\nThe Washington Post reported yesterday that President Trump is preparing executive orders designed to curtail Obama-era policies on climate change and water pollution.\n\nRelated: A Climate Change Doubter Will Overhaul the EPA in Trump’s Administration\n\nOne of the orders will instruct the EPA to begin rewriting the 2015 regulation that limits greenhouse gas emissions from existing, coal-fired electric utilities. It also would order the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management to cancel a moratorium on federal coal leasing.\n\nThe other order will instruct the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to revamp the 2015 Waters of the United States rule that applies to 60 percent of the water bodies in the country. That regulation – which was issued under the 1972 Clean Water Act – gives the federal government authority over wetlands, rivers and streams as well as major water bodies, according to The Post.\n\nPruitt didn’t go into any details of the administration’s planned policy shift. Instead, he outlined the principles that will guide his tenure at the EPA, such as altering the regulatory process, adhering more closely to congressional mandates and deferring more to the states in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.\n\n“Regulations ought to make things regular,” Pruitt said. “Regulators exist to give certainty to those that they regulate. Those that we regulate ought to know what’s expected of them, so they can plan, and allocate resources to comply.”"

Biggs said Walmart was generally in favor of tax reform but not when it involved taxing imports.\n\nAn estimated 97% of all clothing and shoes sold in the US are imported, which is why such a change in US tax policy would most likely have a dramatic effect on Walmart, the world's largest clothing retailer.\n\nIf such a tax were introduced, Walmart would most likely need to either eat those costs and take a hit to profitability or pass the costs on to customers.\n\nBiggs made the comments on a call to discuss Walmart's fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nFor the quarter, revenue increased 1% to $130.9 billion, and US same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, jumped 1.8%, marking the biggest quarterly increase in four years.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "text": "Earlier this month, three Veterans Affairs Department employees in Little Rock, Arkansas, were indicted on federal charges of stealing prescription medications, including opioids, from a VA hospital and conspiring to distribute those drugs.\n\nThe three employees -- Satishkumar \"Steve\" Patel, 44, of North Little Rock, Alisha Pagan, 33, of Mabelvale, and Nikita Neal, 42, of Little Rock -- were arrested and charged with eight counts of illegally ordering oxycodone, hydrocodone, Viagra, Cialis and promethazine syrup with codeine and then diverting it for street distribution, according to the Justice Department.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nAs disturbing as case may be, it is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe U.S. is struggling with a surge in opioid addiction and illegal prescription drug trafficking, and VA hospitals throughout the country have experienced a sharp increase in opioid theft, misplaced or stolen prescriptions and unauthorized drug use by VA employees, as the Associated Press reported on Monday.\n\nIndeed, the number of reports of drug losses or thefts at federal hospitals increased from 272 in 2009 to 2,926 in 2015, before declining slightly to 2,457 last year, according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data obtained by the AP. Most of those federal hospitals are VA facilities, along with correctional facility hospitals and health care centers for Native Americans.\n\nRelated: US Death Rate From Heroin and Opioid Abuse Soars\n\nMaking matters worse, some of the VA hospitals have been careless in tracking their drug supplies, despite warnings from government auditors dating back to 2009 to tighten security.\n\n\"Drug theft is an area of concern,\" Jeffrey Hughes, the VA's acting assistant inspector general for investigations, told the AP. He said an improvement in the monthly inspections could help the VA uncover potential discrepancies and root out crime.\n\nIn the Little Rock case, the inspector general’s office opened an investigation in June 2016 after receiving a report that large amounts of unaccounted for prescription medications were being charged to accounts at the VA’s John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital.\n\nThe investigation subsequently revealed that Patel, a pharmacy technician, used his VA access to a medical supplier’s web portal “to order and divert 4,000 oxycodone pills, 3,300 hydrocodone pills, 308 ounces of promethazine with codeine syrup, and more than 14,000 Viagra and Cialis pills,” at a cost to the VA of roughly $77,700 dollars and an estimated street value of more than $160,000, according to the Justice Department.\n\nRelated: The US War on Drugs in Afghanistan Is an $8 Billion Failure\n\nPatel funneled the medications to Pagan, a pharmacy technician, who in turn distributed a portion of the drugs to Neal, a pharmacy technician trainee. All three defendants were charged with conspiring to steal the drugs and distribute oxycodone and hydrocodone, two of the most powerful, addictive and deadly drugs on the market.\n\nThe opioid addiction crisis that has swept the country became a major issue during the 2016 presidential campaign. The number of overdose deaths involving opioids increased from 28,647 in 2014 to 33,091 in 2015, an 8.9 percent rise, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Between 2011 and 2013, there were 13.4 deaths from drug overdoses for every 100,000 people.\n\nThe reports of rampant drug theft and distribution at veterans’ hospitals marks another black eye for the embattled VA, which is still trying to fully recover from a 2014 scandal revealing flagrant efforts to deny veterans speedy medical care and assistance.\n\nRelated: 44% of Americans Say They Know Someone Addicted to Pain Killers\n\nFormer Proctor & Gamble CEO Robert McDonald was brought in by President Obama as the new VA secretary to help clean up the mess. President Trump recently replaced McDonald with David Shulkin, a physician who had served as VA undersecretary."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/21/How-Medical-Marijuana-Can-Help-Reduce-Opioid-Crisis",
    "text": "After a 12-year battle with debilitating abdominal conditions that forced her to stop working, marijuana has helped Lynn Sabulski feel well enough to look for a job.\n\nSabulski is among nearly 14,000 patients in New York state who are certified to use medical marijuana for one of 10 conditions, including her primary diagnosis, inflammatory bowel disease. Marijuana doesn’t address her underlying disease, but it does relieve her painful symptoms.\n\nRelated: How West Virginia Became Ground Zero for the Opioid Epidemic\n\nNationwide, an estimated 1.4 million patients in 28 states and the District of Columbia use legal medical marijuana for a varying list of conditions. A much smaller number of patients in 16 states use limited extracts of the plant, primarily to treat seizure disorders.\n\nIn the midst of an opioid crisis, some medical practitioners and researchers believe that greater use of marijuana for pain relief could result in fewer people using the highly addictive prescription painkillers that led to the epidemic.\n\nA 2016 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that states with medical marijuana laws had 25 percent fewer opioid overdose deaths than states that do not have medical marijuana laws. And another study published in Health Affairs last year found that prescriptions for opioid painkillers such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet paid for by Medicare dropped substantially in states that adopted medical marijuana laws.\n\nIn December, the New York Health Department said it would start allowing some patients with certain types of chronic pain to use marijuana as long as they have tried other therapies. The state’s original medical marijuana law, along with those in Connecticut, Illinois, New Hampshire and New Jersey, did not include chronic pain as an allowable condition for marijuana use, in part over concerns that such a broad category of symptoms could result in widespread and potentially inappropriate use of the controversial medicine.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nAdvocates for greater use of medical marijuana argue that including chronic pain as an allowable condition could result in even further reductions in dangerous opioid use.\n\nBut some physicians remain cautious about recommending the botanical medicine as a pain management tool.\n\nScant Research\n\nDr. Jane Ballantyne, a pain specialist at the University of Washington and president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, which promotes the use of alternatives to opioids for chronic pain, said she does not recommend that her patients try marijuana.\n\n“There is no doubt marijuana is much safer than opiates. So we don’t discourage its use.” But in general, she said, “non-drug treatments are far more helpful than any drug treatment, and marijuana is a drug.”\n\nAt Mount Sinai Hospital here in the city, Dr. Houman Danesh, director of integrative pain management, suggests patients try physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture, stem cell therapy, nutrition counseling, hypnosis and behavioral health counseling before resorting to opioids or any other medications. He said lack of sufficient research to back up marijuana’s safety and efficacy has kept him from adding it to his pain management toolkit, but he doesn’t rule it out in the near future.\n\nIn January, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a review of 10,000 medical marijuana studies published since 1999, showing that substantial evidence supports the use of marijuana or its extracts for the treatment of chronic pain. Existing research also supports its effectiveness in treating multiple-sclerosis-related muscle spasms and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, according to the literature review. But the study cautioned that both the positive and negative health effects of marijuana need to be studied further.\n\nRelated: States Worry That Obamacare Repeal Could Hurt Opioid Addiction Efforts\n\nHistorically, research on marijuana has been hamstrung by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which classifies marijuana along with heroin and LSD as illegal substances with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” As a result, the supply of legal marijuana that can be studied and federal funds to pursue academic research are limited.\n\nSlow and Cautious\n\nSince 1996, when California voters ushered in the first law legalizing medical marijuana, the progression of states adopting similar laws has been slow and steady. California’s law was only one paragraph long and it didn’t limit the use of marijuana to any specific conditions. Since then, most state laws have included more detail about marijuana’s allowable uses.\n\nEnacted in 2014, New York’s medical marijuana law is considered among the most cautious in the nation. Americans for Safe Access, a patient advocacy group, gives the state a letter grade of C when it comes to balancing product safety and ease of access to the emerging medicine.\n\nNew York allows doctors to certify patients to purchase marijuana at a limited number of highly regulated dispensaries — 20 statewide, including four in New York City — for the treatment of 10 conditions: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord damage, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies and Huntington’s disease.\n\nIn the fall, after two years of operation, the state health agency declared its medical marijuana program a success and expanded its rules to allow nurse practitioners to certify patients for marijuana use. The state also approved home delivery for patients too ill to travel and announced it would certify more manufacturers of marijuana extracts to increase the supply of tinctures, liquid capsules, sprays and vape cartridges available for patients who rely on them.\n\nRelated: The Tiniest Victims of the Heroin Crisis: A Baby With Opioid Withdrawal Is Born Every 25 Minutes\n\nRemarkable Results\n\nSibulski’s physician, Dr. Howard Shapiro, started certifying patients for marijuana about a year ago and quickly became a believer. He’s one of only 371 doctors out of nearly 33,000 in the city’s five boroughs registered to certify patients for medical marijuana. Statewide, only 863 out of roughly 96,000 physicians have signed up for the program.\n\nTechnically, doctors can’t prescribe marijuana for their patients because federal law prohibits it. But under New York and most other state laws, doctors can verify that patients are suffering from an allowable condition, which authorizes patients to purchase marijuana on their own at a regulated dispensary. So far, Medicaid, Medicare and most private insurance do not cover medical marijuana, so patients must pay out of pocket.\n\nAs a primary care doctor who takes a holistic approach to medicine, Shapiro said trying medical marijuana was a natural for him. But he said he worried that “a bunch of druggies would start showing up.” Instead, he said the patients he began seeing were all very sick and none of them appeared to be seeking drugs for fun. The improvement he saw in those first patients was remarkable, he said.\n\n“I really think medical marijuana is the drug of the future,” Shapiro said. “We’re going to find out that it does a lot of things we already think it can do, but don’t have scientific studies to prove it.”\n\nOut of 109 patients he’s seen over the past year, all but a handful reported substantial improvement in their pain and other symptoms within a month or two of using medical marijuana, he said.\n\nFor Shapiro’s patients, the cost of marijuana treatment ranges from $300 to $400 a month, depending on their level of use. Sibulski said her monthly bill is about $400.\n\nRelated: 44% of Americans Say They Know Someone Addicted to Pain Killers\n\n“I urge my patients to purchase only a two-week supply at first, so they don’t waste money on a dose that may not be effective,” Shapiro said. Most patients start out with a 1-to-1 ratio of THC, the intoxicating component of marijuana, to CBD, the second major component, which has proven to be medically effective for a range of conditions.\n\nPatients typically need to work with the dispensary to adjust their ratio so that the medication alleviates their symptoms but doesn’t get them too high to function, Shapiro explained. It’s a trial-and-error process, he said.\n\nMost marijuana patients take a tincture or liquid capsule every four to six hours during the day and use a vape pen to inhale a faster-acting dose of marijuana extract when they have breakthrough symptoms. Sibulski said she uses a vape pen before she gets out of bed in the morning, because it almost instantly wards off her abdominal spasms. She then takes an oral dose, which kicks in within one to two hours.\n\nLast Resort\n\nAt 36, when she quit her job last year, Sibulski said she feared she would be permanently disabled and never be able to return to work. She had seen multiple specialists and tried a medicine cabinet full of prescribed drugs, including OxyContin and muscle relaxers, to relieve her pain and abdominal spasms, but nothing worked.\n\nOnce she was unemployed, Sibulski said she experimented on her own with street-purchased marijuana and found that it worked better than anything else she had tried. But she couldn’t control the potency of what she was smoking, so sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t, and sometimes it made her too high to function.\n\nStill, she felt well enough to return to work and started applying for jobs. That’s when she realized she couldn’t pass a drug test, which she said most employers she spoke to required.\n\nIn December, Sibulski found Shapiro through a Yelp listing and brought him her medical files so he could consider certifying her to use pharmaceutical-grade marijuana. Working with him and a pharmacist at a dispensary in Queens, she said she found the perfect combination of THC and CBD to keep her symptoms at bay while allowing her to be highly functional.\n\n“It’s been life-changing,” she said. As a certified marijuana patient, she’s hoping potential employers will waive that part of the drug test.\n\nDr. Stephen Dahmer, a primary care doctor and chief medical officer of Vireo Health of New York, one of five state-approved medical marijuana producers, said Sibulski’s story is typical.\n\n“Many marijuana patients are what we call the ‘intractables.’ They try everything the medical system has to offer, and they finally find relief from medical cannabis,” he said.\n\nDahmer says he agrees with the state’s cautious approach. “We physicians take an oath to ‘do no harm.’ But unfortunately, he said, it means a lot of patients who could benefit from marijuana aren’t getting access to it. “It’s my hope that the door will open wider in the future and medical marijuana will become a first-line treatment.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

    "text": "In a moment that may feel unfamiliar to the nascent Trump administration, the president’s choice to fill the shoes of departed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is drawing almost uniform praise from people on both sides of the partisan divide.\n\nSome of President Trump’s appointees have provoked feelings of dread, like putting fossil fuel crusader Scott Pruitt at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency. Others have caused puzzlement, like putting celebrated neurosurgeon Ben Carson in charge at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nRelated: F-18 vs. F-35: Why Is Trump Talking Up the Super Hornet?\n\nThe announcement on Sunday that Trump had chosen Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to be his closest adviser (officially, at least) on matters of national security -- and the news that, unlike a previous well-qualified candidate, he had accepted -- generated something close to a sigh of relief in the national security community.\n\nThe 54-year-old Philadelphia native has served in the Army for more than 30 years, and has a long history of brilliance both on the battlefield and in academia. He distinguished himself in both the first and second Iraq wars. In 1991, as a captain leading a tank unit in the Battle of 73 Easting, he oversaw a decisive victory over a numerically superior Iraqi force. In 2004, as a colonel, he oversaw the pacification of the city of Tal Afar, which became a case study in fighting insurgencies.\n\nBetween those deployments, McMaster earned a Ph.D. in military history from the University of North Carolina. His dissertation on the failure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to stand up to the Lyndon Johnson administration during an escalation of the Vietnam War that he saw as hopeless turned into the bestselling book Dereliction of Duty.\n\nSen. John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been free with his criticism of the Trump administration in recent weeks, but he had nothing but praise for this move. “I give President Trump great credit for this decision,” he said after the announcement on Sunday.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became the Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, the hawkish lawmaker from Arkansas, served in the Army with McMaster, and reportedly pressed the Trump administration to hire him. He described the general as ““one of the finest combat leaders of our generation and also a great strategic mind. He is a true warrior scholar.”\n\nOn Twitter, Susan Rice, who served as President Obama’s National Security Adviser, wrote, “Congrats to Lt Gen McMaster. I wish you every success as National Security Advisor. Hope you will be able to choose your team, have direct reporting and daily access to POTUS, and can eliminate Strategic Initiatives Group. Please trust, empower, support the extraordinary professional, largely career NSC staff. They won't let you down.”\n\nRice was referring to two things that have caused concern among national security professionals. The Strategic Initiatives Group is an assemblage of administration employees centered on White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. It is largely seen as a shadow National Security Council that might challenge the authority of the real NSC, which McMaster will chair.\n\n“I have a lot of respect for HR,” Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under President Obama, wrote on Twitter. “HR will not roll over and salute Bannon.”\n\nRice had also been referring to the tension over NSC staffing that has characterized the search for Flynn’s replacement. One candidate, retired Admiral Robert Harward, reportedly turned down the job in part because he was told that he would not have full control over who served on his staff.\n\nRelated: Why Can’t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nOn Sunday, prior to the announcement that McMaster had been selected, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that the administration’s position was now that the new national security adviser would have full authority to staff the NSC in the way he or she saw fit.\n\nMcMaster’s appointment will go a long way toward calming national security professionals who were genuinely distressed at the prospect of Flynn running the NSC. A retired general, Flynn has shadowy connections to the leadership of Russia, and was given to tweeting out conspiracy theories during the presidential campaign."

The survey was conducted Feb. 1-5, before what looked like a North Korean-ordered assassination of Kim’s estrange half-brother in a Malaysian airport, and North Korea’s testing of a ballistic missile in violation of U.N. resolutions while the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was conferring with President Trump in Florida.\n\nTrump has done a little saber rattling with North Korea, declaring that the latest missile test was “absolutely intolerable.” But it’s far from clear what Trump can do to deter the North Korean leader’s drive to become the biggest nuclear weapons bully on the block."

    "text": "Republicans are not so much a political party as a loose affiliation of people interested in giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Grover Norquist genetically manufactured the entire caucus in a lab to robotically give speeches about how tax cuts spawn economic growth. So why are Republicans having such a tough time coming up with a viable tax cut plan?\n\nThe answer lies with the Republican’s inability to say no to anyone. They have played Santa Claus for so long, promising to pull an endless supply of free money out of their white sack, they cannot comprehend the very concept of a trade-off.\n\nThe House Republican tax rewrite looks very familiar. A full 99.6 percent of its benefits flow to the wealthy, according to analysis from the Tax Policy Center. It would cut individual, corporate and capital gains rates, and eliminate the tax on inheritances. It would increase the deficit by more than $3 trillion in the first decade. That sounds like a re-run of George W. Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which failed to stimulate much growth but made the very wealthy very happy.\n\nThere’s a new wrinkle this time: a controversial measure called a border adjustment tax, which exempts exports from taxation while effectively imposing a 20 percent tax on imports.\n\nRelated: Why Ryan’s ‘Border Adjustment’ Import Tax Is So Controversial\n\nAnyone claiming they know the consequences of this isn’t telling the truth. Many assume raising taxes on imports and lowering them on exports will boost domestic manufacturing and reverse the trade deficit. But some economists believe that the dollar would grow stronger in reaction, making domestic products more expensive and wiping out the benefit, while also straining emerging markets that carry debt based in dollars. Others disagree that the effects on trade would cancel out, because countries would act to prevent the strong dollar impacts. In that scenario, consumer-facing importers like retailers and gas companies could pass on the tax in the form of higher prices, shifting the burden to their customers. Or, by simplifying the collection of tax, the real losers could be companies that manipulate the system. Oh yeah, the whole thing might also be illegal under global trade rules.\n\nThis uncertainty has created political enemies for the border tax, particularly among powerful businesses that import a lot of goods. They aren’t buying the argument that exchange rates will save their business model, or that they could quickly shift production to the U.S. to compensate. So retailers have formed anti-border tax lobbying coalitions, using the potential for higher consumer prices as a key talking point. Retail executives met with Trump to express their dismay last week. Koch Industries, a major oil importer, has also pushed hard against the provision. Domestic manufacturers, meanwhile, are supporting the border tax with their own front groups, signaling a lobbyist battle royale in which Congress simply tries to negotiate between competing corporate interests.\n\nRetailers have found success among Republican senators, who aren’t as wedded to the tax plan. Utah’s Orrin Hatch, who chairs the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, isn’t taking a position on border adjustment yet. But Georgia Sen. David Perdue stated flatly that the tax “is a bad idea and should not become a permanent part of the tax code.” Perdue was the longtime CEO of Dollar General, a low-margin retailer that imports almost everything, precisely the type of company worried by this idea.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Border Tax Could Sink Paul Ryan’s Fiscal Plan\n\nAfter House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to calm nerves in a closed-door Senate meeting, Sen. Tom Cotton, who represents Walmart’s home state of Arkansas, defied him on the Senate floor. Cotton said he and his colleagues “will not keep our powder dry and see working Americans railroaded with a precooked deal that raises their taxes and increases the prices of the stuff they buy every single day.” President Trump’s economic advisers are split on the idea, and when his tax blueprint is released in a couple weeks, it may or may not include border adjustment.\n\nIf this import tax causes so much strain among Republicans and their corporate benefactors, why are they bothering with it? The biggest reason is that, because of our current trade deficit, a tax on imports looks like it raises over a trillion dollars, allowing Republicans to plow more money into tax cuts for the rich. I say “looks like” because again, we don’t know how border adjustment will play out. But the way budget scoring works, with its focus on the current baseline, ensures that border adjustment appears to raise money. It’s a gimmick, but one Republicans need to make their plan work.\n\nOffsetting the tax cuts satisfies an anti-deficit Tea Party faction, while helping solve the biggest problem with avoiding a Democratic filibuster. Under budget reconciliation, Republicans can pass big tax cuts with only 50 Senate votes. However, under reconciliation rules they cannot pass a plan that increases the deficit after the first 10 years. The Bush tax cuts, also passed under reconciliation, simply phased out after 10 years to meet this obligation. But offsetting tax cuts with revenue-raisers in the out years can also be part of the solution.\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\nRepublicans don’t have a Plan B for raising a trillion dollars. A previous tax code rewrite included a bank tax; Wall Street opposed it. Another lengthened the time for depreciation of assets for write-offs; multinational corporations with major equipment investments opposed it. There’s always the option of not offsetting any of the tax cuts and claiming that massive economic growth will pay for everything. But Congress’ budget scorers can’t fully comply with this directive, making that trillion dollars critical to building a revenue-neutral plan that can be made permanent in reconciliation.\n\nThis is where Republicans run into an uncomfortable fact: They don’t want to say no to anyone. In a very real sense they don’t believe they have to.\n\nConservative economic theory has become so corrupted by the idea that tax cuts solve everything that an overhaul of the tax code creating winners and losers does not compute. Republicans don’t want to upset the retailers or the manufacturers, the wealthy or the middle class, the budget hawks or the military spenders. So they’ve concocted an elaborate fantasy world, where nobody has to be damaged by radical shifts in the tax code that transfer wealth upwards.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Budget Cuts Distract from Nation’s Much Larger Fiscal Problems\n\nThis problem has spilled over into the Obamacare replacement as well. Republicans want to repeal the taxes that fund Obamacare — all of which fall on the wealthy — in part to create a lower revenue baseline for their tax plan. But they still have to find some money to fund a replacement. The biggest funding source available comes from limiting the tax break on employer-based health insurance, which cost $216 billion just last year. But that would hit workers with huge taxes on their health care and a likely loss of coverage for many.\n\nWithout Obamacare repeal resetting the revenue base, tax reform is really in peril. Republicans may go from two huge legislative victories to none. And that’s because they have no interest in legislating, particularly in navigating the often painful compromises that necessarily result. It’s a funny thing about running the government — you have to govern."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/21/Why-Ryan-s-Border-Adjustment-Import-Tax-So-Controversial",
    "text": "The centerpiece of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s major corporate tax reform – a 20 percent “border adjustment” tax on all imported goods to help offset the more than $1.2 trillion cost of across the board tax cuts for corporations and individuals—just took another hit over the weekend.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Sunday during an appearance on the CBS News’ Face the Nation that the House plan won’t garner even 10 votes in the Senate, where the Republicans currently hold a 52 to 48 seat advantage over the Democrats.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Border Tax Could Sink Paul Ryan’s Fiscal Plan\n\n“The Congress is stumbling,” Graham said. “Republicans in the Congress – we’re all tied up in knots. The House is talking about a tax plan that won’t get 10 votes in the Senate.” Graham echoed the assessment of Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) last week that the border adjustment tax idea was on “life support” in the Senate.\n\nIf Graham and Cornyn are correct, then the growing resistance to the House plan among lawmakers and corporate executives could greatly complicate – or even sidetrack – the efforts by President Trump and GOP leaders to push through the first major reforms of the federal tax code since 1986. That includes repealing taxes associated with Obamacare as well lowering corporate and individual taxes.\n\nHowever, without the border adjustment tax provision, which is estimated to raise more than $1.2 trillion over the coming decade, the amount that will be needed to offset the massive tax cuts would raise the deficit even further.\n\nRyan and Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) wrote last year, in first announcing their plan, “From the perspective of America’s place in the global economy, the new tax system will focus on investment in America and investment for America.”\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\n“The focus on business cash flow, which is a move toward a consumption-based approach to taxation, will allow the United States to adopt, for the first time in history, the same destination-based approach to taxation that has long been used by our trading partners.,” they added. “This will end the self-imposed unilateral penalty for exports and subsidy for imports that are fundamental flaws in the current U.S. tax system.”\n\nBut the border adjustment idea is proving to be a tough sell. And even Trump, who is eager to push through a major tax cut this year, has said that Ryan’s plan may be “too complicated” to sell to Congress and the public.\n\nSo what exactly is Ryan’s plan, what would it do, and why is it so controversial? Here is a layman’s guide to the plan.\n\nHow would the border adjustment work? It would alter the current corporate tax structure by essentially imposing a tax or levy of 20 percent on all imports – including components and parts used in assembly – while exempting U.S. exporters from any taxes. Viewed another way, U.S. companies would no longer have to report revenue generated by their overseas sales as taxable income, but for the same token, they could no longer claim expenses incurred by importing goods and materials as deductible from their federal tax obligation.\n\n“This would shift the current corporate income tax from an origin-based tax—one that applies to the production of goods and services in the United States—to a destination-based tax—one that applies to the consumption of goods and services in the United State,” according to a Tax Foundation analysis.\n\nRelated: Ryan Declares GOP Has a ‘Mandate’ to Enact Sweeping Changes\n\nWhy is it so controversial? The proposed border adjustment is arguably the most revolutionary idea in corporate tax reform movement in decades and – if approved – would transform the corporate income tax code into something similar to the European value-added tax or VAT.\n\nRyan argues that his plan is needed to rectify a trade disadvantage that the current tax system creates for U.S. producers. While most countries levy taxes based on consumption within their borders, the United States taxes its companies based on their income -- including from exports. As a result, he says, U.S. exporters get hit with taxes at home and abroad, putting them at a huge competitive disadvantage.\n\nHowever, Ryan’s plan would also, overnight, create new categories of corporate winners and losers and invariably drive up prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nWho would benefit most from the change? Clearly, the border adjustment approach would be a boon to export-driven companies, including manufacturers of electronic equipment, machinery, aircraft, munitions, cars, and tobacco. American companies shipped $1.4 trillion worth of goods around the globe in 2016, down slightly from previous years. Supporters of the House plan say it would encourage domestic investment and reward companies that manufacture in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Budget Cuts Distract from Nation’s Much Larger Fiscal Problems\n\nWho would be the biggest losers? Any business that relies heavily on imports would be stung by the border adjustment tax, and that includes retailers, foreign car dealers, toy manufacturers and oil refineries. Major retailers like Wal-Mart and Target that obtain many of their products from Asia and other markets with cheap labor would be hard hit by the border adjustment.\n\nCompanies heavily reliant on imports would no longer be able to deduct their import costs as a regular business expense and would have no choice but to pass on their added tax obligation to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, recently told the Wall Street Journal that his members view the proposed 20 percent tax on imports as “a very, very serious potential blow to the auto sector and the economy.”\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-GA), the former top executive of Dollar General and Reebok, has led the opposition to Ryan’s plan and recently described it in a letter to colleagues as a regressive plan that “hammers consumers,” according to The Hill.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\nWould the border adjustment tax strengthen or weaken the dollar? Ryan and other proponents contend that their plan would result in a stronger U.S. dollar, which in turn would somewhat ameliorate the economic disparities between the winners and losers. A stronger dollar would make imports less expensive and exports costlier. That change alone would negate the tax’s effect on importers and exporters, according to Bloomberg. However, opponents say it’s not as simple as that, and that other factors can alter currency valuations."

    "text": "Under other circumstances, comments about Vice President Mike Pence made by Rep. Adam Schiff on Sunday morning would have seemed uncharitable at best, or malicious at worst. The California congressman, who serves as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that the leaders of US allies meeting with Pence in Europe can’t trust that what they hear from him reflects the intentions of the Trump administration.\n\nSpeaking from Berlin, where he was attending an annual conference on international security, Schiff said, “There’s a lot of concern here about just who speaks for the administration and certainly even when things -- when the vice president or others say the right things, they wonder, does the president stand behind this?”\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nPence, also attending the conference, had delivered a speech two days earlier restating the commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance -- an organization President Trump had called “obsolete” during his campaign for the Oval Office.\n\nPence had arrived in Munich just days after it was revealed that Trump had waited 14 days before informing his own vice president that Pence had been lied to by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn about discussions with a Russian diplomat. The incident raised questions about whether or not Pence was actually part of the administration’s inner circle.\n\nSo, listeners were wary when he announced, “Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: the United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in our commitment to this transatlantic alliance.”\n\nHe added an assurance that the US will stand up to Russian aggression, saying, “Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found.”\n\nRelated: F-18 vs. F-35: Why Is Trump Talking Up the Super Hornet?\n\nSchiff described the reaction of the audience, made up of prime ministers, defense ministers, and other senior leaders, as “subdued.” Reporting from Munich, the Reuters news service agreed, calling Pence’s reception “tepid.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” said host Jonathan Karl. “Vice President Pence said quite clearly in that speech that the United States stands with NATO. You’re saying that people didn’t buy it?”\n\n“Yes. And [US Ambassador to the United Nations] Nikki Haley said that, that we don’t recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea. But that still begs the question, is the vice president or Nikki Haley really speaking for the president?” Schiff said.\n\n“I think certainly here at the conference when Mike Pence said that we want NATO members to pay up, they knew, in that case, he was speaking for the president. But when he talked about American commitment to NATO, when he talked about the commitment to Europe, I think there are still profound questions about whether he is, in those cases, really speaking for the president or speaking for himself.”\n\nRelated: Does Anyone Still Want to Work for the Trump Administration?\n\nSchiff’s comments could easily be dismissed as a partisan effort to undermine the administration, except that, based on comments from other leaders in attendance, they seem to be accurate.\n\n“We are waiting for actions,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said, according to the Associated Press. “We only know what the media has reported and the statements that we've got. Now we are waiting for actions of the new government of Donald Trump.”\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that he spoke personally with Pence and other US officials, and came away certain only that they were expressing their own intentions -- but not necessarily the administration’s.”\n\n\"I have no doubts that the American vice president, and also the defense minister, will do everything to take responsibility within NATO as in the past, and I don't think there is a big argument inside the American government,” he said\n\nRelated: North Korea’s Missile Test Leaves Trump with Three Options\n\nPressed by reporters to say whether or not he thought Trump would stand behind the vice president’s comments, he said, “Since I haven't spoken to him, I can only say what I discussed with Mr. Pence — I did that and there are no doubts there.”\n\nSimilar uncertainty appeared to follow Pence when he made his way to Brussels on Monday for a meeting with top leaders of the European Union. During the election, Trump had cheered the vote by the United Kingdom to break off from the EU and had suggested that further deterioration of the union was likely.\n\nIn remarks there, Pence stressed the need for continued close cooperation between the US and the EU. His words were met with a polite wait-and-see reception.\n\n“After such a positive declaration, both the Europeans and the Americans must simply practice what they preach,” said European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nRelated: White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force\n\nPence’s credibility, particularly his promise to “hold Russia accountable” had taken another blow the night before with the revelation by The New York Times of a back-channel plan to lift sanctions on Russia in exchange for unspecified concessions from Moscow in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The war, which started when Russia invaded the Crimean Peninsula, has cost an estimated 10,000 lives.\n\nHowever, according to The Times, the deal was developed by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Felix H. Sater, a Russian-American businessman with past criminal convictions and ties to both Trump and organized crime, and Andrii V. Artemenko, a Ukrainian politician who claims the current president in Kiev is corrupt and who has no authority from his government to negotiate a peace deal.\n\nThere is no indication that Trump himself has seen the plan or approved of it in any way. However, the news that people close to the administration appear to be freelancing on the most explosive issue in Europe right now can’t be reassuring to US allies in the region.\n\nAnd it can’t make Mike Pence’s mission to sooth them much easier, either."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/20/How-Public-Employee-Pensions-Make-Income-Inequality-Worse",
    "text": "Despite the stock market’s strong performance, public employee pension systems remain well below full funding and pressure on government budgets is building. Get ready for another round of battles over public employee benefits.\n\nThis month, UC Berkeley’s Haas Institute, a progressive research center, has stepped into the maelstrom, arguing that the problem is overblown. In a policy brief, analyst Tom Sgouros correctly points out that a pension plan need not be fully funded to continue making payments over long periods of time, and even questions whether 100 percent funding is an appropriate objective.\n\nWhile Sgouros and like-minded public finance experts make some valid points, they may be surprised to learn that public employee pensions are becoming a driver of income inequality.\n\nRelated: Ratings Agency Sends a Dire Warning About Trump's Economic Plan\n\nSgouros is right that, for most governments, pension underfunding is a not a near term solvency issue. Take CalPERS, the nation’s largest public pension system, as an example. Although only 73 percent funded, CalPERS is far from broke. As of June 30, 2016, it had $299 billion in net assets. In 2016, CalPERS collected $15 billion in member and employer contributions, while incurring $21 billion in benefit and administrative costs. Since 2007, contributions have been increasing at a 5 percent annual rate while expenses have been rising 8 percent a year. Over the long term, this is unsustainable, but a crisis is far in the future. Assuming expenses and contributions continue growing at historical rates and investment returns are zero, CalPERS would not run out of money until 2032.\n\nSuggestions that the nation is facing a wave of pension-driven municipal bankruptcies are overheated. We have not seen a major city bankruptcy since mid-2013, and it is not clear that the few bona fide government financial crises that have occurred over the last decade were primarily the result of pension underfunding. Flat or declining revenue and a failure to maintain adequate general fund reserves better explain fiscal emergencies that confronted Vallejo, Stockton, San Bernardino, Detroit and Puerto Rico in recent years. Pension obligations come due over an extended time frame and at highly predictable rates, so it is hard to imagine them triggering an emergency without one or more other factors coming into play.\n\nFiscal hawks like me are prone to exaggerate the pension funding crisis for a variety of reasons. Many of us have accounting and financial management backgrounds, which engender a strong preference for balanced books. The fact that politicians make pension promises without setting aside enough funds to cover them under conservative assumptions is morally offensive. For us, witnessing that type of behavior is akin to an environmentalist seeing a smoke stack belching out greenhouse gases. Like the environmentalist anxious to draw public attention to climate change, we want the public to share our concerns about fiscal unsustainability — and can sometimes omit necessary nuance from our arguments.\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem — Here Are the Worst 10\n\nBut critiques of pension funding may have pecuniary motives in some cases. For example, if governments can be convinced to increase funding levels, that means pension systems will have more money to allocate to mutual funds and other money managers. Since these financial players normally quote their fees as a percentage of assets under management, more pension funding leads to higher revenues.\n\nIf government agencies can be convinced to replace their defined benefit programs with defined contribution plans, financial interests stand to make even more money. Individually managed employer-sponsored retirement plans — known as 401(k) plans in the private sector — generate substantial fees for the firms that manage them. The median management fee for a 401(k) plan is 0.67 percent of fund assets, while the expense ratio for equity funds offered by 401(k) plans averages 0.53 percent. Combining these two amounts, we find that plan participants pay about 1.20 percent annually in overhead for shareholdings in a defined contribution plan. This compares with an average management overhead for defined benefits plans of only 0.43 percent. So moving employees from defined benefit to defined contribution plans can provide a windfall to the financial industry.\n\nPensions and Income Inequality\n\nAlthough progressives may be right that the sky isn’t falling, they may be surprised to learn about the impact that certain pensions have on income inequality. In California, over 50,000 public sector retirees are receiving annual pension benefits in excess of $100,000 — and in many cases, way over $100,000. In a new video, California Policy Center profiles four retirees receiving up to $350,000 annually.\n\nRelated: $1.7 Trillion in Unfunded State Pensions Is Squeezing Vital Public Programs\n\nThese high-income beneficiaries are not the clerks, caregivers and bus drivers typically represented by unions like AFSCME and SEIU. Instead, they are retired managers, academics, physicians and public safety officers. Among the retired police and fire officers, many put in 30 years of service earning retirement credits at a rate of 3 percent per year. This entitles them to retire at 90 percent of final compensation, which is often “spiked” through last-minute promotions and payouts for unused sick and vacation time. The average California Highway Patrol officer who has retired since 1999 receives $96,270 per year and more than 1,000 CHP retirees collect over $100,000 annually.\n\nSenior managers at public agencies have the power to affect retirement rules, allowing them to cash out in the process. In 2004, administrators in the inland California city of Redding convinced Council members to approve a supplementary retirement benefit program offered by Public Agency Retirement Services (PARS). A year-and-a-half later, Redding City Manager Mike Warren retired. Now, in addition to his annual CalPERS benefit of $198,000, he receives $50,000 each year from PARS. Warren’s total pension income of $248,000 annually is almost six times Redding’s median household income of $43,000. Meanwhile, the city now has to contribute $6 million per year to fund its supplementary pensions, a large burden for a struggling community of 92,000 people.\n\nPolicy Options\n\nReformers and progressives may be able to agree on policies that rein in the biggest pension payouts, as a matter of fairness and to free up public funds for other uses. But changes designed to contain windfall pension benefits are difficult to implement in states that have adopted the California Rule, which protects public sector workers from reductions in retirement benefits.\n\nRelated: The Retirement Revolution That Failed — Why the 401(k) Isn’t Working\n\nOne option that may get around this restriction is to impose a surtax on retirement benefits exceeding a certain level. For example, a state could tax retirement benefits over $100,000 at a rate of 25 percent, and benefits over $200,000 at a marginal rate of 50 percent. Such a tax would not impact anyone receiving a pension of $100,000 or less. If enacted, this policy would have to survive a California Rule court challenge and address the risk of retirees moving out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nAnother idea is to implement some form of risk sharing for benefits above a certain level. One problem with most defined-benefit plans is that taxpayers are on the hook when pension assets don’t grow at the sometimes lofty rates assumed. It may be fair to provide this type of security to public employees at lower income levels, but, at some point, funding this guarantee becomes regressive: with low-income city residents paying extra sales taxes to guarantee large pension payouts.\n\nA way to address this inequity is to limit the annual service credit pension formula to salaries up to $50,000. For income above that level, member and employer pension contributions would be held in a separate account that grows at the same rate as that earned by the pension system. At retirement, this balance would then be annuitized and paid on top of the guaranteed benefit. This proposal has some similarities to a defined contribution approach, but the money remains in the public employee pension system, avoiding extra fees.\n\nPublic employee pensions are unlikely to trigger a tsunami of municipal bankruptcies any time soon, but the need to fund these plans is placing pressure on local government budgets and crowding out other spending priorities. Under the circumstances, it seems fair to ask higher income pension beneficiaries and future beneficiaries to contribute to a solution."

    "text": "White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, during multiple appearances today on the Sunday talk shows, stopped just short of agreeing with his boss President Trump that the media is the “enemy of the American people” and is no longer a credible news source.\n\nContrary to Trump’s unprecedented rants against the news media – most recently during his 45-minute, campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday before an adoring crowd of 9,000 – Priebus insisted that Trump still supports the First Amendment. “He believes in the free press,” Priebus declared but stressed the media is biased on both sides of the ideological spectrum.\n\nRelated: How John McCain Became The Face of GOP Resistance to Trump\n\nThe former Republican National Committee chair offered a full-throated defense of Trump’s complaints about “fake news,” especially a New York Times report last week that members of Trump’s campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the November 8 election.\n\nPriebus dismissed the newspaper’s story – based on intelligence intercepts that were described to The Times by unnamed sources – as “garbage” and totally unfounded.\n\n“I can assure you, and I’ve been approved to say this, that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that the story is not only inaccurate but it’s grossly overstated,” Priebus said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. “If I can say that to the American people, then what does it say about the story?”\n\nThe Times reported that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee. According to the newspaper, the intelligence agencies then sought to determine whether the Trump campaign was “colluding with the Russians” on the hacking or other efforts to help Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nRelated: Does Anyone Still Want to Work for the Trump Administration?\n\nThe Times’ story was part of a much larger tableau of recent damaging news reports and leaks about disarray within the White House and troubling questions about several pre-inaugural phone calls between Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn.\n\nFlynn was forced to resign last week under pressure from Trump after he was caught lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the contents of those calls. A big unanswered question was whether Flynn intended to send a signal to Russia that Trump intended to lift the sanctions Obama had imposed for meddling in the US election after Trump took office.\n\nPence was kept in the dark by Flynn and Trump about the contents of the conversations and went on television Jan. 15 to say the sanctions hadn’t been discussed. Priebus said today that he first learned that Flynn had discussed the sanction with Kislyak sometime after Jan. 27 — after then acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed White House Counsel Don McGahn about U.S. intercepts of Flynn’s calls.\n\nThe House and Senate intelligence committees and at least five other congressional panels have begun investigating Russia’s efforts to influence the outcome of the presidential election and reports of dealings between Trump campaign operatives and the Russians.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump’s Wild Press Conference\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee on Friday sent a formal request to the White House and more than a dozen organizations, agencies and individuals asking them to preserve all materials related to the panel’s investigation of Russia’s interference in the election and related issues, according to the Associated Press. The letters were sent the same day the committee members received a classified briefing from FBI Director James Comey at the Capitol.\n\nTrump said at his news conference on Friday that he was less concerned about Flynn’s conduct than the fact that information about his phone conversations and alleged ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia had been leaked to the news media. “I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,” he said. “Those are criminal leaks.”\n\nUnder questioning this morning by Fox News host Chris Wallace, Priebus said he wasn’t at liberty to identify the senior intelligence officials who shot down The Times story about frequent contacts between Trump’s camp and the Russians. \"When I say top-level people, I mean top-level people,\" Priebus said.\n\nLater, during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Priebus told Chuck Todd that Trump was justified in his outrage against The Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNN and other major news outlets that have published bombshell reports of questionable accuracy and detracted from the new President’s accomplishments.\n\nRelated: White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force\n\n“This is what we’re dealing with while we’re putting in a lobbying ban, while we’re freezing federal government employees, while we’re getting the economy back on track, we’re sitting here talking about these stories, or whether [White House senior adviser] Steve Bannon and I get along or not – which we do,” he said. “I can assure you, people in Kenosha, Wisconsin, aren’t worried about that. They want to see jobs and money back in their pockets.”\n\nAs for Trump’s vicious attacks on the news media and his over-the-top tweet that reporters are the “enemy” of the American people, Priebus sought to downplay an allegation that has shaken many journalists, politicians and other First Amendment champions.\n\n“Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, John Adams have all had their issues with the press,” Priebus said. “I can assure you of this, Chuck, and everyone in your business: The president believes in the First Amendment. He believes in the free press. I believe in those things. We don’t believe everyone is lousy in the media, we don’t believe that everything is bad.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Historically Low Approval Rating Proves One Thing – He’s Doing It His Way\n\n“But there are some things that are really bad, and he categorizes that as fake news,” he added. “What we have been through over the last ten days – the leaks, the fake stories, the anonymous accusations. That stuff is bad.”\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told ABC News’ This Week today that Trump’s attack on the press “is something you hear tin-pot dictators say when they want to control all of the information.”\n\nSchiff said that he was stunned by Trump’s comment, and characterized them as unprecedented in modern presidential politics. “Not even Nixon went there,” he said."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/19/How-John-McCain-Became-Face-GOP-Resistance-Trump",
    "text": "As President Trump’s administration rumbles toward the end of his first month in office, one of his most visible emerging critics is octogenarian Arizona Sen. John McCain. The recently re-elected national defense hawk has by no means joined the burgeoning #Resist movement -- he has voted for all but one of Trump’s cabinet nominees -- but more than most of his GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill, he has been willing to stand up and push back against the new administration in a very public way.\n\nMcCain stepped in as the champion of the news media on Saturday, in the face of Trump’s increasingly strident attacks on the free press, which he characterized as “the enemy of the American people” in a tweet Friday afternoon.\n\nRelated: Does Anyone Still Want to Work for the Trump Administration?\n\n“I hate the press. I hate you, especially,” McCain said jokingly in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC’s Meet the Press. “But the fact is, we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It's vital.”\n\nHe continued, “If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and, many times, adversarial press,” McCain added. “And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That's how dictators get started.”\n\n“When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I'm not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I'm just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.”\n\nMcCain also went after Trump, albeit indirectly, at a high-level summit on global security in Munich last week. In remarks to attendees, McCain systematically repudiated the president’s nationalist rhetoric and his repeated insistence that the US should be less engaged in international affairs.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump’s Wild Press Conference\n\nThe Munich conference, an annual event that draws senior leaders from around the world, was founded as a means of promoting peace and stability. Those founders, McCain said, “would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism.”\n\n“They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see towards immigrants and refugees and minority groups -- especially Muslims. They would be alarmed by the growing inability -- and even unwillingness -- to separate truth from lies. They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent.”\n\n“But what would alarm them most, I think, is a sense that many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West ... that they see it as a bad deal that we may be better off without ... and that while Western nations still have the power to maintain our world order, it is unclear whether we have the will.”\n\nHe promised the attendees, again without specifically mentioning Trump, that senior figures in the administration and in Congress do not share the belief that the US can safely shed its leadership role in global affairs.\n\nRelated: White House Denies Plan to Use Guard Troops as Deportation Force\n\nMcCain’s rise as a symbol of Republican resistance to some elements of the Trump agenda is the result of a combination of factors. He has not been the most consistent or even the strongest critic of the administration within his party. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were strong critics of Trump during the presidential campaign, at a time when McCain was playing the role of a loyal supporter while enduring Trump’s insults in an effort to assure his own re-election.\n\nBut McCain has a combination of things that make him stand out. The first is his visibility. As a former Republican presidential nominee, he has extraordinary name recognition with the public. He also has close relationships with many in the media, his claim of “hating” the press notwithstanding, and tends to get lots of generally favorable coverage. See, for example, this cover story in New York Magazine.\n\nThe second, and perhaps most significant, is that he has the ability to get under Trump’s skin. This is most likely a side effect of his visibility. Trump is known to be a voracious consumer of cable news, and can hardly have avoided seeing McCain’s critical comments about him. The president’s personal Twitter feed overflows with negative comments about McCain, often in reaction to the senator’s public statements.\n\nLast week, when McCain criticized a US military raid in Yemen that went badly and resulted in the death of an American special operator, Trump responded furiously on Twitter, accusing him of emboldening the enemy. His White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, also criticized McCain’s comments, questioning his understanding of military operations (McCain is a Navy veteran and serves as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee) and suggesting that he was somehow dishonoring the fallen warrior.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Historically Low Approval Rating Proves One Thing – He’s Doing It His Way\n\nMcCain’s response was cutting.\n\nJohn McCain vs. Sean Spicer. Watch. pic.twitter.com/pEjg8H4Frc — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 9, 2017\n\nThis is, in all likelihood, a self-reinforcing cycle. Trump’s focus on McCain’s criticisms assures that they will get more air time, which will further anger Trump, leading to even stronger responses, and so on. The result is that, whether or not he really is Trump’s harshest critic in the Republican Party, McCain is becoming the de facto face of GOP resistance."

    "text": "The federal government’s track record of cleaning up environmental hazards including nuclear waste sites has been spotty, at best, over the past two decades, even as the cleanup cost to taxpayers has soared, according to a new Government Accountability Office report.\n\nFor decades, the federal government has been responsible for cleaning up military installations and other areas where federal nuclear power and weapons production have contaminated the environment. Last year, the government’s liabilities for cleaning up contaminated sites totaled $447 billion, according to Treasury Department figures, or more than double the $212 billion estimated price tag in 1997. But that latest estimate doesn’t begin to reflect all of the future cleanup responsibilities federal agencies may be facing, according to the GAO report, meaning that the ultimate cost could be billions higher.\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog Tells Trump Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nMany of the contaminated sites are byproducts of the Cold War era, when the government dramatically stepped up its development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. Throughout the Cold War, the federal government enlisted hundreds of factories and research centers in Tennessee, New Mexico, Kentucky, Maine and elsewhere to help develop nuclear weapons and other forms of atomic energy. Many of those sites were subsequently contaminated by residual radioactive contamination requiring government cleanups.\n\nThe Department of Energy and the Defense Department have had primary responsibility for overseeing those cleanup operations and monitoring the growing cost, but the GAO says those agencies and others have fallen short of their goals.\n\nSince 1994, the GAO has issued at least 28 recommendations to improve cost estimates and strengthen risk-based management of cleanup work, but just 13 of them have been implemented by the Departments of Defense, Energy and Agriculture. Last week, the GAO added those departments’ environmental cleanup operations to its “High Risk List” of government operations in need of reform or improvement.\n\nRelated: America’s Nukes Are Getting Old – and Cost $40 Billion a Year to Maintain\n\n“Because of the lack of complete information and the often inconsistent approach to making cleanup decisions, federal agencies cannot always address their environmental liabilities in ways that maximize the reduction of health and safety risks to the public and the environment in a cost effective manner,” the GAO said in its report.\n\nGAO’s High Risk List is updated every two years and is designed to focus public attention on governmental problem areas. With the addition of environmental cleanup and two other activities, the 2017 list highlights 34 government activities that are vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement."

    "text": "In what might be the opening salvo in the coming budget wars this year, the Trump Administration’s Office of Management and Budget has targeted a group of long-standing programs with strong Democratic support for deep cuts or elimination.\n\nThe list of the nine government programs in President Trump’s crosshairs, first reported on Saturday by The New York Times, includes many familiar GOP targets that have managed to survive for decades, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps and the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities.\n\nRelated: Five Big Challenges Facing Trump’s New Budget Chief\n\nRepublican efforts to do in Big Bird and public television, slash funding for the arts and sciences and undermine overseas economic development programs are evergreens that date back to the Republican Revolution of the 1990s spearheaded by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.\n\nMounting attacks on these and other programs have always proved to be good political theater for the GOP, even though the amounts of money at stake were relatively meager and the Democrats time and again blunted the attacks as part of the give and take of the appropriations process. What’s more, the amounts at stake represented a minuscule fraction of the nearly $4 trillion annual federal budget.\n\nAs The Times noted, the targeted programs – which also include the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Appalachian Regional Commission – each one costs under $500 million a year -- or a total of about $2.5 billion annually.\n\nWhile that total is nothing to sneeze at, it amounts to small change compared to the trillions of dollars that Trump and the congressional Republicans intend to spend this year on corporate and individual tax cuts, a major military and missile defense buildup, new infrastructure and an assortment of other campaign promises.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nMoreover, the Republican-controlled Congress is in the throes of an historic debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act and the nation’s health care system. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other House and Senate GOP leaders are contemplating dramatic changes in Medicaid and Medicare, the health care programs for the poor and elderly and two of the biggest drivers of the country’s long-term debt.\n\nTrump and his new OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, will have a chance this spring to weigh in on a package of spending bills for the current fiscal year that must be completed to avoid a government shutdown. Trump repeatedly promised during the campaign to attack government “waste, fraud and abuse,” and we are likely to see him cite programs on his hit list as prime examples of that waste.\n\nBut by targeting these programs, Trump may well be trying to distract the public’s attention away from the Republicans’ far more important “deficit-be-damned” fiscal and budget policies that some experts project will add at least $7 trillion to the debt over the coming decade.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nAs Steve Bell, a former Republican Senate Budget Committee staff director, told the Times, the nine targeted programs have little if no real impact on the government’s overall financial picture.\n\n“It’s sad in a way because these programs aren’t causing the deficit,” said Bell, who is now an official with the Bipartisan Policy Center. “These programs don’t amount to a hill of beans.”"

    "text": "In remarks at a Boeing event in South Carolina Friday, President Trump dangled the possibility that the Pentagon might be in the market for more F-18 Super Hornets, the multirole fighter that has been the backbone of naval combat aviation for years.\n\n“We are seriously looking at a big order [of F-18s],” he told the crowd at a Boeing plant in Charleston that had gathered for the rollout of the 787-10 Dreamliner, a larger version of the company’s latest passenger jet.\n\nIn the past, Trump has suggested that the F-18 might be a less expensive alternative to Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which currently costs about $95 million apiece and up, depending on the version.\n\nRelated: Is the F-35 Really Streaking by Its Troubled Past?\n\nBut it was unclear if the Negotiator-in-Chief was serious or just putting more pressure on Lockheed Martin, which he has already jawboned at least twice to bring down the cost of the F-35, the most expensive fighter in history.\n\nAt about $60 million a plane, the F-18 is considerably cheaper than the F-35, although the next version, the Advanced Super Hornet, might jack up the price tag considerably. And as F-35s are produced in more volume, the cost is dropping.\n\nThere are major differences between the two aircrafts besides price, the biggest being stealth. An F-35 is built to evade radar; an F-18 is not, at least not the current versions.\n\nPopular Science has written that suggesting that an F-18 can do the same job as an F-35 is “like suggesting a cruise ship can do the job of an aircraft carrier.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/17/Senate-Just-Confirmed-EPA-s-Arch-Enemy-Run-Agency",
    "text": "Scott Pruitt, the conservative Oklahoma attorney general who made a career of suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) largely on behalf of the oil and gas industry, narrowly won Senate confirmation on Friday to head the very agency he has long attempted to bring to its knees in battles over clean air and global warming issues.\n\nBy voting 52 to 46 along mostly party lines, the Republican-controlled Senate narrowly approved President Trump’s choice of Pruitt as the new EPA director in what environmental leaders view as a cruel joke. At a time when global leaders fear that it may soon be too late to do anything to reverse climate change, Trump is bringing in a wily lawyer who shares in his skepticism of global warming science with marching orders to begin to dismantle the agency.\n\nRelated: A Climate Change Doubter Will Overhaul the EPA in Trump’s Administration\n\n“There has never been a nominee for EPA administrator opposed so strongly by environmental and public health advocates, scientists, and hundreds of current and former EPA officials,” said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization. “For the first time in the history of the EPA, Senate Republicans have installed one of the agency’s most strident opponents to run it – someone who has fought tooth-and-nail against the agency’s public health and environmental safeguards.”\n\nPruitt, 48, is a former state senator and unsuccessful candidate for Oklahoma lieutenant governor. As state attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA at least 14 times – frequently in coordination with major fossil fuel companies. He is widely viewed as the chief architect of the assault against former President Barack Obama’s climate change policies that were aimed at sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s aging power plants and manufacturing plants.\n\nPruitt also shares in Trump’s conviction that the federal government has overstepped its bounds in pressing for ever-tougher air standards that add billions of dollars to the operating costs of industry. He has frequently argued that much of the EPA’s clean air regulatory authority should be shifted to the states.\n\nNow the fox has been put in charge of the hen house, triggering major protests not only by environmental groups and Democrats but by scores of career government workers at the EPA throughout the country who called their senators in an effort to block Pruitt’s confirmation, as The New York Times reported yesterday.\n\nThe Climate Change Crisis Trump Refuses to Acknowledge\n\nTypically, career employees maintain a low profile during the transfer of power to a new administration, with the understanding that policy changes are inevitable and that they must roll with the punches. But the outpouring of opposition to Pruitt from EPA scientists, lawyers and others in the agency is extraordinary, according to the Times, and signals that civil war could break out if Pruitt seeks to dismantle the core mission of the EPA.\n\nChristine Todd Whitman, the former Republican New Jersey governor and EPA commissioner under President George W. Bush, told the newspaper that “What it means is that it’s going to be a bloodbath when Pruitt gets in there.”\n\nEnvironmentalists have long complained about Pruitt’s close ties with the oil and gas industry. He has received more than $300,000 from oil and gas companies during his campaigns over the years, according to The Washington Post. He also headed the Republican Attorneys General Association, which garnered generous contributions from Koch Industries, ExxonMobil and other companies.\n\nEven as Senate Republicans moved towards confirming Pruitt over the strong objections of environmental groups and Democrats, an Oklahoma judge on Thursday ordered Pruitt to hand over thousands of emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. The Center for Media and Democracy has for the past two years sought those emails in attempting to document the link between Pruitt and the oil and gas industry.\n\nRelated: Obama--This May Be ‘The Last Generation’ That Can Stop Climate Change\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and other Democrats urged the GOP leadership to delay a final vote on confirmation until after a one-week recess in order to see what emerges from the emails. But Senate Republicans rejected what they viewed as another stalling tactic by the Democrats and pressed ahead to confirm Pruitt’s nomination.\n\n“Attorney General Pruitt has been more thoroughly vetted than any nominee for EPA administrator,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, in a statement. “It is time to confirm him.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/17/1-Trillion-Border-Tax-Could-Sink-Paul-Ryan-s-Fiscal-Plan",
    "text": "For House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), slashing tax rates is second in importance only to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA House GOP “Better Way” plan unveiled by Ryan last year would reduce the number of individual tax rates from seven to three at substantially lower levels, nearly double the standard deductions while closing many loopholes, slash investment income taxes and lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Finance Health Care Plan\n\nBut the centerpiece of Ryan’s tax plan – and what sets it apart from President Trump’s approach -- is a “border adjustment” tax the speaker wants to slap on all imported goods, including materials used in U.S. manufacturing, while exempting all exported goods.\n\nThe controversial measure has seriously split the business community and its allies on Capitol Hill. Proponents see it as a major incentive for more domestic investment and expansion, while opponents warn that it would drive up retailers’ import costs and force them to raise prices for consumers.\n\nThe plan has drawn fire from car dealers, toy manufacturers, oil refiners and others. And on Thursday, Americans for Prosperity, a libertarian group founded by the Koch Brothers, formally launched a campaign to defeat the measure targeted at members of the House and Senate tax writing committees, who will be wrestling with the issue later this year.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), the number two Republican in the Senate, may have delivered the crowning blow by telling reporters that the border tax idea “is on life support” and that he didn’t see GOP votes in the Senate lining up behind it.\n\nRelated: Dueling Trump and GOP Tax Plans Would Cause Much Larger Deficits\n\n“The hard reality is the border tax is on life support, and given the imperative of 51 senators and 218 House members and one president, I think we need to look for other options,” Cornyn said. Trump has said he would unveil a tax plan of his own within several weeks, but has yet to take an official position on the border adjustment tax.\n\nWithout the border adjustment tax provision, Ryan’s overall tax cut for individuals and businesses would collapse. That’s because it is estimated to raise more than $1 trillion over the coming decade, which is the amount that will be needed to offset the massive tax cuts and take down the current corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRyan, a former chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and an ardent proponent of the first major rewriting of the federal tax code since 1986, delivered a ringing defense of the border adjustment tax and his overall tax reform proposals during a news conference on Thursday.\n\n“This is existential to our economy, and we know this,” Ryan said. “And so we’re going to get tax reform done and there’s going to be a whole bunch of drama.”\n\nBut the border adjustment idea is proving to be a tough sell. And even Trump, who is eager to push through a major tax cut this year to make good on one of his most important campaign promises, has said that Ryan’s plan may be “too complicated” to sell to Congress and the public.\n\nAccording to a Tax Foundation analysis, the border adjustment would “eliminate the ability for companies to deduct the cost of imports,” while at the same time eliminating the tax on income attributable to exports.\n\nRelated: Ryan Declares GOP Has a ‘Mandate’ to Enact Sweeping Changes\n\n“This would shift the current corporate income tax from an origin-based tax—one that applies to the production of goods and services in the United States—to a destination-based tax—one that applies to the consumption of goods and services in the United State,” according to the analysis.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal recently noted, the border adjustment tax would also transform the business tax system “so that companies selling goods and services in the U.S. largely couldn’t escape taxes by putting their addresses, intellectual property or jobs outside America in low-tax countries.”\n\nScott Hodge, president of the conservative leaning Tax Foundation, said in an interview Friday that it is far too soon to write off the border adjustment tax idea, but that without it, Ryan and other House GOP leaders would have a hard time coming up with an alternative.\n\n“It’s a very key element of the plan … and because it’s new, it’s going to naturally be the focus of a lot of attention,” Hodge said.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s either dead or even on life support,” he added. “This is the natural process of things with major tax reform.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/17/White-House-Denies-Plan-Use-Guard-Troops-Deportation-Force",
    "text": "The White House on Friday morning tried to shoot down a report that the Trump administration had drafted a plan to use National Guard troops to arrest undocumented immigrants. The report, which the Associated Press published shortly after 10 a.m., is based on an 11-page draft proposal that has been circulating within the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHowever, some elements of the story first posted by the AP do not appear to be backed up by the document. Specifically, the news agency suggested that the number of troops involved could reach 100,000, a figure that appears nowhere in the draft memo.\n\n“This is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tweeted not long after the story broke.\n\nRelated: Does Anyone Still Want to Work for the Trump Administration?\n\nSpicer also addressed the report on Air Force One, as the president traveled to his vacation home in Florida for the third weekend in a row. “There is no effort at all to utilize the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants,” he said\n\nIt was unclear just how much the White House was pushing back against the story. The claim that there is no current effort to use the National Guard to enforce immigration law is not the same thing as denying that such a plan was or is in the works. And Spicer’s categorical claim that the story was “100%” false seems to suggest Spicer is challenging even the provenance of the memo.\n\nHowever, other reporters from different outlets who cover DHS said that the idea of using the National Guard in this capacity has been under discussion for weeks. It was not immediately clear who leaked the memo to the AP, or for what purpose.\n\nSupporters of the Trump administration also took issue with the AP’s framing of the story. The headline on the original piece posted on the service’s website, “Trump weighs mobilizing Nat Guard for immigration roundups,” suggests that the proposal had made its way to the president’s desk. In fact, it is at least possible that the plan was never discussed beyond the staff level at DHS.\n\nSpicer blasted the AP for releasing the story without comment from the administration, but the original version of the news service’s story noted that both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security had failed to even respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe memo does suggest that members of the National Guard could be effectively deputized under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the DHS director to authorize “qualified officers or employees” of a state to act in the capacity of federal immigration officers.\n\n“Pursuant to Title 32 of the United States Code, State National Guard components are employees of their respective states and are under the command of their governors when they are not in federal service. Based on their training and experience, these men and women are particularly well-suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by [DHS] components.”\n\nIt further directs immigration officials to immediately invite “governors of the states adjacent to the land border with Mexico and those states adjoining such border states” to add their National Guard units to the 287(g) program.\n\nThe memo also appears to order the immediate detention of any person found crossing the border illegally until they can be deported or any claim to asylum can be adjudicated, something that would require a dramatic expansion of DHS detention facilities.\n\nThe new detention facilities would be located close to the border, the memo notes, ordering top officials to “take all necessary action and allocate all available resources to expand their detention capabilities and capacities at or near the border with Mexico to the greatest extent practicable.\n\nThe AP reported that the memo appeared to come from John Kelly, the retired Marine Corps general who President Trump appointed to run DHS. However, it is not uncommon for draft memos to carry the name of the official who would ultimately have to approve them before that approval is actually given.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump’s Wild Press Conference\n\nA national security expert who looked at the AP story said that the proposal seems to bear the hallmarks of an early-stage draft, perhaps from more junior staff.\n\n“It appears to be another one of those cases where somebody had an idea, and drafted up a memo about it, maybe without a lot of knowledge about how government actually works,” said Heather Hurlburt, the former head of the National Security Network, now with the New America Foundation. “It’s not something that DHS can just do on its own. There are sort of obvious historical reasons why the guard forces belong more to the states than they do to the feds.”\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\nRegardless of how far up the chain of command the idea of using a National Guard deployment went in the administration, the report had more than a ring of truth given Trump’s promises during the presidential campaign. He vowed to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants within two years and said that there would be a “deportation force” mobilized for that purpose. The Border Patrol estimates that between 2013 and 2015, 2.1 million people crossed into the United States illegally over the southern border.\n\nMany commentators concerned about the draft proposals immediately warned that it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that bars federal troops from being used as law enforcement personnel inside the United States. However, that law does not apply to state National Guard units operating under the control of their states’ governors within the territory of their own state or nearby states at the invitation of their governors.\n\nThe proposal, according to the AP, specifically says that state governors would have the discretion to mobilize and that the troops would remain under state control.\n\nIn fact, National Guard troops have been used in a law enforcement capacity in the wake of some natural disasters. They have also been deployed repeatedly in recent years to assist law enforcement agencies operating on the border.\n\nRelated: Why Can’t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nHurlburt pointed out that there are legitimate worries about the wisdom of giving National Guard troops the authority to enforce immigration law.\n\n“There’s a reason law enforcement personnel are highly trained and don’t just walk into the job and start arresting people,” she said. “Imagine deputizing ... people who are trained to do different things? It’s not coincidental that some of the worst abuses of the Iraq war were committed by National Guard troops that were put in positions that they were in no way trained or prepared for.”"

Typically, a new president enters the Oval Office with high approval ratings since most Americans want him to succeed. Assuming he doesn’t make too many blunders, the president gets the benefit of the doubt and is given time to set the ship right.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump’s Wild Press Conference\n\nTrump’s mistakes, however, are piling up almost as quickly as his executive orders, and people are beginning to understand that Trump’s behavior in the White House is the same we had on the campaign trail -- tweet for tweet, rant for rant, exaggeration for exaggeration.\n\nGallup isn’t the only litmus test of the new president’s performance.

    "text": "Former Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), who was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as the new White House budget director, has the unenviable task of trying to reconcile his career as a fiery deficit hawk with President Trump’s unrestrained calls for new spending and tax cuts.\n\nTrump has promised an historic buildup of the military and nuclear arsenal, construction of a wall along the southern border, a $1 trillion infrastructure program, safeguarding of Social Security and Medicare, and tax cuts for businesses and individuals that could add at least $7 trillion to the long-term debt. The president has said that a strong military is “more important” than a balanced budget.\n\nRelated: Republicans Eye Medicaid Cuts to Help Finance Their New Health Plan\n\nBy contrast, Mulvaney, the one-time Tea Party champion, has been an ardent foe of defense spending and has repeatedly called for major savings in entitlement programs, including Social Security. The South Carolina Republican preferred a government shutdown to voting to raise the debt ceiling, and he only favors major tax cuts if they are offset by budget cuts or other savings.\n\nPressed during his Senate confirmation hearing last month to explain how he intends to advocate for Trump’s fiscal policies while preserving his principles and integrity, the 49-year-old Mulvaney replied, “My job is to be completely and brutally honest with him.”\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget is the nexus of any administration’s spending and tax revenue policy making, and it has enormous influence over the operations of the federal bureaucracy and regulatory review.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\n“First of all, he’s either going to be the most influential member of the cabinet or the next one out the door,” said Stan Collender, a Washington budget expert and blogger. “A lot of what Trump wants to do and the House and Senate Republicans want to do on taxes and spending are things he has fought against.”\n\nAs he hits the ground running this week after barely winning Senate confirmation by a margin of 51 to 49, here are five of Mulvaney’s biggest challenges as Trump’s new budget chief:\n\nDefense – Mulvaney has long complained about wasteful defense spending, but he better get over it. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was the only Republican to vote against Mulvaney’s nomination yesterday. McCain declared that it would be “irresponsible to place the future of the defense budget” in Mulvaney’s hands.\n\nSince winning the election, Trump has promised a major build-up of all branches of the military and a “state of the art” missile defense system. Trump and many Republican leaders are eager to lift a spending cap on defense by $30 billion to $40 billion. Mulvaney has reluctantly indicated he will play ball with Trump and McCain to boost defense spending but only so long as it’s offset with cuts across the federal budget, according to Politico.\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nEntitlement Spending – Trump campaigned on a pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts – a promise that is regularly highlighted in a TV ad sponsored by the AARP, the nation’s premier advocate for seniors. But during his confirmation hearings, Mulvaney said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70 and reiterated his commitment to achieving other savings in Medicare.\n\nThere’s no telling how this year’s looming battle over health care policy –- including the Republicans effort to repeal and replace Obamacare –- will play out. Yet House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other conservative policy makers continue to harbor an intense interest in tossing Social Security and Medicare into the mix.\n\nThe Budget – Newly elected presidents rarely submit a formal budget to Congress during their first few months in office, but Trump and Mulvaney will have to face some thorny spending issues for the current fiscal year that were left over by the last Congress.\n\nIn a move to simplify the post-election legislative session and placate conservative Republicans unwilling to take a chance on former President Barack Obama extracting some last-minute domestic spending concessions, Ryan announced last December a stopgap fiscal 2017 spending bill that would keep the government operating at roughly last year’s levels through March 31.\n\nThat has given Trump and his advisers time to weigh in on unresolved spending issues, including finding more money for defense and cutting more deeply into domestic programs backed by Democrats, including Planned Parenthood.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare’s Individual Mandate Optional\n\nDebt Ceiling – With the national debt currently at $19.97 trillion and rising, Trump and GOP leaders will soon find themselves stuck with the thankless task of raising the legal debt ceiling for borrowing by the Treasury. The party in power must always assume responsibility for raising the debt ceiling, giving the minority the opportunity to blame the majority for profligate spending. The Treasury will officially begin to bump up against its borrowing limits March 16, leaving the administration with only a few months to act before facing a fiscal crisis and a possible government shutdown.\n\nAs a freshman member of Congress, Mulvaney challenged the need to raise the debt ceiling and even now suggests that the federal government should consider prioritizing Treasury payments, rather than paying all its debts. But that cavalier attitude could get Mulvaney into trouble. And the new Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, declared recently that “there should be no uncertainty that we are paying the bills.\n\nObamacare Repeal and Tax Cuts – Passing just one budget resolution in a year can be a heavy lift for the party in power; passing two in the same calendar year may be unprecedented. Yet congressional Republican leaders and the new Trump administration are counting on adoption of fiscal 2017 and 2018 resolutions under fast-track rules as the vehicles for dismantling Obamacare and passing major tax cut legislation.\n\nBoth of these resolutions are highly complex documents that will invariably be laden with highly controversial health and tax policies requiring careful review by the OMB, as well as the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and key White House advisers. If Mulvaney and Trump have a falling out over health care and entitlement policy, this is where the sparks could really fly."

    "text": "President Trump’s choice to replace his fired National Security Adviser has declined the job, citing family and financial obligations that he said would be difficult for him to meet if he assumed the 24/7 responsibilities that go with managing the White House’s Situation Room.\n\nPrivately, though, retired Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward is said to have demurred because of the evident chaos in the White House, notwithstanding Trump’s insistence in a rambling press conference on Thursday that it is running like a “fine-tuned machine.” Speaking to friends, the former Navy SEAL with 40-years of service called the offer a “shit sandwich,” after learning, among other things, that he would not be allowed to appoint his own staff and would have to accept former NSA staffer and Fox News contributor, K. T. McFarland as his deputy.\n\nRelated: 6 Remarkable Moments From Trump’s Wild Press Conference\n\nIt seems fair to ask whether Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would have said yes to his nomination if he had known in advance that he, too, wouldn’t be allowed his choice of a second-in-command. Former State Department official Elliott Abrams was denied the post of deputy secretary of state, reportedly after Trump learned that Abrams had been critical of him during the election.\n\nYou get the sense that this is going to keep happening: That well-qualified candidates for hugely important positions in the executive branch, like Harward, are going to look at offers from Trump’s team and take a hard pass. In fact, it’s an open question as to whether or not it has already been happening, just behind the scenes.\n\nThe Trump administration has more than 1,200 Senate-confirmed positions that it needs to fill. The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service have teamed up to track the nominations of the 696 “key” executive branch positions. It has now been exactly 100 days since Trump woke up on November 9 as the president-elect and his team has publicly announced nominations for just 44 of them. (The job Harward turned down wasn’t even subject to the Senate confirmation process, though given his history there is little doubt he would have been speedily confirmed.)\n\nThe White House has been very obviously unable to fill the key job of communications director, leaving embattled Press Secretary Sean Spicer to try to juggle those responsibilities as well as his own.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\nSome people saw this coming. Barely a week after the election, Eliot A. Cohen, who served in the George W. Bush administration as a counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice from 2007 to 2009, was waving off conservatives considering a job with the Trump administration.\n\nHe had originally encouraged people to try to serve, but to keep a pre-written resignation letter in their desks. However, after contacts with the transition team in the days after the election, he revised his opinion.\n\n“The President-elect is surrounding himself with mediocrities whose chief qualification seems to be unquestioning loyalty.... By all accounts, his ignorance, and that of his entourage, about the executive branch is fathomless,” he wrote in a scathing Post op-ed.\n\n“Conservative political types should not volunteer to serve in this administration, at least for now,” he continued. “They would probably have to make excuses for things that are inexcusable and defend people who are indefensible.”\n\nRelated: Why Can’t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nIn the meanwhile, he urged, “Do what you can do in other venues, and remember that this too will pass, and someday a more normal kind of administration will either emerge or replace this one. Your country still needs you — just not yet.”\n\nIt’s beginning to look as though more than a few people are taking Cohen’s advice."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/17/North-Korea-s-Missile-Test-Leaves-Trump-Three-Options",
    "text": "You have to hand it to Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s unpredictable president: Launching a new ballistic missile just as President Trump and Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe were meeting in Washington couldn’t have been more provocative.\n\nFactor in the assassination of Kim’s estranged half-brother a few days later and you have to figure this is a busy young man with a tight schedule.\n\nThe North tested more than a warhead-bearing technology last Sunday. It also tested the incoming administration’s resolve, and with good reason. For the first time in nearly a decade, there’s serious talk of new negotiations to resolve what is now a crisis over Pyongyang’s nuclear program.\n\nRelated: The Missile North Korea Just Tested Will be Difficult for the US to Stop\n\nThere is no debate on this point: The North’s tests contravene a Security Council resolution barring the development of ballistic missiles and the weaponization of what nuclear capabilities it may have. The Chinese, the Russians, the South Koreans, the Security Council itself—everyone condemned this latest act of bold assertion. In Washington, Trump and Abe stood shoulder to shoulder.\n\nAbe said, “North Korea’s most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,” while\n\nTrump replied, “I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.”\n\n“Intolerable” is a pretty big word and raises a big question: If the North’s nuclear advances are unacceptable, what’s the rest of the world going to do about them?\n\nThat’s Trump’s question more than anyone else’s. As the Chinese just reminded the U.S. for the umpteenth time, a solution to the North Korea question lies in talks involving Washington and Pyongyang.\n\nAs Barack Obama’s second term drew to a close, the outgoing president warned his successor—then widely assumed to be Hillary Clinton—that the Korean peninsula would be the most pressing foreign policy problem on the Oval Office desk. At the time, campaign officials indicated that Clinton vigorously agreed that this was the priority issue.\n\nRelated: U.S. Demands International Action on North Korea Tests\n\nNow Trump inherits precisely the same three policy options Clinton had in her dossiers:\n\nChina gets an ultimatum: Force Pyongyang to curtail its nuclear program or the U.S. will prepare for one or another kind of military intervention. There was an influential constituency behind this option at the time of Trump’s election, Washington sources said then; during his visit to Seoul earlier this month, Defense Secretary Mattis signaled that it’s still in place.\n\n\n\nDo nothing. In other words, the status quo—persistent tensions, occasional provocations from the North—reigns. Last week’s test, U.S. analysts said, marked a minor advance from previously tested intermediate-range missiles and didn’t pose a threat to North America.\n\n\n\nReopen negotiations. While the Obama administration dismissed the thought, preferring to strengthen sanctions, there is a decades-long history of talks with Pyongyang. On his first visit to Beijing as Obama’s secretary of state in 2013, John Kerry sought China’s help to bring the North back to the negotiating table.\n\nRelated: Trump Administration to Weigh Options, Press China on North Korea Missile Test\n\nA military solution, a diplomatic solution, no solution: That’s about it. There are problems with all three of these alternatives, but one has fewer than the other two.\n\nUnless China brings the North Koreans around, forceful intervention overestimates Beijing’s leverage in Pyongyang and its willingness to exert what influence it has. China has seen the North as a useful if troublesome buffer since the Korean War. Most important, military analysts say the North could destroy a quarter to a third of Seoul within a matter of minutes after it is attacked. This risk alone takes the military option more or less off the table.\n\nDoing nothing just got a lot less tenable. Last Sunday’s test sent a missile 310 miles into the Sea of Japan. That’s slightly less than half the distance between the North and the Japanese coast, but Kim’s signal is clear: We’re upping the ante, and there’s more where this came from.\n\nThat leaves negotiation. With a record of failures in view, let’s call it the least unpromising alternative.\n\nTalks with the North on its nuclear program go back to the mid-1990s when President Clinton signed an “Agreed Framework” to bring Pyongyang back into the International Atomic Energy Agency. When that accord fell apart in 2002, six countries met regularly -- South Korea, Japan, Russia, and China -- until 2009.\n\nRelated: U.S. Will Strengthen Pacific Allies Against North Korea Hostility\n\nIt is time to try again, for two reasons:\n\nMany Asians—including Japan’s premier—mark down Obama’s sanctions against North Korea as a failure, and they would be correct. Sanctions hurt, but they don’t get other nations to do things much differently. See Russia. See Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn last week’s test upside down, and it could be a positive signal. Kim looks at the Iran nuclear accord, and then at Trump’s inclination to negotiate a better relationship with Russia, and wonders if he has a chance to make a deal with the artful dealmaker. Note in this connection: Kim may have eliminated a dynastic rival if he had his half-brother assassinated this week, but the president who craves acceptance also furthered his reputation as an international pariah.\n\nJapan, China, and South Korea’s main opposition party, the Democrats, are now on the record favoring a new round of talks. So are many influential China experts and former officials in the U.S. For his part, Trump appears to leave the door open. Look again at his statement while he stood at the podium with Abe: He didn’t mention the missile test. And it was after his talks with Trump that Abe suggested to parliamentarians back home, Let’s try something new.\n\nIf talks materialize, there’s a clear advantage for returning to the six-party format. China and Russia are powerful influences, given the Kim dynasty’s long shared ideological history with Beijing and Moscow.\n\nThere’s a big advantage for Trump, too: Even beginning a negotiation process would help repair the president’s stony start in his relations with Beijing. Trump seems to know this."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/16/6-Remarkable-Moments-Trump-s-Wild-Press-Conference",
    "text": "In a long, rambling press conference early Thursday afternoon, President Trump dismissed a number of the controversies swirling around his presidency as “fake news,” insisted that his White House is running like a “finely-tuned machine,” and issued a tepid denial that any of his campaign aides were in contact with the Russian government prior to his election.\n\nThe overriding theme of the 75-minute press conference was Trump’s various grievances with the media, but along the way he did make some news. He began by announcing that attorney Alexander Acosta, the dean of Florida International University Law School and a former member of the National Labor Relations Board, would be his replacement nominee for secretary of labor.\n\nRelated: Why Can’t Trump Get His Story Straight on Intelligence Leaks and Fake News?\n\nHe also said that next week his administration will release a new executive action on border security meant to accomplish some of the things that a previous order, currently stalled in litigation, was unable to do.\n\nHowever, much of the press conference was consumed not by policy discussion, but by Trump’s defense of his presidential campaign and of his administration’s actions in the first weeks of his term.\n\n“I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite,” he said at one point. “This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved.”\n\nTrump was pressed by three different reporters on whether or not anyone working for his campaign had contacts with Russian intelligence agents or other Russian officials. Multiple sources in the Intelligence Community have told news organizations that several of Trump’s associates had multiple contacts with Russia. After twice refusing to give a direct answer, he finally said, “Nobody that I know of.” He then wondered out loud, “How many times do I have to answer this question?”\n\nHere are a few more remarkable moments from the event:\n\n* On Obamacare: Trump seemed to suggest that members of Congress facing protests over the planned repeal of the Affordable Care Act represent only their Republican constituents. “We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.”\n\nRelated: Trump's Risky Message: He Doesn't Trust His Intelligence Chiefs\n\n* On the Electoral College: He repeated his false claim that his Electoral College margin in the November election was the largest since Ronald Reagan. When it was pointed out that what he had said was untrue, he said, “Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given — I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?”\n\n* On intelligence leaks: Trump has insisted that leaks about his campaign’s contact with the Russians are serious breaches of security, but that the news stories revealing the leaks are fake. Asked to clarify, he said, “You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.”\n\n* On Russia: Asked about recent Russian provocations, including the presence of a surveillance ship off the coast of Delaware, the apparent violation of a nuclear missile treaty and the buzzing of American ships by Russian warplanes, he blamed it all on the media. “I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.”\n\nHis rationale, apparently, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin is becoming increasingly aggressive because “He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.”\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Have Everything to Gain by Impeaching Trump\n\n* On anti-Semitism: Given two opportunities to specifically condemn the rise in anti-Semitic threats in the United States since his election, he avoided doing so both times. He suggested that much of it is attributable to his political opponents trying to make him look bad. At one point he berated a reporter for insinuating that he himself is an anti-Semite, despite the fact that the man prefaced his question by explicitly saying that he was suggesting no such thing.\n\n* On meeting the Congressional Black Caucus: When an African American reporter asked Trump if he would be working with the Congressional Black Caucus on his plan to revitalize troubled inner cities, Trump asked, “Are they friends of yours?” She replied, “I'm just a reporter.” Trump said, “Well, set up the meeting.”"

    "text": "Angry about leaks from the intelligence community, President Trump has asked a secretive private-equity billionaire to take a hard look at the multiple agencies that surreptitiously gather information in the name of protecting America, according to NBC News.\n\nHere is what you need to know about Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and one of Donald Trump’s campaign advisers.\n\n1. Feinberg is closely connected to controversial White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to The New York Times.\n\nRelated: Trump's Risky Message: He Doesn't Trust His Intelligence Chiefs\n\n2. He has no direct intelligence gathering or national security experience. However, Cerberus owns a private military contractor, DynCorp International, that provides security services to government agencies. In 2010, DynCorp had $3 billion in revenues, the majority of which came from the U.S. government.\n\n3. A Bronx-born Princeton grad who excelled at tennis and joined the ROTC, the 56-year-old Feinberg began his Wall Street career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which specialized in junk bonds and was driven into bankruptcy in 1990 after an insider-trading scandal that famously snared “junk bond king” Michael Milken. The prosecutor who went after Drexel was then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and eventual Trump campaign surrogate who was passed over for a cabinet position.\n\n4. Feinberg is a major Republican donor. In the 2016 race, he first donated $200,000 to the Jeb Bush presidential campaign. When Bush, battered by Trump, dropped out, Feinberg switched to his fellow billionaire. He donated almost $1.5 million to Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Trump, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nRelated: America Gets Its First Real Test of the CEO Presidency\n\n5. Cerberus, named after a mythological three-headed dog known as the “hound of Hell,” has more than $30 billion under management.\n\n6. The senior leadership of Cerberus includes former Vice-President Dan Quayle and former Treasury Secretary John Snow. So Feinberg is not only a big-time GOP donor, he also is connected to the Republican establishment.\n\n7. Feinberg has a reputation for avoiding the spotlight, and encourages his colleagues to do the same. He reportedly once said, \"If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it.\"\n\n8. Cerberus had major stakes in Chrysler and the financial arm of General Motors and was deeply involved in the government bailout of the auto industry under President Obama. Other Cerberus investments range from cosmetics (Avon) to fast-food (Strategic Restaurants) to pharma (PaxVax) and real estate (Haya).\n\n9. Not listed on the Cerberus website is its ownership of Freedom Group, a firearms holding company that controls such brands as Remington, Marlin and Bushmaster, maker of the AR-15 used by the Beltway snipers in 2002 and in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn.\n\n10. Feinberg has three daughters, is married to the former Gisela Sanchez has homes in Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn. He is said to be an avid elk hunter."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/16/Republicans-Eye-Medicaid-Cuts-Help-Finance-Their-New-Health-Plan",
    "text": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said on Thursday that House GOP leaders and strategists were closing in on a plan to repeal and partially replace the Affordable Care Act with a series of dramatic changes, including revamping and reducing the Medicaid program for low-income Americans, a refundable tax credit to help consumers cover premium costs, and other changes to encourage competition among insurers and bring down costs.\n\nRyan and other leaders met this morning with rank-and-file Republicans to outline the contours of an emerging plan for using a special expedited budget process called reconciliation to formally repeal Obamacare – effective at some future date --- and replacing portions of the law with the Republicans’ more market-oriented provisions. Tom Price, the new Health and Human Services Secretary, attended a portion of the session.\n\nRelated: Why Health Care Spending Could Rise Even Faster in the Next 10 Years\n\nAlthough Ryan offered only a few clues as to how House Republicans would rewrite the Obamacare legislation, media reports and some health care lobbyists say it will begin with the complete repeal of federal mandates requiring many businesses to provide health insurance to workers and requiring all uninsured Americans to purchase coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nThe measure would eliminate all of the Obamacare taxes on insurers, drug companies, medical device manufacturers and other businesses, as well as on upper-income people. Those taxes are projected to generate more than $1 trillion over the coming decade and were crucial to underwriting the cost of Obamacare’s insurance exchanges and subsidies for lower-income Americans.\n\nRepealing all those taxes is a major point of contention between House and Senate Republicans because many argue that the revenues will be needed to help finance the cost of the GOP replacement plan. However, Ryan, and Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) believe they can offset the lost revenues and pay for their initiative by capping the federal tax exclusion on large employer-based insurance plans and extracting huge savings from Medicaid.\n\nPremiums paid for employer-sponsored health insurance are excluded from taxable income, which reduces the amount workers owe as income and payroll taxes by roughly $250 billion annually. That is the largest tax break in the federal tax code and has long been eyed by both parties as a revenue source for other programs.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nThe emerging GOP plan – similar to one Ryan promoted last summer – offers a handful of incentives for consumers to purchase health insurance on their own. Those include tax-exempt health savings accounts to help cover medical costs and so-called refundable federal tax credits, paid in advance, that would go to most Americans, including people with low or no taxable income.\n\nCurrently, low-income people who qualify for premium subsidies under Obamacare must file for the credits on their federal tax returns – meaning that they don’t receive the subsidy until after they have purchased their health care plans.\n\n“They call them refundable tax credits, but they are subsidies, and they are subsidies that say ‘we will pay some people some money if you do what the government makes you do,’” Ryan said today. “That is not a tax credit, that is not freedom.”\n\nThe House GOP approach would preserve a number of features of the existing Obamacare law, including preventing insurers from discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical problems and allowing children to remain on their parents’ private health care plans until they turn 26. And it would experiment with federally financed, state-run “high-risk pools” that provide coverage to older and sicker Americans who would have trouble finding affordable health insurance in the private market.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare’s Individual Mandate Optional\n\nThe House proposal will undergo additional drafting during the upcoming Presidents’ Day recess, and Ryan and others are anxiously awaiting analysis of their proposals from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Those two agencies will be responsible for determining, among other things, whether the GOP approach would eliminate coverage for millions of Americans, as many critics predict, and whether it will add to the deficit.\n\nOne of the most controversial issues is how the Republicans will treat Medicaid as part of their overall effort to replace Obamacare. While Medicaid currently guarantees health care coverage for poor and disabled people, Ryan and others are promoting a plan to convert the half-century old entitlement to block grants to the states, placing a fixed cap on how much to spend and giving states more latitude to tighten eligibility requirements.\n\nThat move alone would save the government hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years while eliminating many of their coverage. The joint federal-state Medicaid program currently covers nearly 72 million Americans and spent approximately $545 billion during fiscal 2016, or $7,569 per person.\n\nRelated: The New Obamacare Rules Help Insurers But Not Consumers\n\nBut many Senate Republicans and some more moderate House Republicans oppose that approach to transforming Medicaid. Some are advancing an alternative approach that would base Medicaid funding on the number of people who qualify for it rather than on a fixed cap.\n\nRyan also hinted today that they are working out a plan that would allow the 31 states and the District of Columbia that opted for expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare to preserve the coverage at least temporarily. At the same time, the plan would provide additional health insurance funding to the 19 other states – mostly controlled by Republicans—that refused to take part in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nLawmakers from states that shunned the expanded Medicaid program argue that they are entitled to additional funding if the other states continue to receive the expanded Medicaid funding. Ryan told reporters today that he was looking for a compromise so that “we do it in a way that doesn’t disadvantage either side.”"

In 2014, after she was Executive Editor and then ex-Executive Editor, Abramson would tell Fox News that the Obama White House was one of the most secretive in history.\n\nObama also had some early fumbles.

It’s not as if the faithful would be turning on one of their own: Trump is a fake Republican. More important when it comes to the GOP’s hold on power, he could become a one-man wrecking crew.\n\nThe GOP would have to call in some major-league spin doctors to make the case that the party was putting the best interests of the country ahead of its own as it attempted to heal a divided nation by exiling the President to his gilded tower.\n\nBut get rid of Trump, and Republicans could get a pretty sweet return on their risky investment. Not just Pence, who will likely give them everything they might have gotten from Trump without the distaste and drama, but potentially Paul Ryan as Vice President and the prospect of not eight years of presidential power, but 16.\n\nThe trouble is, the longer Republicans wait, the more entrenched Trump will be, the more ferocious the opposition to his reign will become and the more likely the party will suffer down the road."

A few minutes later he followed up with, “The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!”\n\nLater Thursday morning, Trump was back online, writing “FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ‘sources,’ is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast! The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!” (The “306” was apparently a reference to the number of pledged electoral votes Trump won in the election. He actually received only 304 votes because two “faithless” electors refused to cast their ballots for him.)\n\nThe problem for Trump is that both of those things can’t be true at the same time. The leaks from the intelligence services indicate that during the election Trump’s team had extensive contact with Russian authorities, including intelligence agents. If that information is accurate -- and Trump’s fury over the revelation of what he characterizes as classified information surely suggests it may be -- then it is hard to reconcile with Trump’s simultaneous alternate narrative, in which the Russia story is the fruit of a Democratic plot with no basis in fact.\n\nUnfortunately, a lack of internal consistency isn’t limited to Trump’s tweets.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump doubled down on that line of analysis at a surprise press conference, saying that the claims about Russia were both leaks and fake news.\n\nRelated: Trump’s War with Intelligence Agencies Escalates Dangerously\n\nOn Wednesday, discussing the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the president lashed out at the media, blaming reporters for his departure from the administration.\n\n“Gen. Flynn is a wonderful man,” he said during a press conference. “I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases ... And I think it is really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.”\n\nBut that came less than 24 hours after Trump’s own spokesman, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, explicitly told reporters that Trump had demanded Flynn’s resignation because he no longer believed he could trust the retired Army general.\n\n“The president must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position,” Spicer said Tuesday. “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation in a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for Gen. Flynn’s resignation.”\n\nRelated: America Gets Its First Real Test of the CEO Presidency\n\nThe announcement of Flynn’s resignation on Monday night came after another set of contradictory statements from White House officials. On Monday afternoon, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview that Flynn still enjoyed the “full confidence” of President Trump. An hour later, Spicer took the podium in the Briefing Room and said that, in fact, the president was “evaluating the situation” with regard to Flynn. A few hours after that, the national security adviser was gone.\n\nThe next day, Conway posted a somewhat cryptic message on Twitter that read, “I serve at the pleasure of @POTUS. His message is my message. His goals are my goals. Uninformed chatter doesn't matter.”\n\nUnfortunately, in this administration, it’s become very difficult to tell who actually is informed."

    "text": "National health care spending will rise at an annual average rate of 5.6 percent of GDP over the coming decade, nearly four times the current rate of inflation, according to a new government study.\n\nAlthough the projected growth rate has slowed slightly from the previous year’s forecast, the analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) confirms that as more Baby Boomers retire and overall entitlement spending continues to grow, 19.9 percent of the overall economy will go for health care and prescription drugs by 2025. That compares to 17.8 percent of GDP currently.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nEconomic expansion, rising medical and drug costs and a rapidly aging population were all cited as factors contributing to rising health care costs, according to CMS data that was published Wednesday in the journal Health Affairs. Last year, the growth in health care costs slowed 1.1 percentage points to 4.8 percent, thanks in part to a lull in the growth of Medicaid and prescription drug spending. But that rate is expected to pick up again in the coming years.\n\nRising drug prices and episodes of blatant price gouging by pharmaceutical companies have drawn the attention of President Trump and some Republican and Democratic members of Congress, and are likely to inspire some sort of government action this year.\n\nHowever, the new CMS report says that increased competition among drug manufacturers could help to slow the rate of spending on prescription drugs, especially as patents expire on many name brand drugs and generic drug manufactures offer cheaper substitutes.\n\nIt’s important to note that the CMS forecasts are premised on the assumption that the current U.S. health care system remains in place. However, Trump and the Republican controlled Congress are pressing for action to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which would greatly alter the equation if they are successful. Obamacare has provided coverage for millions of previously uninsured Americans.\n\nThe insured percentage of the population is currently projected to increase from 90.9 percent in 2015 to 91.5 percent by 2025, assuming no change in current law.\n\nRelated: With Drug Prices Soaring, You May Not Get the Meds You Need\n\n“While there is currently significant debate involving potential future health-sector policy changes, the scope, timing, and impact of such possible changes on health spending and health insurance coverage are all uncertain at this time,” the CMS report stated."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/16/New-Obamacare-Rules-Help-Insurers-Not-Consumers",
    "text": "With the fate of the Republican drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act uncertain at best, the Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a new set of rules designed to “stabilize” the subsidized government insurance exchanges and stem the exodus of major insurers from the market.\n\nThe proposed new rules – among other things – would cut by half the three-month enrollment period currently scheduled for the 2018 insurance season, bringing it more in line with Medicare and private insurance enrollment periods. Insurance companies would be able to collect unpaid premium payments from consumers before issuing new policies.\n\nRelated: The IRS Has Just Made Obamacare’s Individual Mandate Optional\n\nPerhaps most importantly, HHS will lower the “de minimis range” used for determining the level of policy coverage ranging from the lowly bronze plan to the top-shelf gold level. With the exception of the silver plan – the most popular category in the program – the new rules would permit insurance companies to offer a lower plan that covers slightly fewer areas of health care and still be certified.\n\n“This proposal will take steps to stabilize the marketplace, provide more flexibility to states, and insurers, and give patients access to more coverage options,” Dr. Patrick Conway, Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), said in a statement. “They will help protect Americans enrolled in the individual and small group health insurance markets while future reforms are being debated.”\n\nThe proposed regulations immediately touched off a protest from Democrats and health care advocates who denounced them as another Trump administration salvo against the beleaguered health care system.\n\n“The proposed rule . . . is the latest attempt to sabotage the law and put insurance companies back in charge,” Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said in a statement. “Once implemented, the rule will reduce coverage, increase out-of-pocket costs, and make it harder for American families to get the health insurance they need.”\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nThe rules were unveiled by CMS just days after Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) was confirmed as the new secretary of health and human services. That suggests that Trump’s new health care chief will give Obamacare limited resources and attention while the Trump administration struggles to devise a replacement system they can sell to Congress.\n\nThe overarching theme of the proposed new CMS rules is to bolster insurers’ leverage in cutting financial losses while limiting consumer’s ability to game the system by exploiting extended enrollment periods and special sign-up exemptions. In some cases, consumers take advantage of those signup periods to drop in and out of health care coverage depending on their medical conditions.\n\nInsurers are looking for ways to attract and keep younger, healthier people who help to create a more balanced “risk pool” of younger and older patients in order to collect more in premiums and hold down their coverage costs.\n\nThe release of the proposed rule changes coincides with health care giant Humana’s announcement on Tuesday that it will drop out of the Obamacare system in 2018 after incurring major losses. Other companies including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield previously pulled out of some Obamacare markets after losing hundreds of millions of dollars in operating costs.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini said on Wednesday at a Wall Street Journal program that the Affordable Care Act exchanges had entered “a death spiral” in which soaring premiums have pushed out the healthiest customers, according to Reuters. Bertolini later issued a statement saying that Price and the Trump administration have \"taken some good initial steps with the proposed regulation.\"\n\nBut the proposed rules drew sharp rejoinders from health care experts and other critics. Some warned that the new rules – which are subject to public review and comment – could discourage younger, healthier people from enrolling because of the truncated enrollment season. They also said the rules could reduce financial assistance for low and moderate-income families while forcing some people into plans with significantly higher deductibles.\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said in a statement, “Very significantly, the Administration has completely reneged on its promise to lower deductibles. Instead, they are increasing cost-sharing and cutting back financial assistance for coverage.”"

    "text": "The ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the Intelligence Community appears to be reaching a dangerous crescendo with a pair of reports out Thursday morning that suggest unsustainable levels of mistrust and acrimony between the White House and the agencies charged with keeping the country safe.\n\nIntelligence officials have begun holding back information in the daily briefing Trump is supposed to receive about threats to national security, according to The Wall Street Journal. The report stresses that the information being kept from Trump is related to the sources and methods used to gather intelligence, not about the actual threats themselves.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nIn a statement Thursday morning, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence denied the report. \"Any suggestion that the U.S. Intelligence Community is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true,” the statement said.\n\nAt the same time, The New York Times reports that Trump is planning to launch a “broad review” of the structure of the Intelligence Community, possibly helmed by Trump’s friend Stephen A. Feinberg, a private equity billionaire with no experience in national security or intelligence issues.\n\nThe reason intelligence agencies are withholding information from Trump is that they are reportedly concerned about ties between Trump’s inner circle and the Russian government. Those worries were exacerbated this week by reports in Times and CNN that during the presidential campaign Trump aides and associates were in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officers.\n\nTrump’s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced out after reports surfaced indicating he had misled the administration about the extent of his discussions with a Russian diplomat prior to Trump taking office.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nThe Journal story backs up a report from New York Observer columnist and former National Security Agency official John Schindler, who earlier this week made a similar claim.\n\nAt the same time that the agencies in the Intelligence Community are doubting Trump’s trustworthiness, the president himself is apparently feeling the same way about them. In public comments and tweets over the past several days he has repeatedly complained about leaks of information about his campaign’s ties to Russia. The president has alternately blasted the press for stories he calls “fake news” and criticized the Intelligence Community for allowing sensitive information to be leaked, naming the FBI and the NSA in particular, which seems to imply that the so-called \"fake news\" has a basis in fact.\n\n“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy,” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “Very un-American!”\n\nOn Thursday morning, the tweets continued. “Leaking and even illegal classified leaking has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!” he wrote. And, “The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!”\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of ‘Unbelievable Turmoil’ in Trump’s White House\n\nAs with many of Trump’s tweets, it was unclear precisely what motivated Thursday’s pre-7 a.m. eruption, but The Times report of a potential White House review of the Intelligence Community would presumably include some sort of investigation into how closely guarded information from Russian officials’ intercepted phone calls was provided to the media.\n\nAnd Trump isn’t the only one concerned about the leaks. House Oversight and Investigations Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who has come under fire for his refusal to mount any substantive inquiry into connections between Russian intelligence and the Trump administration, nevertheless called for an inspector general investigation of the intelligence community’s leaks to the media.\n\nIn a letter to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, co-signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, the he wrote, \"We have serious concerns about the potential inadequate protection of classified information here. In light of this, we request that your office begin an immediate investigation into whether classified information was mishandled here.\""

    "text": "Can a successful businessman actually succeed as head of state and government with no prior experience in political office? The first four weeks of the Donald Trump administration has produced decidedly mixed results, but at the same time offered some glimpses of hope for populist voters.\n\nFor the last few decades, voters and activists have openly argued that the biggest problem with government is that it’s run by politicians. Frustration with government inaction – or in some cases too much action – have fueled efforts to impose term limits on legislatures in order to turn out the lifers. The founding fathers never meant for political office to be a career, the argument went, but for citizens to serve their country for a short period of time and then return to the private sector.\n\nRelated: Another Body Blow to the Trump White House as Labor Pick Withdraws\n\nThat includes the presidency. Constant stories of waste, fraud, and abuse anger voters, prompting an almost constant refrain: If I ran my business this way, I’d be out of business. What this country needs, they argue, is an outsider who knows how to run a private-sector organization – someone without the political ties and big-donor relationships that inevitably bring back to the same old failures and frustrations. That would lead America back to greatness – or at least reverse decades of stagnation and bureaucratic bungling.\n\nDespite these long-argued beliefs, only in 2016 did America roll the dice in a presidential election. Republicans nominated their first presidential candidate without public sector or military command experience, and then US voters gave him the job. Donald Trump embodied the anti-establishment fervor that has percolated for decades.\n\nTo be fair, Donald Trump is a rarity in big business. His business is private. He doesn’t answer to shareholders and a board of directors. His performance and behavior aren’t scrutinized by human resource surveys, 360 reports and other employee and down-the-line manager assessments of top management that could humble even a Bill Gates. And unlike most top CEOs, Trump probably doesn’t have a management coach.\n\nAs it turns out, running government requires a different skill set than running businesses, even though the two overlap to a large degree. Trump’s inexperience in governance has created some of his problems, while some problems have carried over from the campaign. The story of Russian intelligence contacts with key campaign officials, revisited this week by The New York Times, offers the best example of this gap.\n\nRelated: Don’t Bet on Trump Getting Impeached Just Yet\n\nTrump had run his primary campaign relatively light on consultants and pollsters, insisting that he could bankroll himself and save voters and taxpayers money. That made for a very popular argument on the campaign trail, and Trump clearly didn’t suffer from a lack of support because of it. However, the campaign didn’t effectively vet the smaller coterie of strategists and consultants who did make it into the campaign, leaving no one to question whether their economic ties to Russian businesses might leave them vulnerable to intelligence access.\n\nThe Times’ report on an FBI investigation of those ties states that campaign officials had numerous connections to suspected intelligence operatives, but that no evidence of cooperation with those operatives has emerged. It has still resulted in an embarrassing turnover at the White House, with national security adviser Michael Flynn resigning on Monday night. Perhaps this might have happened anyway, but a president with previous experience in vetting employees with political considerations in mind might have seen this kind of difficulty on the horizon sooner rather than later. It may not be a coincidence that Vice President Mike Pence, a seasoned political hand, has taken over the process of selecting Flynn’s replacement.\n\nThe White House has argued that Flynn was a victim of the “deep state” and of bureaucrats, and that may well be true. Still, that teaches another lesson the hard way to those without experience in governance. In private business, loyalty and action typically run up and down within the organization, and even the factions that develop are largely contained within the whole and not from outside the business.\n\nRelated: Merkel Deports More Refugees While Blasting Trump’s Refugee Ban\n\nThat is not true in government, and especially not within Washington DC in any Republican administration. A CEO president might expect that his orders will get carried out by people afraid to lose their jobs, but bureaucrats have civil-service protections and loyalties to parties and ideologies. It takes time, considerable patience, and skills on gathering consensus to make lasting change in Washington.\n\nBusiness tycoons do not necessarily believe in consensus as much as they believe in coming out on the winning end of deals. Rushing action without that consensus and buy-in from key stakeholders resulted in the other major stumble in Trump’s first month: his executive order on a temporary block on entry to the US by nationals from seven countries with higher risks for terrorist infiltration.\n\nRather than wait to consult with the agencies involved or even to get a legal team together first to defend it, the White House rushed it into enforcement and provided the media with a cornucopia of video hits to emphasize the impact of the policy. A judge stopped enforcement of the order with a temporary restraining order, and the administration then lost a chance to win an appeal because of the disorganized approach to the defense of the EO. That policy remains on hold, whereas someone more acquainted with the pitfalls of governance would have seen those attacks coming and been prepared to meet them.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of ‘Unbelievable Turmoil’ in Trump’s White House\n\nDo these stumbles refute the argument that a CEO president like Trump can work? Not yet. After all, we have only gone four weeks into this experiment, and signs have already begun to emerge that Trump and his team have learned some important lessons. Flynn’s likely replacement is a vice-admiral with a record for low-key professionalism. The pace of EOs out of the White House has come almost to a stop after the Chief of Staff Reince Priebus redefined the promulgation process to make sure they give no excuses for a judge to stop them.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has delivered on key campaign promises even through these controversies – an experience that many voters believe only a few get, and rarely at that. His lack of political nuance has resulted in taking on big issues, including an effort on significant deregulation and cutting back on bureaucratic red tape. It will take longer than just four weeks to see if Trump remains committed to those projects, but he didn’t take long to at least get them started.\n\nThat’s why voters are likely to keep giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. They want to believe in the businessman model of governance. If Trump delivers on his promises while learning his lessons on the best way to achieve them, he’ll sail to another term in office. If not, it may be a long time before we hear anyone seriously suggest that government should be run like a business by someone outside of the system."

Wallach and Justin Talbot-Zorn argue that the move is “evidence of a radical disconnect between a handful of influential House Republicans and nearly everyone else—including the scientific community, leading cybersecurity experts, and even the White House—who contend that voting vulnerabilities are a serious problem.”\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nWallach is a professor in the computer science department at Rice University and a Rice Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy. Talbot-Zorn is a Truman National Security Fellow and public policy consultant who previously worked on Capitol Hill.\n\nWallach and Talbot-Zorn point out that the move to get rid of the EAC comes at a time when 40 states are using electronic voting machines that are at a minimum 10 years old and that use computer systems highly vulnerable to outside intrusion.\n\n“Across the country, independent observers have found electronic voting systems to be astonishingly insecure,” they write. “These problems have yet to be fixed.”\n\nThey say that the situation is fixable but will require a bipartisan effort to develop new standards and best practices for both the machines Americans use to count their votes and the overall way in which elections are conducted.\n\nRelated: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nHowever, they add, “Any new voting security overhaul would almost certainly have to be implemented, at least in part, by the Election Assistance Commission, the very entity the lawmakers are attempting to gut.”\n\nThat’s worth remembering the next time a Republican member of Congress stands up to complain that widespread voter fraud is a real problem. Because it’s hard to believe that and believe the EAC should be eliminated at the same time."

    "text": "President Trump’s streak of success in getting controversial cabinet nominees through a closely divided Senate broke on Wednesday, with the news that Andrew Puzder will remove his name from consideration for the position of Secretary of Labor. The news arrives in the midst of a tumultuous week for the new administration, which is facing calls for Congressional investigations into connections between the president’s campaign staff and Russian intelligence officials.\n\nPuzder’s nomination has long had a question mark hanging over it. The wealthy CEO of the CKE fast food restaurant chain, Puzder was very slow to submit his financial disclosure forms and other documents necessary for an ethics screening. He also faced severe criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress for various positions he has taken over the years.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of ‘Unbelievable Turmoil’ in Trump’s White House\n\nDemocrats wanted to block Puzder because they saw his nomination to head the Labor Department as an insult to workers. Puzder is anti-union and has called for the abolition of minimum wage laws, positions Democrats saw as antithetical to the Labor Department’s mission “To foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.”\n\nMany Republicans were baffled by the choice because of Puzder’s history of advocating immigration reforms that would make it easier for low-skilled people from other countries to enter the US legally and find work. Trump had campaigned on a stridently anti-immigrant platform, promising to build a wall on the Mexican border and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn recent days, allegations of spousal abuse that arose in a divorce proceeding decades ago were raised after former television host Oprah Winfrey provided members of Congress with a recording of an interview with Puzder’s ex-wife in which she made claims of physical abuse.\n\nRelated: Can Trump Deliver 4% Growth? Why Most Economists Say Not This Year\n\nThe decision to pull out of the nomination process came as Puzder was approaching his long-delayed Senate confirmation hearing. A source told CBS News that the nominee was “very tired of the abuse.”\n\nHis departure deprives Trump of a Labor Department chief who shares his unique views about the way employment is measured in the US, but who was rapidly losing support from Congressional Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told the administration on Wednesday that he did not believe Puzder had the votes to be confirmed by the whole Senate because as many as seven Republicans were planning to vote against him.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the defeat of a cabinet nominee would be a major blow to a new presidential administration. But the way things have been going for the Trump White House in the last 48 hours, there’s a non-trivial chance that the failure of the Puzder nomination feels less like a defeat than a welcome distraction."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/IRS-Has-Just-Made-Obamacare-s-Individual-Mandate-Optional",
    "text": "When President Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office designed to weaken the Affordable Care Act, some questioned whether the instructions to federal agencies to look for ways to ease the law’s burden on businesses and individuals would have any real bite.\n\nBut on Tuesday, there can be little doubt Trump is succeeding in hastening the demise of a program that currently insures more than 9 million Americans. That’s because the Internal Revenue Service responded by weakening the health care law’s requirement that individuals either acquire health insurance or pay the penalty.\n\nRelated: There’s Less to Trump’s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest\n\nThe “individual mandate” to purchase health insurance or pay the penalty is the bedrock of the 2010 Affordable Care Act because it forces younger, healthier Americans who might otherwise gamble and go without coverage to join the Obamacare risk pool and help offset insurers’ costs in providing coverage to older, sicker people. That requirement – seen by Republicans as an kind of pyramid scheme and intrusion on personal liberty – has been enforced by the IRS, until now.\n\nSince the formal launching of the health care program in 2014, taxpayers have been given the option of checking a box on line 61 of their 1040 federal tax returns declaring whether or not they or members of their family have qualified health insurance -- and providing documentation to prove it. Even with this voluntary approach, the IRS collected individual mandate payments from 8.1 million tax returns in 2015 averaging $210 for a total of $1.7 billion, according to an analysis of IRS data by Investor’s Business Daily.\n\nFor the coming 2016 tax season, the IRS planned for the first time to make it mandatory for taxpayers to check the box or face not having their tax returns processed and their tax returns withheld. In other words, the IRS decided to crack down on scofflaws.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nBut according to a report by the website Reason.com, the IRS has abandoned this get-tough approach and will continue to grant taxpayers the discretion of checking the box to indicate whether they have health coverage or have paid the penalty to relieve them of that responsibility.\n\n“The Trump Administration has the authority to go a lot further than this in weakening the individual mandate,” said Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “But, this does send a signal that they're not going to enforce the mandate rigorously, and that’s not welcome news for insurers. Of course, Congress may make this all irrelevant by repealing the mandate entirely.”\n\nObamacare, with a projected cost of $1.2 trillion over 10 years, has been beset by skyrocketing premiums, the collapse of more than 20 experimental non-profit co-ops and major financial losses by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield and others that have been driven out of some of the markets.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled back about $4 million to $5 million radio and TV advertising by the Department of Health and Human Services to attract younger people to enroll in the 2017 insurance season.\n\nRelated: Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?\n\nAfter a relatively strong start, enrollment for Obamacare’s 2017 season began to sag after Trump took office Jan. 20 and stepped up his criticism of the program. Slightly more than 9.2 million eventually signed up for coverage in the 39 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov insurance marketplace, down from the more than 9.6 million who signed up last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted the news that Humana had become the first major insurer to announce it was dropping out of the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2018, citing it as another example of the failure of President Obama’s signature health care plan and the need “to repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans.”\n\nThe IRS said that technically, taxpayers are still legally required to have health insurance or pay the penalty – but the IRS has the discretion as to whether to enforce that requirement or not. But the latest move by the IRS has raised serious legal questions for some.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nMichael Cannon, the health policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an interview that the Trump administration under the Constitution is required to enforce the mandate unless Congress decides to change the law.\n\nEven while the Trump has broad discretion in implementing laws, “The president does not get to say, we are not enforcing that law over there, and therefore people don’t have to obey it, or winking at the law over there – it’s still the law,” Cannon said. “What the IRS is doing here is tacitly deciding not to enforce the law, and that’s not lawful, that’s unconstitutional,” he said.\n\nHowever, Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute, questioned whether the new IRS policy would have any profound impact on the fate of Obamacare. “I think it’s more of a political statement to Trump’s political base than a real change in effective policy,” he said in an interview."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/Mike-Pence-s-Public-Embarrassment-May-Have-Silver-Lining",
    "text": "When people talk about the office the vice president of the United States, it’s almost inevitable that someone reaches back into history toward FDR’s two-term second-in-command, John Nance Garner, who memorably described the office as being “not worth a bucket of warm piss.” The remark is said to have made Roosevelt laugh out loud when it was conveyed to him and it’s been passed down as the conventional wisdom about the office ever since. It was hammered home by Garner’s statement in retirement -- that accepting the nomination had been “the worst damn fool mistake I ever made.”\n\nBut for the past 16 years or more, the job of the vice president has been very different from the one Nance despised. Joe Biden in the Obama White House and Dick Cheney under George W. Bush were both deeply engaged in formulating administration policy and marshaling support in Congress. At critical times in both administrations, both Cheney and Biden were deputized to negotiate with lawmakers and to strike deals that both sides understood the president would honor.\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of ‘Unbelievable Turmoil’ in Trump’s White House\n\nGiven the current turmoil in the Trump White House, though, the office may be reverting back to “warm piss” status.\n\nIt’s unclear just what role Vice President Mike Pence is playing in the administration, how empowered he will be with regard to politics and policymaking, and, frankly, how much weight his word will carry on Capitol Hill. That’s because this week it became clear that the vice president is not in President Trump’s inner circle.\n\nIn January, with rumors swirling about his alleged contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office, now former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn told Pence that he had not discussed lifting economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Pence then went on national television to repeat Flynn’s claims.\n\nOn January 26, the Justice Department informed the White House that Flynn had apparently misled Pence and other members of the administration. According to multiple reports, wiretap intelligence indicated that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian Ambassador.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nRemarkably, even though White House Counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus informed the president immediately, Pence was kept in the dark until February 9. Worse, according to his spokesperson’s comment to The Washington Post, he learned about it not from the president but from media reports.\n\nAt this point, absent some sort of public statement from Trump that affirmatively asserts that Pence has authority within the administration, it’s hard to see how the vice president can claim to speak for the White House on matters of policy. Members of Congress, business leaders, interest groups and others sitting across the table from Pence could and will ask themselves whether what he’s telling them really reflects the thinking of the president and his closest advisers.\n\nOf course, this was always a danger in a Trump presidency, as Pence knew, or should have known when he accepted the vice presidential nomination. When a man as mercurial as Trump has revealed himself to be is sitting in the Oval Office, there would always be the possibility that policies articulated in good faith by his surrogates would be subject to change without notice.\n\nHowever, when the evidence that Pence was treated with manifest disrespect during the Flynn affair was added to the mix, the vice president’s ability to act as the voice of the administration has presumably been badly damaged.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nIn truth, Trump and Pence were always an unlikely match. Pence, the former Indiana governor, describes himself as a “born-again evangelical Catholic” and has long been a fixture in the conservative movement, especially with respect to culture war issues, including gay rights and abortion. These are areas in which Trump expressed little interest except when it became politically necessary for him to do so.\n\nTrump’s selection of Pence was part of what made his deeply unconventional presidential campaign palatable to many conservatives. The assumption was that Pence would have a seat at the table, and would be able to steer the Trump administration toward more traditionally conservative positions.\n\nThe silver lining for the vice president is that, given the direction things are heading for the Trump administration, he might not even want to be close to the center of power at this point. By Wednesday morning, the reports of a Russian connection to Trump’s presidential campaign had expanded well beyond Flynn, with both The New York Times and CNN reporting that aides and associates of the president were in frequent contact with Russian officials, including intelligence agents, during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAs calls for Congressional investigations multiplied, Trump himself took to Twitter to spout two seemingly contradictory complaints. The stories about his campaign’s connections to Russia, he said, are “fake news” and “conspiracy theories” driven by the media’s “blind hatred” of the president. But in practically the same breath, Trump denounced the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claiming that they were responsible for leaking classified information, seemingly a tacit admission that the reports are accurate.\n\nRelated: How Long Can Trump Go Without Firing Somebody?\n\n“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” he wrote.\n\nWorries about the stability of the leadership structure in the executive branch have begun seeping into the military. On Tuesday, the four-star Army General in charge of Special Operations Command expressed concern about the “unbelievable turmoil” in the White House, adding “I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war.”\n\nAmidst the uncertainty, talk of impeachment or Trump’s eventual resignation has started to be taken very seriously by longtime observers of Washington. And as a result, how Pence handles himself in the coming weeks will be very closely watched.\n\n“No question, Pence has to be embarrassed by this turn of events,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “But his major mistake so far has been getting entirely too close to Trump and parroting some of the silly things Trump and his inner circle have been saying.”\n\nHe added, “It is far from inconceivable that Pence will be president during the current term, and his ability to govern may well depend on whether enough people see him as somewhat independent. To use a historical parallel, Pence wants to be Gerald Ford to Trump's Richard Nixon. So having some distance could be a very good thing for a vice president who has seemed sycophantic so far.”"

    "text": "President Trump’s first legislative act was to sign into law a repeal of a transparency rule aimed at keeping public oil companies in check with regard to their international operations and limiting the scope for bribery and corruption.\n\nPart of the so-called Dodd-Frank Act, devised after the 2008 financial crisis to avoid a repeat of the events that led to it, the rule stipulated that U.S. public oil companies must declare all payments made to the U.S. and foreign governments and agencies in the form of royalties and taxes, starting from their financial year ending in or after September 2018.\n\nIt was an Act that Big Oil was very vocally against, saying the rule put it at a disadvantage to its foreign peers. Many of these foreign competitors are based in Europe, however, and are bound by similar regulations issued by the EU, supporters of Dodd-Frank have argued. Public companies in Canada and Norway are also required by their stock market regulators to disclose this information.\n\nRelated: Could Trump End Up Saving the Export-Import Bank?\n\nAccording to a Lugar Center analyst, senior fellow Jay Branegan, this is “grossly inflated”. The Lugar Center’s founder, Senator Richard Lugar, was one of the authors of the transparency rule.\n\nEarlier this month, the House and the Senate both approved the repealment of the rule, using a 1996 piece of legislation, the Congressional Review Act, which allows them to cancel legislation that had been introduced within the last six months with a simple majority.\n\nSince its appearance, the Act has only been used once but Trump himself and members of his administration, as well as congressmen, have suggested it is likely to be invoked much more often from now on.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/15/Democrats-are-Desperate-New-Faces-Where-Will-They-Find-Them",
    "text": "President Trump taunted a group of Senate Democrats last week by declaring that “Pocahontas is now the face of your party,” an obnoxious reference to his chief nemeses, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), whose claim to Cherokee heritage once became a bone of contention.\n\nThe former Harvard professor and consumer protection champion with impeccable progressive credentials relentlessly attacked Trump during the 2016 campaign and then led the charge against Trump’s nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to become to become attorney general. Her stock within the Democratic party soared after she was formally silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Senate floor last week for allegedly violating Senate rules by impugning a fellow senator’s reputation.\n\nRelated: Democrats Will Regain Power If They Can Avoid Screwing Up\n\nAt age 67, Warren can hardly be considered a fresh face within her beleaguered party – one that is still struggling to make sense of its devastating losses to Trump and the Republicans. She and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 75, are among a handful of aging progressive leaders who clearly better understood the mood of the electorate – and the importance of shifting left on economic and trade issues—than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ever did.\n\nBut whether Warren is the new “face” of the party – or more likely just one facet of a blurry, emerging composite picture of the Democrats reconstituted party leadership – remains to be seen.\n\nEven before the rank and file Democrats began to grasp the enormity of their loss to Trump and the GOP, veteran Democrats in the House and Senate solidified their hold on the congressional party for at least another two years. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, succeeded retiring Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada as Minority Leader, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, 76, put down a minor rebellion to claim the leadership of her party for at least another two years.\n\nWhile Schumer and Pelosi are both highly accomplished veteran politicians – and now are showing some spunk in demanding an independent probe of the burgeoning national security scandal in the Trump White House -- both appeared to be caught flat-footed by last November’s election when the Republicans swept to victory again in the House and Senate and took the White House.\n\nRelated: Will Democrats Stand Up to Trump? Here’s Their First Test\n\nMoreover, Schumer was recently put on notice by progressive Democrats – who actually demonstrated outside of his apartment in Brooklyn -- that he would be making a big mistake if he supported any Trump nominees and that he should scrap his post-election pledge to seek common ground with the new president.\n\nMeanwhile, the race to chair the beleaguered Democratic National Committee after months of upheaval within that organization appears to be coming down to two candidates – neither of whom is a household name. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Muslim to serve in Congress, has drawn strong support from Sanders, the AFL-CIO and other progressive groups seeking a shift in party policy much further to the left. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez is considered more of a moderate and “big tent Democrat” who has picked up an endorsement from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile the outcome of the DNC election later this month no doubt will have an important impact on the future direction of the party, the race has been relatively low key and obscure and certainly has done little to fire the imagination of Democrats throughout the country.\n\n“Empirically, Democrats are down,” said Nathan Gonzales, a national political analyst. “They have the fewest number of governors in at least a generation – just 16 out of 50. They have the minority of the House, the minority of the Senate, there are just fewer Democrats in leadership positions. The bench is less full, and that filters down into the state legislatures.”\n\nCan Trump Deliver 4% Growth? Why Most Economists Say Not This Year\n\n“Not only is the party dealing with fewer members, but there is no clear leader,” he added in an interview. “And you have a battle going on [within the DNC] for the best path out of the wilderness, with at least two different factions arguing what that path looks like.”\n\nAnd their party’s prospects for making a comeback anytime soon seems dim at best. Indeed, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the former Democratic White House chief of staff and Democratic congressional party organizer, recently advised the Democrats to take “a chill pill” and realize party rebuilding could take years to achieve. With Democrats facing uphill battles in the Senate and House in 2018, some experts had already all but ruled the chances of the Democrats winning back either of the chambers.\n\nUniversity of Virginia political scientists Larry J. Sabato notes that, in the wake of Trump’s chaotic and highly controversial first three weeks in office, the Democrats “have got more public support now than they had before the election, and you have to make hay while the sun shines.”\n\n“But certainly, the line-up in the Senate for 2018 is horrible for Democrats,” he added, as the Democrats will have to defend 25 seats, including many in states that Trump carried, to only eight Republican seats that will be on the line. The Republicans currently hold a 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate. “The Democrats will be very lucky to lose, net, only a couple of Senate seats,” Sabato said in an email.\n\nRelated: The Power of the Pink Hat: Here’s How Democrats Can Win America Back\n\nBut when it comes to the next presidential contest, Democratic voters seemingly have much stronger views. Just as conservative Republicans and independents flocked to Trump in search of an outsider who would challenge the establishment and upend conventional wisdom, recent polling suggests that Democrats and independents want a completely fresh start in 2020.\n\n“I think it will be somebody who is not even on the radar today,” Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist, said in an interview. Not unlike former President Barack Obama’s rise from relative obscurity as a senator to the pinnacle of national power, Baker said, “I think it will be somebody who is not a recognized, revered leader.”\n\n“The quest for novelty is not unique to Republicans,” he said. “I think the Democrats are looking for something different as well.”\n\nSome 66 percent of Democrats and independents picked “someone entirely new” when given the choice of a list of potential 2020 presidential candidates, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in late December. Only nine percent of those Democrats surveyed believe a newcomer should stay out of the race.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThere was practically no interest in seeing Clinton run for a third time for president with 62 percent of the registered Democrats surveyed saying she should definitely not seek the nomination again. Sixty-one percent said they would love for former first lady Michelle Obama to run, although she has pretty much slammed the door on that possibility.\n\nAround 44 percent said they might be in favor of seeing Sanders or even Biden seek the nomination to challenge Trump, assuming he runs for a second term. But just 34 percent said they would like to see Warren run, while 27 percent hope she doesn’t run – which hardly makes her the face of the Democratic party.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, there is no telling how the next two years will play out in Washington – and who among the Democrats in politics, business or some other endeavor may rise to the surface and lead the party.\n\nFor now, at least, here are six Democrats who offer a relatively fresh look who may emerge as important players in the coming years:\n\nSen. Christopher Murphy -- The first-term Connecticut senator arrived in Washington shortly after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in his state in December 2012, and he swiftly rose to become one of the most outspoken advocates for gun control – a highly important but invariably frustrating issue to pursue in the face of the powerful gun lobby. The 43-year-old former House member and state legislator is a champion of health care reform and was a strong advocate of a “single-payer” national health care system similar to one sought by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nSen. Cory Booker – The 47-year-old former Newark, N.J., mayor and prominent black politician insists he’s not interested in the presidency. And he finds ways to anger both liberals and conservatives, as Politico recently noted. But his high-profile speech at the 20016 Democratic National Convention and his sharp critique of President Trump and his cabinet picks suggest Booker will be very much in the national eye as the 2020 race begins to take shape.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar – The former Minnesota county prosecutor is a rising star among progressives and brings the much-admired qualities of mid-western common sense and practicality and a firm grasp of domestic and foreign policy issues. Klobuchar, the daughter of a legendary Minneapolis newspaper columnist and one-time legal adviser to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, is a natural in dealing with the media. And speculation that Hillary Clinton had closely considered her as a running mate in 2016 will probably add to her luster as a potential presidential candidate in 2020.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema – The 37-year old two-term House member from Arizona brings a distinctive perspective to Washington. The former state legislator and social worker grew up homeless for a time and is the first openly bisexual member of Congress. >She is one of the more dazzling Democrats from a red state. “I was homeless when I was a kid,” she said once at a Phoenix job fair. “But I got my shot at college, I got a job, and I stand before you today.”\n\nMark Cuban – President Trump recently tweeted that Cuban is “not smart enough to run for president!” But those who have dealt with the Dallas Mavericks owner and “Shark Tank” star think he is plenty smart – and probably better equipped than Trump to do the kind of policy and economic analysis required of a president. Trump may have been reacting to a New York Post story mentioning Cuban as a possible challenger for Trump in 2020. Cuban, 58, responded by tweeting “Isn’t it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern?”\n\nSen. Kamala Harris – The charismatic Democrat from California has a number of claims to fame: She was the first woman ever elected attorney general in California and the second black woman and the first Indian American elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. Harris, 52, once said that she sought a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be “at the table where decisions are made.”"

    "text": "The classic Watergate question has resurfaced repeatedly this week now that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has resigned, leaving unanswered questions about the ties between Russia and the Trump administration: What did the president know, and when did he know it?\n\nThe tumult in the White House less than a month into Trump’s presidency has ignited chatter about impeachment. “Gambling houses all over the world are taking in action on whether Trump, inaugurated just last month, will resign or be impeached,” Politico reported on Sunday, before Flynn resigned. “And the odds aren’t as long as you might think.” Irish bookmaker Paddy Power now offers 2/1 odds that Trump will be impeached in his first term, and 4/1 odds that it will happen this year.\n\nThat still may be a bad bet. Impeachment would be a heavy lift. Here’s why:\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nImpeaching a president is a little like indicting someone, except in this case, it requires extraordinary measures:\n\nA vote for impeachment from the House of Representatives, requiring a supermajority.\n\nCharges of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” such as such as perjury of oath, abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty.\n\nHouse members acting like prosecutors on each article of impeachment, present their case to the Senate in a special hearing, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nPresidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached and acquitted. Richard Nixon was impeached but resigned before hearings could begin.\n\nAn impeachment scenario is unlikely for President Trump unless some unexpected crime is unearthed. There’s also the fact that Republicans hold the majorities in both houses of Congress, so getting that supermajority would be a stretch. Maybe that’s just as well, given the turmoil that would cause for this nation. On the other hand, Trump hasn’t released his tax returns, hasn’t placed his businesses in the equivalent of a blind trust to be managed by another real estate company, and hasn’t apologized to the millions of people he bullied, insulted and stepped on to be the 45th president of the United States."

    "text": "In order to maintain a stockpile of aging nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, the U.S. government will need to spend an average of $40 billion per year over the next decade, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe report, a biennial review last completed in 2015, finds that “The nation’s current nuclear forces are reaching the end of their service life ... Over the next two decades, essentially all of those nuclear delivery systems and weapons would have to be refurbished or replaced with new systems to continue operating. Consequently, the Congress will need to make decisions about what nuclear forces the United States should field in the future and thus about the extent to which the nation will pursue nuclear modernization plans.”\n\nRelated: 4-Star General Warns of ‘Unbelievable Turmoil’ in Trump’s White House\n\nThe United States currently has about 6,800 nuclear warheads, about 2,800 of which have been retired and are waiting to be broken down, according to the Arms Control Association. A little over 4,000 warheads are stockpiled, meaning that they are available for use but not currently deployed. The U.S. has 1,367 warheads deployed on various delivery vehicles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear-capable bombers, and submarines.\n\nThe 10-year cost of maintaining the nuclear arsenal jumped by 15 percent over the last estimate, a rate of growth that CBO warns is likely to increase as the average age of the weapons in it increases.\n\nThe 10-year spending breakdown is as follows:\n\n* $189 billion for “strategic nuclear delivery systems and weapons.” This includes missiles, long-range bombers and submarines.\n\n* $9 billion for tactical nuclear delivery systems and weapons. These include airplanes armed with shorter-range, lower-yield weapons.\n\n* $87 billion for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons laboratories\n\n* $58 billion for the Department of Defense’s “command, control, communications, and early-warning systems.”\n\nNone of this takes into account the possibility that President Trump might press for an expansion of the arsenal, which has been slowly shrinking in recent decades due to arms control agreements.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nDuring the presidential debates, Trump claimed that “Russia has been expanding” its nuclear arsenal and has “a much newer capability than we do.” Arms control experts challenged his assessment of the Russian stockpile, but Trump was apparently undeterred.\n\nIn December, after his election but before he was sworn in as president, Trump tweeted that “United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\"\n\nThe news on Tuesday that Russia has deployed new nuclear missiles, which U.S. officials claim are in violation of a 30-year-old treaty governing medium-range missiles, may weigh on the new administration’s decision-making when it comes to the maintenance and potential expansion of the U.S. arsenal."

    "text": "Donald Trump is not the only head of state trying to protect against the possibility that refugees may also be terrorists. He’s just the most open about it.\n\nIn an outburst of brazen hypocrisy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel blasted President Trump’s temporary travel ban, saying it is “not justified to put people from a specific background or faith under general suspicion” to combat terrorism. Meanwhile, Merkel is doing back flips to rid her country of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from mostly Muslim countries who have flocked in through her open doors.\n\nRelated: Under Fire, UK's May Criticizes Trump Curb on Refugees\n\nJust days after lashing out at Trump over his executive order, Merkel announced efforts to expedite expulsions of refugees who have failed to win asylum in Germany. In 2016, more than 150,000 people seeking sanctuary in Germany were rejected; only about 25,000 were expelled. Today, there are more than 200,000 people living in Germany who should be deported. Chancellor Merkel would like those people gone.\n\nWhy the sudden urgency? Put it down to the terror attack in December when a Tunisian refugee drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 50 others. The attacker, Anis Amri, had sought asylum and had been turned down; apparently, Tunisia was unwilling to take him back.\n\nIt wasn’t the first such incident. In July last year, a Syrian who had been denied asylum and who had declared allegiance to ISIS set off a bomb outside a wine bar in Ansbach, killing himself and injuring more than a dozen.\n\nAs Merkel’s political standing has been hit by growing concerns that her admission of one million refugees has created a security nightmare, she has gotten tough on deportations and on Muslim assimilation. In a recent speech in Cologne, she said, \"Anyone who does not have a right of residence must be returned to their home country.\"\n\nRelated: Factbox: What's in Trump's Order Halting Refugee Program\n\nShe particularly targeted Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (majority Muslim countries), classifying them as “safe countries of origin” in order that their applications can be processed quickly, and those rejected can be returned home asap. To coax those governments into cooperating, Merkel’s government hinted that development aid could be withheld.\n\nNot only does Merkel want to toss out those without legal status, but she also insists that those who do achieve legal residency must “integrate” properly.\n\nMerkel, whom the Financial Times says “leads Europe’s fight for liberal values,” also supported outlawing the Muslim veil, calling it “inappropriate.” Those comments came in late December after the arrests of two asylum seekers in connection with three sexual assaults, including the rape and murder of a medical student. Her Vice Chancellor doubled down, saying, “Salafist mosques must be banned, the communities dissolved and the preachers should be expelled, as soon as possible.\" Yet Merkel criticizes Trump.\n\nWhile Germany wants to send refugees home, Australia and Kenya want to send them to the U.S.\n\nRelated: Australia Causing Refugees 'Severe and Lasting Harm': Human Rights Watch\n\nAustralia refuses to allow asylum seekers who arrive by boat to settle in the country. Instead, because of a law passed in 2013, the nation stockpiles refugees in Australia-run immigration detention camps in the poor Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Two refugees desperate to get to Australia recently set themselves on fire at the camp in Nauru.\n\nIt was some 1,300 of those mostly Muslim asylum-seekers that President Obama agreed to allow into the U.S. In addition, there were 370 who had been allowed into Australia temporarily for medical treatment. It appears that coincident with that offer (hatched at Obama’s Summit on Refugees last September) Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull agreed to take part in the U.S.-led program to resettle Central American refugees from a camp in Costa Rica – mostly people who had been trying to cross into the United States.\n\nSo in a politically expedient arrangement, the U.S. agreed to take refugees that Australia does not want from the Middle East, Africa and Asia and Turnbull bails out Obama by accepting Central Americans desperate to enter the U.S. who are holed up in Costa Rica. No wonder that in his first conversation with the Australian leader, President Trump described the deal as “dumb” even as his executive order carved out an exception so that the agreement would be honored.\n\nRelated: After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream\n\nDealing with refugees and the threat they pose is not just a problem for the developed world. Kenya’s government is trying to shut down the world’s largest refugee camp, home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who have fled their violent country. The courts in Kenya halted the closure, saying it was an act of “group persecution, illegal, discriminatory, and therefore unconstitutional.”\n\nThe government claimed the camp had been linked to terror attacks carried out by Somalis, like the one at Westgate Mall, where 67 people were killed in September 2013. Rebutting human rights activists’ claims that refugees were not responsible, a spokesperson for the government said, \"I will tell you for a fact, the people who carried out the terror attacks at Westgate, several of them were traced either through phone calls or through various contacts — intelligence — to refugee camps in Dadaab.\"\n\nSome 200 of those Somali refugees in Kenya were recently en route to the United States but then were blocked by President Trump’s executive order calling for more robust vetting for asylum-seekers. Because of the court’s intervention, those Somalis are now again heading for the United States.\n\nAs the refugees from Australia and from Kenya start to arrive in the United States, our country will be torn between our humanitarian instincts and the realization that other countries have suffered heavy penalties for opening their doors. It’s easy to see why a majority of our generous country thinks Trump’s desire for “extreme vetting” makes sense."

    "title": "Are Republicans Losing Momentum on Obamacare Repeal?",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/14/Are-Republicans-Losing-Momentum-Obamacare-Repeal",
    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and his top lieutenants put on their best game face Tuesday morning, insisting that they and the Trump administration were well on track to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act this year. They appeared unfazed by the mounting concerns of consumers, insurers, health care executives and governors that the GOP may be headed down a treacherous path.\n\n“I fully recognize and respect the strong feelings that people have about this issue,” Ryan told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. “We should be passionate about this issue. It is about people’s lives. This affects every person and every family in America.”\n\nRelated: The GOP’s Big Tax Dilemma: Repealing Obamacare Taxes\n\nRyan argued once again that Americans are trapped in a Democratic-concocted health care system with runaway premiums and co-payments and limited choices. “This law is in a collapse, and we have an obligation to rescue people from that collapse,” he declared.\n\nBut if anything is collapsing at this point, it is the already shaky consensus among Republicans in the House and Senate over how – or even whether – to proceed in making good on their campaign pledge to dismantle and replace Obamacare. President Trump and congressional Republican leaders already have missed self-imposed deadlines repeal and replacement legislation and now appear to be taking a more piecemeal approach to cobbling together elements of a plan.\n\nMoreover, some moderate Republicans are pressing for alternative proposals that would “repair” rather than replace Obamacare or even allow states to choose whether to continue with the existing program or opt for a more conservative, market-driven system.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was always assumed that the Republicans would have a much tougher time pushing a budget resolution and related legislation through the Senate than the House. That’s because of the GOP’s seemingly unstoppable 247 to 188 seat majority in the lower chamber, in contrast to the Republicans’ narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate. The defection of just three moderate Republicans in the Senate potentially could grind to a halt the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nBut 40 or so members of the House’s far right Freedom Caucus blew up that political calculus Monday night after agreeing among themselves to refuse to support anything but the most extreme version of Obamacare legislation, comparable to the 2015 legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House and Senate and vetoed by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nThat bill was essentially a nuclear option for ridding the country of Obamacare. The legislation repealed the mandates for individuals to buy insurance and employers to provide insurance. The measure eliminated the law’s premium subsidies for low-income Americans and wiped out the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed to finance the operation of the government-operated health care exchanges. And it rolled back expanded Medicaid coverage for millions of poor adults who previously had no coverage – a provision strongly backed by Republican and Democratic governors alike.\n\n“If it’s less than the 2015 [legislation], we will oppose it,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chair of the Freedom Party, told reporters Monday night. Meadows also said that he and his members might demand simultaneous action on repeal and replacement legislation – something virtually impossible to achieve. It is the worst kept secret in town that Trump and congressional leaders are nowhere near agreement on a plan to overhaul the health care law without stripping 20 million or more Americans of their current coverage under Obamacare.\n\nFor the time being, the GOP leaders’ best hope is to push through a measure repealing most of Obamacare while hoping they can subsequently enlist Democratic support on replacement legislation that preserves many of Obamacare’s most popular features, like the ban on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26.\n\nBy staking out arguably the most extreme approach to ending Obamacare, Freedom Caucus members have left Ryan, McConnell and other Republican leaders with practically no wiggle room in negotiating with insurers and health care providers or placating more moderate members of the two chambers who are beginning to freak out about growing protests by voters in their districts and states.\n\nAnd if the Freedom Caucus members balk at negotiating a less extreme budget resolution that preserves some elements of the existing law, then Ryan will have a tough time mustering a minimum of 218 votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s ‘Repeal and Replace’ Obamacare Is Becoming ‘Repair and Fix’\n\nRyan, Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas and Greg Walden, chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, have adopted a more piecemeal approach, holding hearings on various elements of a replacement plan – such as health care savings accounts and new ways of differentiating the premium rates between younger and older applicants – and vowing to stitch them together eventually, in consultation with Trump’s new secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price of Georgia.\n\n“We are taking a step by step approach, so people can see the changes that we are making and see how they will help,” Ryan said today. “And working with Secretary Price, we will have a stable transition where no one has the rug pulled out from under them while we work towards a better, more stable system. So this step by step approach will rescue people from Obamacare’s collapse and give every American access to affordable, quality health care.”\n\nYet by taking this more deliberative approach, the Republicans have begun to lose momentum – giving their opponents more opportunity to galvanize public opinion against the GOP approach. “I don’t know if it’s perilous for the Republicans, but certainly I would say that the speed is slipping,” Michael Tanner, a health care policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an interview.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nOne of the Republicans’ biggest fears is that while they dither over a strategy and plan to replace Obamacare, the existing subsidized private health care market will begin to collapse, with major insurance companies continuing to bail out of the program and millions of Americans threatened with the loss of coverage or even higher premiums next year.\n\nThe Trump administration has promised to provide some “market stabilization” to get the insurers and consumers what is certain to be a rocky transition period, but the insurance companies are beginning to make demands contrary to the views of the Freedom Caucus and other more conservative lawmakers.\n\nFor instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association lobbyists presented an industry-backed plan to officials of the White House and Department of Health and Human Services Feb. 6 that calls for preserving premium subsidies for low-income Americans and the mandate requiring everybody to buy insurance until Republicans can create state “high risk pools” for providing coverage to older and sicker people. The industry proposal, first reported by Axios, would also permanently repeal Obamacare taxes on insurers and others.\n\nThe question of what to do about Obamacare taxes, which underwrite the cost of the health care plan and generate roughly $1.1 trillion over a decade, is a particularly thorny question. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and other members of the Freedom Caucus favor totally eliminating the taxes as part of the Obamacare repeal, but that would leave the GOP with few resources to fund their alternative approach.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a health policy consultant and sharp critic of the Affordable Care Act, asserted today that for all of their challenges, Ryan and other GOP leaders were making headway on assembling a feasible replacement plan.\n\n“Obamacare was failing, it was unstable, and we just had an enrollment period that’s going to do nothing to change that,” he said in an interview. “All of the ideological arguments aside, Obamacare has to be fixed.”"

    "text": "As Republicans and Democrats alike press for an intensive investigation into ties between the Russian government and the nascent Trump administration, concern about the ability of the White House to manage a national security crisis has apparently spread into the highest ranks of the U.S. military.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, speaking a conference on special operations and low intensity conflict near Washington, a prominent four-star general suggested that the chaos in the White House, which saw the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn late Monday night, could bleed into the military’s readiness.\n\nRelated: With Flynn Out, Trump Faces Pressing Questions About National Security\n\nGeneral Raymond A. Thomas, who leads the Pentagon’s Special Operations Command, told his audience, “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil,” The New York Times reported. “I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war.” He said that his command has remained “focused” on its mission. However, he also told the Times, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.”\n\nThe announcement that Flynn had resigned came just hours after a top White House adviser said the retired Army general still enjoyed the “full confidence” of the president. It also followed the revelation, by The Washington Post, that the Department of Justice warned the White House weeks ago that Flynn appeared to have had illicit contact with Russian officials and might be susceptible to blackmail.\n\nDespite the warning from DOJ, Flynn was allowed to continue receiving briefings on the nation’s most sensitive secrets. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway confirmed Flynn’s continued participation in intelligence matters in an interview on ABC Tuesday morning.\n\nThe revelation that Flynn was allowed to remain in the White House Situation Room has infuriated critics of the Trump administration, including Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\n“General Flynn’s resignation is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus,” McCain said in a statement Tuesday. “As our nation confronts the most complex and diverse array of global challenges since the end of World War II, it is imperative that the President select a new national security adviser who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government.”\n\nHe added, “General Flynn’s resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia, including statements by the President suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections.”\n\nOther senior senators, including the Senate’s second-ranking Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, have called for an investigation into Flynn.\n\nSpeaking on a radio program, Senate Intelligence Committee member Roy Blunt said that he believes an investigation is necessary and the Flynn ought to be called to testify before Congress.\n\n“I think everybody needs that investigation to happen,” he said. “And the Senate Intelligence Committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principle responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn’t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Tough Stance on Iran: Nothing to Gain, a Lot to Lose\n\nDemocrats joined in, with top party leaders also calling for immediate investigations into any White House-Russia connections and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee telling colleagues in a closed-door meeting that more revelations about Flynn’s connections to Russia are likely to come out in the next few days.\n\nHowever, Republicans continue to command all the levers of real power in Washington, and those in place to mount a serious investigation of the Trump administration were notably reluctant to do so on Tuesday morning.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, of California, told CNN on Tuesday that he would not be investigating the White House’s connections to Russia, suggesting that the president could be protected by executive privilege.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Tuesday morning that he had not made up his mind about calling on Flynn to appear before his panel.\n\nHouse Oversight and Investigations Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, said Tuesday morning that he saw no need to investigate Flynn, saying “I think that situation has taken care of itself.”"

    "text": "The resignation of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn Monday night, just hours after one of President Trump’s closest advisers said that he enjoyed the chief executive’s “full confidence,” raises alarming questions about the new administration’s ability to put national security ahead of the president’s personal ties to his aides.\n\nFlynn, the retired three-star Army general who rose to prominence in Trump’s orbit during the presidential primary, bowed out after weeks under a cloud of suspicion that he had illicit contact with Russian officials prior to Trump’s inauguration and may have suggested that sanctions levied on the Kremlin by then-president Obama would be eased after Trump took office. Matters worsened after it was revealed that Flynn misled the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the content of his discussions with a Russian official.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nIf the fact that Flynn was allowed to remain in the position after apparently lying to Pence wasn’t troubling enough, it was reported Monday night that the Department of Justice had previously informed the White House that it believed the National Security Adviser could be subject to blackmail by Russia.\n\nActing Attorney General Sally Q. Yates informed the White House in late January that an ongoing investigation into Flynn’s ties to Russia had revealed that the Kremlin might have undue influence over the man charged with briefing the president on the most serious and sensitive issues of national security. Yates was fired by the president shortly thereafter, over her refusal to implement his executive order banning refugees and citizens of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the US.\n\nDespite the Justice Department’s concerns, and in the face of other reports that the Army is investigating whether Flynn broke the law by accepting payment from the Kremlin-run RT television channel for an appearance in Moscow, Flynn retained access to the nation’s most closely held secrets and, according to aides, to the president’s trust.\n\n“Yes, Gen. Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said in an appearance on MSNBC just hours prior to the announcement of Flynn’s resignation.\n\nRelated: How Long Can Trump Go Without Firing Somebody?\n\nConway’s comment was followed, minutes later, by a seemingly contradictory statement from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who told reporters that the President was “evaluating the situation” with Flynn.\n\nUnder normal circumstance, the resignation of a National Security Adviser under suspicion of being influenced by the country’s biggest rival on the world stage would throw the White House national security operation into chaos. However, by all accounts, it was already there.\n\nCareer staff on the National Security Council were already frantic with concern about their status within a new administration in which young staffers with virtually no experience in national security affairs were allowed to chair their meetings, and political staff, from the president on down, treated some classified material in a strikingly cavalier fashion.\n\nThe White House reported Monday night that Flynn’s position will be filled on a temporary basis by another retired general who supported Trump on the campaign trail, Keith Kellogg. Like Flynn a former Lieutenant General, Kellogg had been serving as his predecessor’s deputy but is not widely expected to hold the job on a permanent basis.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nOne of the many questions now facing the Trump administration is where the president will turn for Flynn’s replacement. With the administration’s relationship with the Intelligence Community already in tatters over his repeated accusations that the nation’s spies have acted against him personally, the IC will surely be watching closely to see if Trump looks for a candidate who can repair their damaged confidence in the administration.\n\nBeyond that, the nation as a whole will be watching to see how -- and if -- Trump addresses reports that he allowed an aide potentially compromised by a hostile foreign power to retain access to the nation’s most closely guarded secrets and influence over how the government acts on them.\n\nTrump has shown little willingness to address the Flynn issue. In separate press conferences in recent days, he has accepted questions only from friendly news outlets, like the Daily Caller website and Sinclair Broadcasting, which could be counted on not to bring up Flynn.\n\nHowever, at this point, it’s difficult to see how even the most obsequious reporter could fail to demand an explanation for the Flynn affair from the president and his representatives."

    "text": "Republicans profess to believe in state’s rights. In their view, states ought to use their laboratories of democracy to experiment on policy with limited federal interference. Except for national security and defense, Washington should get out of the way of Albany and Madison and Denver and Santa Fe.\n\nBut now that Republicans have taken over all levers of federal power, this principle of non-intervention in state affairs no longer applies when a state wants to do something GOP leaders don’t like. In fact, congressional Republicans are moving to stop California from a potential solution to one of the biggest challenges of the century: the retirement crisis.\n\nRelated: The Government Is Holding Millions in Unclaimed Retirement Money\n\nGolden State lawmakers asked a simple question: How can we stop the epidemic of people entering retirement with no savings, forced to live off meager Social Security benefits? While Social Security was never intended to be the only leg of the retirement stool, that’s become the reality for far too many. According to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report, nearly one-third of all Americans have no retirement savings or pension. And one reason for that is the lack of retirement savings choices on the job.\n\nAround 55 percent of California workers do not have access to a workplace retirement plan. Combine that with the median U.S. household holding an astonishingly low $2,500 saved for retirement, and it’s a recipe for poverty in old age.\n\nSo the California state legislature passed a plan called Secure Choice. Anyone without a choice of a 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan, roughly 7.5 million Californians, would have 3 percent of their earnings automatically deposited in an account similar to an Individual Retirement Account. This could, over time, max out to 10 percent, though workers could dial down that percentage or even opt out entirely. A state board would manage the fund, placing the money first in safe investments like Treasury bonds, and later in a diversified portfolio.\n\nRelated: 8 Things You Need to Do to Get Ready for Retirement\n\nThe accounts would be portable to any job, have low costs (capped at 1 percent) and relatively low risk and give workers the chance to see savings grow over time. Eight states in all have passed laws to enact similar retirement plans, and nearly two dozen more are considering the idea. But the participation of the nation’s largest state creates forward momentum to ensuring that everyone has access to a retirement savings plan.\n\nUnder the current timeline, large businesses would start implementing Secure Choice in 2018, with smaller businesses given more time. About 1.6 million Californians would become eligible in the first year. But Republicans could derail the effort.\n\nLast August, the Department of Labor issued a final rule clarifying how these state savings plans would interact with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under current law, any retirement plan established by an employer with an auto-enrollment feature becomes an ERISA employee-benefit plan.\n\nRelated: Retirement Incomes Falling Short in All but 3 States\n\nERISA pre-empts all state laws related to employee benefit plans. That could make Secure Choice and other state initiatives subject to lawsuits from employers who don’t want to administer them, or investment advisors who want to block competition. It would also increase disclosure and reporting requirements for employers who would just be conduits for the state plans, by deducting money from employee payroll.\n\nTo ameliorate this, the Labor Department clarified that auto-enrolled plans like California Secure Choice would not count under ERISA. But the rule didn’t get finalized until August 2016, putting it within the window for Republicans to overturn it under a previously obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act. Between now and May, Congress can pass a resolution of disapproval rolling back any Obama-era rules finalized after June 2016. If President Trump signs the resolution, the rule gets rescinded, and no future rule that’s “substantially similar” could be passed without Congress’ express consent.\n\nCrucially, these resolutions are not subject to the filibuster. So with a simple majority in the House and Senate, Republicans can blow out dozens of individual Obama-era rules. For the next several months, this will be the main deregulatory effort in Congress.\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem — Here Are the Worst 10\n\nLast week, two House Republicans introduced resolutions to rescind the Department of Labor rules for state and municipal retirement plans. That puts the future of Secure Choice and any similar program in jeopardy.\n\nWhy would Republicans care whether California wants to offer this for its workers? The programs are self-sustaining and put no taxpayer dollars at risk, merely expanding access to retirement plans. While Republicans claim that exempting state plans from ERISA means workers lose critical consumer protections, the spectacle of the same gang that wants to cripple the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suddenly concerned about rip-offs makes no sense. And the Republican position also contradicts that principle of limited government and state’s rights. So what’s up?\n\nPart of it is pure ideology. “Our nation faces difficult retirement challenges, but more government isn’t the solution,” said Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI), who co-authored the new resolution. He’d rather small businesses partner to offer retirement plans to employees, something that simply hasn’t happened previously.\n\nRelated: A Big Reason Workers Aren’t Saving More for Retirement\n\nBut Walberg lets his slip show. A state-run program offers superior portability, while employer-based programs cannot be moved from job to job. What typically happens is that an investment advisor comes in to roll over workplace plans from a former employer into IRAs. And the advisory industry doesn’t want to lose that lucrative opportunity to rack up fees on savers. Indeed, the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group, was the main opponent of California Secure Choice.\n\nAs journalist David Sirota points out, investment and insurance interests have given $515,000 to Walberg for his campaigns over the years, and a similar figure to co-author Francis Rooney (R-FL), himself a former investment company CEO.\n\nCalifornia Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, the architect of Secure Choice, is trying to figure out how to save the program, even if Republicans kill the Labor Department regulations. De León could argue in court that the auto-enroll plans comply with the spirit of ERISA anyway. He may even use a statewide ballot measure to put Secure Choice on stronger legal footing.\n\nRegardless, Republicans acting on behalf of their donors want to inject significant uncertainty into the process, and stymie state initiatives that could help people save for retirement. It shows that state prerogatives when the federal government refuses to act matter less than ideological purity and investment company profits."

It’s not enough to say that he abused his wife (she has denied it) and that 60 percent of his restaurants have violations (fewer than 1 percent had violations, according to Labor Department Wage and Hour data).\n\nThe latest accusation, from senior investigations editor David Sirota at the International Business Times, is that Puzder owes millions of dollars to UBS, a bank that could be in a position to benefit from favorable rulings if Puzder were confirmed as Labor Secretary. Sirota suggests that Puzder is disqualified due to conflicts of interest.\n\nBut Puzder has no financial interest or investments in UBS.\n\nRelated: U.S. Senate Panel Receives Ethics Filings for Labor Nominee Puzder\n\nTake the “millions of dollars in loans,” for instance.

However, since he filed the forms, he sold his home in California, leaving him with one mortgage of around $990,000, and a personal line of credit for which he owes about $125,000.\n\nA mortgage and a line of credit do not result in the borrower being under any obligation to the financial institution—except to repay the loans according to their terms. If mortgage borrowers were obligated to their lenders, then all nominees to Senate-confirmed positions would either have to rent their homes or own them outright. The only concern that a loan raises is if the loan were obtained under favorable terms, such as the loans that Countrywide made to former Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and other influential politicians in the mid-2000s.\n\nHow about Puzder’s so-called investments in UBS? True, Puzder’s ethics forms list an investment in UBS Dynamic Alpha Fund and 10 other UBS accounts. But these accounts are not investments in UBS, they are investments in funds or accounts managed by UBS.\n\nCharacterizing the Dynamic Alpha Fund as an investment in UBS is like saying that investors with retirement accounts in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund are investing in Vanguard. In order to invest in UBS, you need to own stock in UBS. Puzder doesn’t own stock in UBS, as can be seen from his public forms filed with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Choice for Labor Is Under Fire From the Left – and the Right\n\nFurthermore, the Dynamic Alpha Fund, reported at between $100,000 and $250,000 in value, is classified as an “excepted investment fund” under federal ethics rules. This means that the fund is (1) independently managed,” (2) widely held, and (3) either publicly traded, available, or widely diversified. As a result, the Office of Government Ethics did not require Puzder to sell it.\n\nThe other 10 UBS accounts mentioned in the article are brokerage accounts whose assets Puzder has reported on the Office of Government Ethics forms. Assets in these accounts include investments in household names such as Abbott Laboratories, Coca-Cola, Cisco, and Intel. Stocks in Coca-Cola in a UBS brokerage account simply do not count as investments in UBS. Besides, all of the holdings in individual companies will have to be sold when Puzder is confirmed.\n\nThe focus on UBS arises because UBS has admitted violating currency trading practices and has been sanctioned by the Justice Department. The sanction includes a prohibition on managing pension funds. However, the Labor Department under Secretary Thomas Perez in December issued a one-year waiver so that UBS could continue to manage its $22 billion in pensions and Individual Retirement Accounts. Later this year the Labor Department will have to decide whether to extend the waiver.\n\nRelated: Mcdonald's CEO Sounds Positive Note on Trump's Labor Nominee\n\nBart Naylor of the Public Citizen is reported by Sirota as saying, “How can [Puzder] referee its critical waiver from pension fund management penalties? Why does he omit UBS from his ethics statement [when] his investments are many?”\n\nNo matter that UBS was not omitted from the ethics statements, and that Puzder has no investments in UBS. Puzder has a general agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to recuse himself from any matter in which he has a financial interest. If indeed, he has a financial interest in UBS, he would not be involved in any rulings involving the bank.\n\nThe process for recusal is straightforward. If the Labor Department ethics officials judge that Puzder should recuse himself from decisions regarding UBS, then the UBS decision can be made by some other Labor Department official. It is not an infrequent occurrence.\n\nDavid Sirota is a known left-wing activist who agreed to be the CEO of True Blue Media, liberal activist David Brock’s “Breitbart of the Left,” before he changed his plans this week. A business reporter would know the difference between investments in UBS and investments in funds or accounts managed by UBS; a political hack out to smear Andy Puzder might conveniently blur the distinction."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/13/GOP-s-Big-Tax-Dilemma-Repealing-Obamacare-Taxes",
    "text": "As if they aren’t perplexed enough over how to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan that avoids stripping millions of Americans of their health insurance, congressional Republicans are sharply divided over whether to repeal hundreds of billions of dollars’ of Obamacare taxes.\n\nHere’s the problem: Any replacement program will cost a lot of money, maybe even more than Obamacare’s $1.2 trillion price tag over ten years. So if the ACA and all of its mandates are repealed, the GOP will have to raise taxes.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nOn the far right, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the former chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said last week that Congress and the administration must abandon any thoughts of “repairing” Obamacare and move ahead to fully repeal the program -- including the taxes that have been used to finance it the past four years. “I would argue Obamacare is so bad, you got to get rid of every single bit of it,” he told Fox News. “Every tax, every regulation, every mandate.”\n\nBut more moderate or pragmatic Republicans dismiss Jordan’s approach as foolhardy and reckless, and one that would deny their party sufficient resources to keep Obamacare operating throughout a lengthy transition period while bringing a new GOP health care system on-line. “These are sources of revenue you just can’t discount,” Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA), a member of the centrist House Tuesday Group, told the Associated Press. Meehan said that the money could help create “a soft landing and coverage for those who currently rely on Obamacare.”\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), has seconded that argument, noting that “Whatever we do in replacement is going to cost some money,” in the form of tax revenue or deep offsetting cuts in other areas of the budget.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\n\n\nFor years, Republicans have targeted the Democratic-imposed tax increases as a ripe target for demolition. The Obamacare taxes are a combination of Medicare tax increases and additional federal and state taxes aimed primarily at high-income earners. When the Democratic-controlled Congress passed the ACA in 2010, it required hospitals, the health insurance industry, medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies to help finance the program because of the huge profits they would likely accrue from millions of new paying customers.\n\nRepublican critics of Obamacare have long denounced those additional taxes – especially the 2.3 percent medical devices tax, a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning services, and taxes on brand-name drugs and health insurance companies selling policies on and off the government exchanges as harmful to businesses. They have also sharply criticized two other Obamacare tax hikes on the earnings and investments of high-income earners making more than $250,000 a year.\n\nBut there is compelling evidence that if the Republicans choose to move ahead and scrap all the existing taxes hikes as part of an overall repeal of Obamacare, they will simply not have enough revenue to finance a replacement plan that comes anywhere close to insuring the 20 million Americans who currently benefit from Obamacare. Those insured include about 9 million through the exchanges, or about 2.8 percent of the population, and another 10 million through expanded Medicaid.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s ‘Repeal and Replace’ Obamacare Is Becoming ‘Repair and Fix’\n\nAfter claiming at one time they could repeal and replace Obamacare this year almost overnight, President Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill are currently on the defensive. They face searing complaints from insurers, the health care industry, consumer groups, Republican governors and Democratic protesters about the growing chaos in the health care markets and the GOP’s inability to produce a credible alternative.\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are urgently seeking ways to “shore up” the Obamacare insurance markets and prevent more insurers from pulling out amid the growing uncertainty and instability triggered by the GOP pledge to dismantle the system. One of those measures would provide billions of dollars more to the insurance companies to subsidize out-of-pocket costs and deductibles for millions of lower-income consumers.\n\nRegardless of what approach the Republicans ultimately take – whether a total repeal and replacement of Obamacare phased in over a lengthy transition period or some variation of Obamacare that preserves its most popular provisions while adding more conservative, market-based features – Republicans will need a lot of money to make that happen.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the existing Obamacare taxes would generate about $1.1 trillion in revenues between 2016 and 2025 without any changes. A Brookings Institution analysis released in late December estimates that only 40 percent of the $1.2 trillion cost of the ACA’s expansion from 2019 to 2026 would be available to Congress and the White House if the taxes were repealed.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nThe Republicans could generate as much as $850 billion of the total needed through a number of budgetary and tax maneuvers, including the use of “dynamic” budget scoring to claim $200 billion of new revenues through economic expansion. There has also been talk of capping the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance to pick up another $100 billion or so, although there isn’t a lot of support for that.\n\nWhat’s more, if Trump were to break a campaign pledge not to cut spending on Medicare as part of the GOP effort to replace Obamacare, he likely would trigger a massive backlash from the Democrats, the AARP and other seniors’ advocates.\n\n“Obviously they are stuck in a dilemma,” Paul Ginsburg, director of the Brookings Center for Health Policy, said in an email today. “Basically, if you repeal all the ACA taxes, which Republicans have long wanted to do, then you are only left with 40 percent of the cost of the coverage expansion in order to pay for a replacement. Once you get rid of all of the taxes and all of the coverage provisions, you’re left with only about $500 billion in your pocket.”"

    "text": "On Sunday, North Korea launched a missile into the Sea of Japan for the first time since US President Donald Trump took office.\n\nSouth Korean officials told Reuters the missile, a land-based adaptation of the submarine-launched KN-11, doesn't have the range to strike the US but has another trait that's just as troubling, if not more — solid fuel.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nNorth Korean missiles usually rely on liquid fuel and have to be gassed up like you'd fill up your car.\n\nNorth Korea, like many nuclear powers, mount their nuclear-capable missiles to trucks.\n\nRoad-mobile missile launchers can hide easier, launch from almost anywhere, and take an enemy by surprise — but liquid fuel complicates all that.\n\nTo launch a liquid-fueled missile, a giant convoy of military trucks must drive out to a location, fuel up the rocket with the multiple types of fuel for the different stages of launch, and then fire away. This requires dozens of trucks and associated military personnel. Such a large-scale deployment is much harder to conceal from a vigilant foe.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\n\"Liquid-fueled missiles are more vulnerable to tracking and preemptive strikes. Solid-fueled ballistic missiles are not fueled on site and therefore pose more of a threat because solid-fueled ballistic missiles require less support and can be deployed more quickly,\" Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy and a North Korea expert at the Arms Control Association, told Business Insider.\n\nUsing a missile like the one tested on Sunday, North Korea could simply park a truck and let a missile fly.\n\n\"Another striking feature of the test was the transport erector launcher that was used to launch the missile. Images indicate that it ran on treads rather than wheels,\" said Davenport. \"This allows North Korea to move its missiles through more difficult terrains.\"\n\nTo counter such a sneaky launcher, an adversary would have to spend extensively on surveillance and recon technology.\n\nSo while North Korea remains without an ICBM to directly threaten the US homeland, their successful launch of a solid-fueled missile means they have developed a very destabilizing technology that can strike US military bases, South Korea, or Japan in a moment's notice.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/13/How-Long-Can-Trump-Go-Without-Firing-Somebody",
    "text": "Over the weekend a top aide to President Trump boasted about the speed with which the new administration is moving to enact its agenda. “The President of the United States has accomplished more in just a few weeks than many Presidents do in an entire administration,” said Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nWhile there’s no disputing the fact that Trump and his team have been extremely active in the first few weeks of his term, the new administration is also threatening to set another speed record: shortest time to a major staff shake-up.\n\nRelated: National Insecurity: Intel Officials Increasingly Worried About Trump\n\nWhile rumors of staff infighting and potential dismissals and resignations are the standard stuff of reporting on any White House, the sheer bulk of stories about very senior figures in the executive mansion who find themselves in doubt about their future is stunning, coming as they do less than a month into the new administration.\n\nIt’s generally assumed that the man standing on the thinnest of the thin ice is retired three-star Army General Michael Flynn, who now serves as Trump’s National Security Adviser. Flynn has been accused, by sources in the Intelligence Community, of discussing the lifting of Obama administration sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump officially took office.\n\nFlynn later denied that he had done so, expressing his innocence directly to Vice President Mike Pence who then went on television to defend him. Later, further leaks from intelligence operatives with access to intercepts of the calls claimed that Flynn had misled both the vice president and the public.\n\nLying to the vice president would likely be a fireable offense in any other White House, and Flynn’s status within Trump’s remains unclear. Miller, in television appearances over the weekend, declined to offer even the standard claim that Flynn enjoys the president’s “full confidence,” which assertion, by itself, usually signals that someone is in trouble.\n\nRelated: This Is What Undiluted Trumpism Tastes Like\n\nThe result is a National Security Council operating in crisis mode, with career staff unsure not just of the new administration’s priorities, but about whether or not they will have the same boss when they wake up each morning.\n\nFlynn, however, is far from the only high-visibility staffer who might be in trouble. From his first moments behind the podium in the White House briefing room, Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been the target of ridicule in the media and reported criticism from within the Oval Office.\n\nOver the weekend, Washingtonian magazine reported that former Navy SEAL and early Trump supporter Carl Higbie was being considered a replacement for Spicer, which Higbie appeared to confirm. Trump has reportedly been unhappy with some elements of Spicer’s job performance and with mockery he has become, particularly on Saturday Night Live, where actress Melissa McCarthy has been lampooning him as a rage-driven fabulist.\n\nPossibly the most surprising person that Trump is said to be considering for replacement is White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. There wasn’t much discussion about it until last weekend when Newsmax CEO and Trump friend Chris Ruddy had drinks with the president, then promptly went on CNN to rip into Priebus for “weakness” and poor communications.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nRuddy, in an interview with The Washington Post, repeated his criticism, saying, ““It’s my view that Reince is the problem. I think on paper Reince looked good as the chief of staff — and Donald trusted him — but it’s pretty clear the guy is in way over his head. He’s not knowledgeable of how federal agencies work, how the communications operations work. He botched this whole immigration rollout. This should’ve been a win for Donald, not two or three weeks of negative publicity.”\n\nHis statements earned Ruddy a couple of calls from the White House, as he reported on Twitter Sunday. “Reince just briefed me on new WH plans. Impressive! CNN today my personal view. Told him I have 'open mind' based on his results,” he tweeted. Later, he noted that Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner had also reached out to him. “Jared Kushner tells me COS Reince is doing ‘amazing job.’”\n\nNevertheless, his statements, and his relationship with Trump, naturally led to speculation that the former chair of the Republican National Committee might not be long for the chief of staff job. Mike Allen, of Axios, reported that there is speculation Trump might smooth Priebus’s exit by offering him a cabinet position.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nTrump has been publicly silent about the future of all three of the men, and at this point, it is unclear what constitutes a firing offense in his White House. Known to prize loyalty, Trump has received plenty of it from all three men who have taken plenty of slings and arrows on his behalf over the past year.\n\nBut loyalty to Trump is no golden ticket. Just ask Corey Lewandowski, the dedicated former Trump campaign manager who was ousted in the midst of the primary season and was not pulled into the administration after the election.\n\nTrump has demonstrated that he’s happy to cut someone loose if he decides their liabilities outweigh their benefits. At the moment, though, the balance sheet for Flynn, Spicer and Priebus is stored in his head."

    "text": "A blizzard of reports over the weekend about borderline panic among career national security officials over the Trump administration’s haphazard approach to dealing with intelligence reports and the President’s seemingly off-the-cuff approach to foreign policy left the impression of a White House practically adrift in the currents of world affairs.\n\nThe position of President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, continues to be in doubt after revelations that he appears to have misled other members of the administration, chief among them vice president Mike Pence, about his discussions with Russian officials prior to the inauguration. Flynn, according to intelligence officials who spoke to the Washington Post, explicitly discussed the possibility of lifting sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration, a grave breach of protocol and possibly a violation of federal law.\n\nRelated: Another Strike Against National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\n\nStephen Miller, the senior White House official dispatched to the Sunday talk shows, refused to discuss Flynn at all beyond praising his former service as an Army General. He left the impression that Flynn’s position in the White House is tenuous at best.\n\nUncertainty at the top has career officials on the National Security Council in a state of constant worry, The New York Times reported on Sunday, and the overtly political behavior of some new Trump-appointed staff has further shaken the traditionally nonpartisan body. Flynn’s deputy, former Fox News pundit K.T. McFarland, who once served as an NSC staffer, has reportedly used Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan in NSC meetings, and appointees are said to be carrying mugs with that logo into meetings with foreign officials.\n\nTrump himself continued to raise concerns about how seriously he takes national security issues over the weekend. On Saturday, North Korea took the provocative step of launching a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. The president, who was dining with the Japanese Prime Minister at his private club Mar-a-Lago when news of the launch broke, took a phone call from his national security staff in a crowded dining room while club members snapped cellphone pictures.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described the new administration as a “wrecking ball” that is “determined to just destroy everything” in its approach to foreign policy.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Tough Stance on Iran: Nothing to Gain, a Lot to Lose\n\nCorker revealed that when he was being interviewed by Trump and White House Strategist Steve Bannon as a potential Secretary of State nominee, he found himself disagreeing with the incoming administration on virtually everything: “in almost every case but maybe one.”\n\nMoving forward, he said, “The challenge is going to be… so you want to do deals, deals, deals. Or you want to disrupt this and this and this. You’ve got to decide toward what end.”\n\nThe most disturbing story to emerge over the weekend was also the least verifiable. In his column at the Observer, John Schindler, a former National Security Agency employee who now works as a consultant, claimed that high-ranking officials in the intelligence community have informed him that they are now withholding intelligence from the Trump administration out of concern that the administration cannot be trusted to safeguard it.\n\nA senior National Security Agency official explained that NSA was systematically holding back some of the “good stuff” from the White House, in an unprecedented move. For decades, NSA has prepared special reports for the president’s eyes only, containing enormously sensitive intelligence. In the last three weeks, however, NSA has ceased doing this, fearing Trump and his staff cannot keep their best SIGINT secrets.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Mexico Will Get a Much Bigger-than-Expected Bill for Trump’s Wall\n\nAnother official, Schindler said, told him that the Intelligence Community now believes that Russia has penetrated the White House.\n\nWhat’s going on was explained lucidly by a senior Pentagon intelligence official, who stated that “since January 20, we’ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM,” meaning the White House Situation Room, the 5,500 square-foot conference room in the West Wing where the president and his top staffers get intelligence briefings. “There’s not much the Russians don’t know at this point,” the official added in wry frustration.\n\nSchindler’s sources are not named, and there is no evidence for the claim that sensitive information is being withheld from the White House beyond their anonymous statements to him.\n\nBut given the antagonistic relationship the president has created between himself and the Intelligence Community, Schindler’s reporting is at least plausible, which by itself should be enough to scare anybody."

    "text": "Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn -- the former Army general, fake news aficionado and now apparently misleader of the vice president – is looking as gone as a wild goose in one of those winters we used to have before climate change came along.\n\nRelated: Out Like Flynn - Why Trump Must Dump the ‘Fake News’ General\n\nOn NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday morning, uber-prepared Trump adviser and Steve Bannon lieutenant Stephen Miller (who has the look and feel of a young Roy Cohn) declined to speak for the president when moderator Chuck Todd asked about the boss’s continued confidence in General Flynn.\n\n“That's the question that I think you should ask the president, the question you should ask Reince [Priebus], the chief of staff. I'm here today as a policy advisor. And my focus was on answering the policy questions that you have. General Flynn has served his country admirably. He is a three-star general. He [was] head of the defense intelligence agency. And I look forward to having more discussions about this in the future,” Miller said.\n\n“So the White House did not give you anything to say other than that on General Flynn?” Todd asked.\n\n“They did not give me anything to say,” Miller replied.\n\n“So you cannot say whether or not the president still has confidence in his national security advisor?” Todd persisted.\n\n“Asked and answered, Chuck,” said Miller. “It's not for me to tell you what's in the president's mind. That's a question for the president -- that's a question for a chief of staff. Asked and answered, Chuck.”\n\n“Let me ask you this, if you were caught misleading the vice president of the United States, would that be considered a fire-able offense in the Trump White House?” Todd asked.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Flynn Is Manipulating Trump on Russia. Where’s His Pink Slip?\n\n“It's not for me to answer hypotheticals. It wouldn't be responsible. It's a sensitive matter. General Flynn has served his country admirably. He served his country with distinction. And I look forward to having a conversation with you once you've had a chance to talk with the appropriate people in the White House who are dealing with this matter,” Miller replied.\n\nIn short, Miller had no problem speaking for the commander-in-chief on any topic raised by Todd – except for the latest Flynn conundrum.\n\nThe general is taking incoming fire for allegedly discussing President Obama’s sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office – and then misleading Vice-President Mike Pence about his discussions.\n\nOn the CBS program Face the Nation on Jan. 15, moderator John Dickerson asked Pence if talks between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak led Moscow to moderate its reaction to the sanctions imposed by Obama over meddling in the U.S. election.\n\nPence said he had talked with Flynn about the conversation with Kislyak and they “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”\n\nNow it certainly looks like Pence was misled.\n\nA Washington Post story on Friday said: “Current and former U.S. officials said that in [Flynn’s] conversation with Kislyak in late December, Flynn urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to punitive sanctions being imposed on Russia by the Obama administration, signaling that the Trump administration would revisit the issue when it took office.”\n\nIn other words, the designated National Security Adviser to the next president of the United States was advising one of America’s chief adversaries how to react to punitive measures imposed by the sitting president in retaliation for said adversary trying to disrupt the nation’s free and honest elections.\n\nOn Friday, an aide to Flynn said the general had \"no recollection of discussing sanctions\" but \"couldn't be certain that the topic never came up,\" according to CNN.\n\nRelated: Trump Adviser Had Five Calls With Russian Envoy on Day of Sanctions: Sources\n\nMiller was right about one thing: General Flynn’s bona fides as a dedicated and decorated officer are unquestionable. In fact, his performance in the war theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan as an analyst of military intelligence was by all accounts superior.\n\nAs a player in the national political theater, though, he has been appalling.\n\nFlynn’s behavior during the campaign – leading chants of “lock her up” and spreading bogus news stories -- was unseemly for a person of his intellect, but almost unimaginable for a former three-star general steeped in the unspoken rules of behavior attached to his rank.\n\nFlynn might want to revisit the military Code of Conduct. Yes, it applies to those in uniform, and Flynn has hung his in a closet. And yes, it is about what is expected of a soldier under arms, not of a civilian or a warrior who has put down his sword.\n\nBut the words of the code’s Article VI should still have some resonance. They read: “I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free.”\n\nOne of those principles is truth."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/13/If-Trump-Stacks-Its-Board-He-Politicizes-Fed-and-Demeans-Its-Independence",
    "text": "Daniel Tarullo announced on Friday that he is resigning from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in early April, nearly five years before his term expires on January 31, 2022. Governor Tarullo, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009, led the effort to plug the holes in financial regulation that allowed the housing bubble and financial panic to occur. So his resignation comes at an inopportune time for those of us worried about Trump’s plans for wholesale deregulation of the financial sector and the vulnerability to another financial crisis that comes with it.\n\nTrump could also have a large impact on how the Fed conducts monetary policy. With Governor Tarullo’s departure, three of the seven seats on the Board of Governors are open (two of Obama’s nominees were never confirmed), and Janet Yellen’s term as Fed Chair ends on February 3, 2018. Although she could stay on the Board until her term ends on January 31, 2024, traditionally when a new chair is appointed, the current Fed chair resigns (this opens up a position on the Board for the new chair, but with three open positions that tradition may not be honored).\n\nRelated: Trump Has a Chance to Remake the Federal Reserve\n\nBeyond that, Stanley Fischer’s appointment as Vice-Chair ends in June of 2018 and his term ends in January of 2020. Like Yellen, he could stay on until his term ends but there is no guarantee that he will. And, of course, there could be other resignations as well. I fully expect Trump will be able to appoint at least five of the seven Fed Governors by the end of his first term.\n\nWith a Congress that seems ready to rubber stamp his choices for important government positions rather than fulfill its “advise and consent” role, the conduct of monetary policy could change dramatically. If Trump politicizes the Fed, for example, by stacking the Board with people who will attempt to implement whatever policy he desires, the Fed could be permanently damaged.\n\nBoth Obama and Bush were able to appoint all of the members of the Board of Governors by the end of their second terms. The Board of Governors constitutes a majority of the twelve member committee that sets monetary policy, and the ability to stack the Board gives individual presidents far more influence over monetary policy than was intended when the Federal Reserve System was set up (if all Governors serve their full 14 year terms, a president can only appoint two of the seven Board members in a four year term, four of seven in two terms).\n\nThe fact that both Obama and Bush were able to stack the Board did not raise huge concerns since both nominated competent people and both respected the Fed’s independence. That’s not to say that there were no concerns at all. As noted above, for example, during both the Bush and Obama administrations some nominees were not confirmed (including a Nobel prize winner nominated by Obama whose qualifications were not in doubt).\n\nRelated: Top Federal Reserve Official Resigns as Bank Deregulation Looms\n\nBut despite the ideological differences over monetary and regulatory policy that led to these confirmation difficulties, Federal Reserve policy has been relatively consistent and effective from administration to administration over the last several decades. This is due in no small part to politicians respecting the Fed’s independence.\n\nTrump has already shown he has no respect for traditional political boundaries, and that being qualified is not a necessary condition for being appointed to fulfill an important role in his administration. Loyalty is all that matters. If Trump wants to, he will be able to stack the Fed with people, qualified or not, who will implement the monetary and regulatory policies he desires. Given his evident lack of knowledge about monetary policy – for example, he has said “Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful” – that could be a disaster.\n\nCan he be stopped? The first line of defense, the advise and consent role of the Senate, has already been compromised, and Trump is in the process of doing his best to mute a second line of defense -- the influence of economists. So far economists are conspicuously missing from his administration. I don’t expect the objections of economists to matter at all to Trump or to the Republicans in the Senate who must approve his nominations.\n\nRelated: Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry\n\nThat leaves the media and the public. Objections from the “mainstream” media won’t matter any more than the objections of economists and the media Trump depends upon will support him in any case. So there’s not much hope there either. As for the public, the people Trump cares about have been so misled about the Fed and the important role it played during the financial crisis and Great Recession that they will likely cheer whatever he does.\n\nSo long as Janet Yellen is still at the helm of the Fed, the institution has some protection. She has the authority to control the agenda at monetary policy meetings and prevent bad proposals from seeing the light of day. But her term as chair is over in less than a year and I don’t expect Trump to reappoint her. I hope I am wrong, but my fear is that her departure will be the end of the Fed as we know it, and the beginning of a Fed stamped with the Trump brand name in big “gold standard” letters with him as the CEO. That will irreparably compromise – bankrupt if you will – the Fed’s independence and its ability to conduct effective monetary policy."

    "text": "The U.S. farm economy has had a long, storied history of boom and bust.\n\nFarm incomes reached record highs as recently as 2013, leaving producers flush with cash and optimistic about the future. But the Department of Agriculture’s latest 2017 farm income forecast released last week offers a much bleaker picture of things to come:\n\nRelated: Farmers Are Getting a Bumper Crop of Subsidies from the 2014 Farm Bill\n\nNet farm income is forecast to decline by 8.7 percent to $62.3 billion -- the lowest level in nearly 15 years when adjusted for inflation. Receipts from wheat sales are likely to plunge by $1.4 billion or 16.6 percent compared to 2016. What’s more, the value of farm assets will dip by 1.1 percent, while farm debt is projected to surge by 5.2 percent.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t bad enough, the Wall Street Journal warned last week that another big agricultural financial bust may be on the way. “Across the heartland, a multiyear slump in prices for corn, wheat and other farm commodities brought on by the glut of grain worldwide is pushing many farmers further into debt,” the Journal’s Jesse Newman and Patrick McGroarty wrote.\n\nAmong the report’s more salient findings: The U.S. share of the global market is less than half of what it was in the 1970s -- falling from 65 percent of the world’s grain production to 30 percent today. A strong U.S. dollar is allowing overseas competitors to undercut U.S. prices. Some farmers are shutting down, raising the specter that the total number of U.S. farms may dip below two million for the first time.\n\nCraig Scott, a fifth-generation farmer in Ransom, Kansas, in the heart of farm country, lamented to the Journal reporters that “You keep pinching and pinching and pretty soon there’s nothing left to pinch.”\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Need to Know About the Farm Bill Deal\n\nFarming forever has been a high-stakes enterprise, with success or failure determined as much by the vagaries of weather, the relative value of the dollar and the shape of foreign markets as by a farmer’s skill in managing his land and planting the right crops. Farming has changed considerably over the past half century, with larger, more efficient, corporate farms absorbing smaller farms, or driving them out of business.\n\nBut one thing that hasn’t changed that much is the invisible hand of the federal government, which has heavily subsidized and propped up farmers over the years with hundreds of billions of dollars of assistance. The Farm Belt throughout the south, the Midwest, and the far West has long been a potent political force, and Congress has generally responded with generous assistance – even for some who don’t really need it.\n\nThe 2014 farm bill was hailed as a major breakthrough in agriculture spending reform, with changes that got rid of some of the most blatant boondoggles. Even so, the legislation called for nearly $1 trillion of spending over five years on agricultural programs and food stamps, with a lot of that money earmarked for programs to take some of the risks out of farming.\n\n“Agricultural businesses have a safety net that would be the envy of any industry,” said Joshua Sewell, senior policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense. Sewell argues that this sudden concern about declining farm incomes overlooks the fact that farmers were on an economic roll for several years and now must face up to a market correction.\n\n“Crop prices and farm incomes have reverted to their long-term norm after experiencing record highs from 2009 to 2013,” he said, hardly a cause for further government assistance.\n\nRelated: Food Stamp Use Is Falling, and the GOP Wants to Cut It Even More\n\nTaxpayers for Common Sense, a government watchdog group, has long made a cottage industry of closely monitoring federal agriculture programs that cover everything from subsidizing agriculture businesses to rural utilities to nutrition assistance. Some of these programs date back to the 1930s, during the Great Depression, and are hard to justify today. While the group applauded some of the reforms in the 2014 legislation, it denounced some of the changes as legislative sleight of hand.\n\nRepublican and Democratic negotiators agreed to cut roughly $19 billion in farm programs over five years. One of the biggest breakthroughs was the elimination of so-called direct payments. In the past, grain producers would receive payments each year totaling about $5 billion, regardless of the prevailing market prices or which crops, if any, they grew.\n\nWith the blessing of the Obama administration, Congress finally voted to get rid of the wasteful direct payments. Yet while taking away that subsidy, lawmakers quietly gave some of it back, as the Fiscal Times reported. Some of those savings from direct payments were added to a massive crop insurance program, in which the federal government covers losses from poor yields or declines in revenue.\n\nAccording to Sewell, the 2014 farm bill “put taxpayers on the hook for keeping these good times rolling,” by expanding federally subsidized crop insurance and creating two new subsidy programs – Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage.\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump’s Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\n“And we’ve been hooked,” Sewell said in an email late last week. “The most recent estimates put the price tag for ARC/PLC at $32 billion for the first five years of payments, $15 billion more than originally estimated, and crop insurance is still expected to cost an additional $8 billion a year.”\n\nSewell terms the latest round of bad economic news for farmers a “market correction” following years of good times, and insists that the government shouldn’t have to blunt the impact.\n\n“This market correction didn’t sneak up on anyone,” Sewell said. “Instead of looking to taxpayers for additional financial bailouts, we need to reform our ag policy to allow farmers to plant for a 21st-century market rather than Washington.”"

    "text": "On Sunday morning, anybody who turned on the political talk shows for their weekly cocktail of angry pushback and dubious facts from representatives of the Trump administration was instead handed a shot glass full of barrel-proof Trumpism. Straight. No Chaser.\n\nWhiskey aficionados know that the bottle of 80-proof liquor they buy in the store is really a watered-down version of what comes out of the barrel at the end of the aging process. Barrel-proof whiskey, which approaches 130 proof, isn’t for the faint of heart, so distilleries add water to make it more palatable to the average consumer.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Mexico Will Get a Much Bigger-than-Expected Bill for Trump’s Wall\n\nUntil now, Trump’s defenders have been cutting the administration’s policy demands with the slick avoidance techniques of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, or Vice President Mike Pence’s patented “more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger” rebuttals to awkward questions. But Sunday, the administration sent White House Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller, the 31-year-old former aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, to appear on four of the five major shows. (CNN is still in the doghouse, apparently.)\n\nFor those used to other Trump surrogates, Miller can’t have gone down easily.\n\nMiller’s default setting appears to be barely suppressed rage coupled with a deep sense of indignation that public reaction to the Trump administration’s policies is anything other than immediate and unquestioning acceptance. And in a week where a troubled White House is facing an unusually large number of scandals and embarrassments, he mounted a full-throated defense of virtually everything that came out of the West Wing over the past seven days.\n\nWhat did he think of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s insistence that the decision by the Nordstrom department store chain to stop carrying the president’s daughter’s line of clothes and accessories was a “direct attack” on Trump himself?\n\n“I do want to say that Sean Spicer, as always, is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important,” Miller said. “And I agree with it.”\n\nRelated: Trump Finds a New Use for His Bully Pulpit: Protecting the Family Business\n\nHow about Trump’s completely unsubstantiated claim that he lost the state of New Hampshire in the presidential election because of massive and organized voter fraud that involved busing out-of-state voters into the Granite State?\n\nOn the question of Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud, he said, “I’m prepared to go on any show, anywhere, anytime, and repeat it and say the President of the United States is correct 100 percent.” On New Hampshire in particular, Miller went even further, claiming that “the issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It's very real. It’s very serious.”\n\nThe claim left ABC host George Stephanopoulos practically agog in surprise, but he still managed to point out several times that Miller refused, when asked, to offer even a shred of hard evidence that the claim was true.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nMiller seemed particularly angry about the decision by a panel of federal judges in California to uphold an order blocking enforcement of the president’s executive order banning refugees and the citizens of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the US. He accused the judges, much as Trump had a few days earlier, of usurping presidential power. (And, in the process, accused them of believing the US should have no border controls at all.)\n\n“The president’s powers here are beyond question,” he insisted on Fox News.\n\n“There is no constitutional right for a citizen in a foreign country...to demand entry into our country,” he said on ABC. “Such a right cannot exist. Such a right will never exist. This is an ideological disagreement between those who believe we should have borders and should have controls and those who believe there should be no borders and no controls.”\n\nOn CBS, he declined to specify the administration’s strategy going forward, but promised, “The end result of this though is that our opponents, the media, and the whole world will see as we begin to take further actions that the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”\n\nRelated: Appeals Court Rules Against Trump on Travel Ban\n\nOne issue Miller flatly refused to discuss was the report that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed lifting US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before the Trump administration took office and that he misled Pence when he was asked about it. If the allegations are true -- both with regard to discussing sanctions with Russia and misleading the vice president -- there is much speculation that Flynn would have to be fired.\n\n“There's no information that I have as a policy director for this White House to contribute any new information to this story this morning,” he said on ABC.\n\nHowever, he was not reluctant to claim that the chaotic first weeks of the Trump administration have been a huge, even historic, success.\n\n“The President of the United States has accomplished more in just a few weeks than many Presidents do in an entire administration,” he insisted.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Fear Card as He Badgers Judges for Their Vote\n\nHow members of the public will react to Miller seething at them through their television screens will remain to be seen. But Miller didn’t need to wait to find out how the single most important member of his audience felt about his performance Sunday."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/10/Trump-Has-Chance-Remake-Federal-Reserve",
    "text": "The announcement Friday that Daniel Tarullo, one of the governors of the Federal Reserve, will be leaving the central bank in early April shines a light on how much immediate influence President Trump is going to be able to exert on the Fed within a relatively short time after he takes office.\n\nThe Fed’s governing board of seven members tends to turn over relatively slowly. Board members are appointed to 14-year terms, with only one expiration every two years, and only in even-numbered years. This typically means that a new administration may not have the opportunity to replace even a single member of the Fed board until the beginning of the second year of an administration.\n\nRelated: Trump the Populist Is Trying to Hobble a Champion of the Little Guy\n\nTrump, however, took office with two empty seats on the board, and the announcement of Tarullo leaves him a third to fill. And while none of the four remaining board members’ terms will expire before 2020, he’ll also have the chance to make another important pick next year.\n\nThat’s because under the Fed’s rules, the powerful role of Board Chair is awarded on a four-year basis. Current chair Janet Yellen’s membership on the board doesn’t expire until 2024, but her tenure as chair will end in 2018 if she is not reappointed. Should Trump elect to tap a different Fed chair, it is possible that Yellen would retire from the central bank altogether. In theory at least, by this time next year, a majority of the members of the Fed board could be Trump appointees who would have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThis is important for multiple reasons. The role of the Fed most familiar to the public is related to monetary policy. The Fed’s Open Market Committee meets several times a year to set the target for the Federal Funds Rate, which in turn affects the interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit card balances.\n\nThe members of the Board of Governors are permanent members of the FOMC, a panel that is fleshed out by a rotating cast of presidents from the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Governors, when all positions are filled, constitute a majority of the 12 voting members of the FOMC. The Fed Chair also chairs the FOMC and traditionally has considerable influence over the direction and pace of changes to interest rates.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nBut the Fed’s role extends well beyond monetary policy into the regulation of the financial services industry. The central bank has oversight authority over most US banks -- and all major ones -- and is also charged with maintaining broader stability in the financial services marketplace.\n\nTrump, who regularly attacked the financial services ties of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, has nevertheless shown considerable deference to it in his appointment of cabinet members and close advisers.\n\nThe people he appoints to the Fed Board will have considerable influence over regulatory decisions, including how existing rules are enforced and how future rules are written.\n\nThis is particularly true with the departure of Tarullo. The Fed board has a position for a vice chair in charge of bank oversight, but it has gone unfilled for several years. Tarullo, who had a strong interest in regulation, became the central bank’s de facto chief regulator in recent years, picking up many of the responsibilities that would have gone to the vice chair.\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Romance With Big Labor Is Headed for the Rocks\n\nIn fact, there is speculation that it was the prospect of having that portfolio effectively taken away from him by a new Trump appointee that led Tarullo to announce his departure.\n\nTrump, still struggling to get his cabinet nominees confirmed, likely won’t make any moves with regard to Fed appointments in the immediate future. But within 12 months, the central bank of the most powerful economy in the world could have a very different look than it does today."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/10/Republican-War-Obamacare-Just-Took-Big-Step-Forward",
    "text": "The Senate’s pre-dawn vote on Friday to confirm Rep. Tom Price of Georgia as the next secretary of health and human services was a pivotal moment in the Trump administration’s increasingly high stakes effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and perhaps fundamentally change the nature of the federal health care system.\n\nThe Senate voted 52 to 47 along strict party lines to confirm Price, who was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence at the White House later in the morning. His confirmation process was slowed by the Democrats due to a controversy over his dubious trading in medical and pharmaceutical company stocks while he helped write legislation affecting some of those companies.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nPrice will be under enormous pressure to reenergize the Republicans’ “repeal and replace” campaign that has stalled after encountering push back from insurers, health care providers, consumer advocates and even Republican governors and mayors.\n\nThat won’t be easy because many rank and file Republicans are being spooked by an intense backlash from liberal Democrats and progressive groups that are protesting efforts to dismantle Obamacare – including angry demonstrations at town hall meetings called by GOP lawmakers. In a few cases, Republicans skipped the meetings to avoid confrontation.\n\nPrice will also have to be careful in his dealings with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and a legion of committee chairs who have already begun discussing legislative options.\n\nYet his experience and depth of knowledge of complex health care issues undoubtedly will make him first among equals within the Trump administration in shaping policy on Obamacare as well as Medicare and Medicaid – two other programs that Price has long criticized as wasteful and ill-conceived.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions\n\n“I think he’s going to have a major influence on White House thinking,” said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, “because he is clearly going to be the most senior and most knowledgeable person all the way around on health care financing.”\n\nWhile Trump has shown little reluctance to speculate on the timing and scope of his ideas on replacing Obamacare – including his boast three weeks ago that a plan for providing insurance for “everyone” was imminent – Antos predicts that the president likely will take his cues from Price in the future. “I think that a lot of where the administration is going to come out on issues is going to originate with Tom Price, as opposed to it being top down, as it was in the Obama administration,” he said in an interview.\n\nPrice’s challenge in waging war on Obamacare is two-fold: One is to carry out Trump’s recent executive order that mandates agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service to do whatever they can “within the law” to mitigate any adverse effects of the Affordable Care Act on the insurance industry, health care services or consumers. The order has been widely interpreted as Trump’s call to begin the demolition of Obamacare from within, before Congress finally gets around to passing legislation. Price reportedly will begin rolling out some policy changes shortly.\n\nThe other challenge is to take a leading role in designing or perfecting Obamacare replacement legislation. In recent weeks, a number of Republicans have begun promoting replacement plans of their own, including one by Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that would essentially allow the states to decide whether to keep Obamacare or opt for some other health insurance system.\n\nRelated: GOP Cuts in Medicare May Be Next After Dismantling Obamacare\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky unveiled a more conservative system of tax credits and health savings accounts after privately conferring with Trump. And Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady of Texas, and Ryan are all weighing in with proposals of their own.\n\nFor his part, Price has spent years working on replacement ideas, and most recently unveiled a 242-page bill detailing a new conservative approach. That legislation, called the Empowering Patients First Act, would use a handful of tax credits, savings incentives, state grants and other marketing incentives to spark greater competition within the insurance industry and provide consumers with more policy choices, ideally at a lower cost.\n\nBut Price’s proposals for weaning more than 20 million Americans away from Obamacare are highly controversial among Republicans as well as Democrats. And critics have warned that any radical alternative like this would result in millions of Americans losing coverage.\n\nPrice, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon from suburban Atlanta who has spent much of his political career as a state legislator and House member railing against government intervention, is unmatched in his disdain for Obamacare and government regulations that he says intrude on the relationship between doctors and their patients.\n\nRelated: Congress Gives Trump a Chance to Recast the Federal Budget\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last month, Price declared that “we ought not go down the road” with anything that “gets in the way” of the patient, their families and physicians “making the decisions about what kind of health care they desire.”\n\nThe Tea Party conservative has embraced a number positions well outside of the mainstream of basic health care policy, as The Washington Post noted Thursday. Democrats say that they are even more alarmed that Price for years has advocated transforming Medicare from an open-ended entitlement for seniors to a fixed government contribution for beneficiaries to use to either purchase private insurance or continue with traditional Medicare.\n\nAlthough Trump pledged during the campaign to leave Medicare and Social Security alone, liberal groups and advocates for seniors now worry that Medicare could become a bargaining chip later this year, as Republicans look for ways to finance their health care initiatives and help pay for a massive tax cut.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York charged that Price had “dedicated his life to destroying Medicare as we know it” and that Price’s premium support approach would result in millions of seniors losing their health care coverage.\n\nMcConnell vigorously defended Price and his views, saying at one point that Price “knows more about health care policy than just about anyone.”"

    "text": "After being bested by Hillary Clinton in a primary contest that saw the deck stacked against him by the Clinton Machine, Bernie is back in the Senate doing what he has always done for the past 30-odd years – fighting a system rigged against blue-collar and middle-class America.\n\nRelated: It’s About to Get a Lot Easier to Sue Your Credit Card Company\n\nMeantime, the Improbable President has larded his Cabinet and cadre of counselors with bespoke denizens of the financial community – the very people he railed against – and is working to undermine protections put in place to give the voters who elected him a means to fight back against the banks and credit-card companies that gnaw at their paychecks.\n\nAs the Senate prepares to confirm the Treasury Secretary nomination of Steve Mnuchin—an ex-Goldman Sachs banker and financier who foreclosed on thousands of families, including active-duty troops, during the housing bust—Republicans are working to dismantle or neuter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nConservative knives are out for the CFPB, created after the financial crisis as an agency to rein in the excesses of the financial industry. The President who promised on Jan. 9, 2016, when he was campaigning in Iowa, “I'm not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We're going to tax Wall Street,\" seems to be fine with that.\n\nWhen The Daily Caller asked Press Secretary Sean Spicier, does the President intends to revamp the CFPB yesterday, Trump basically dodged the question. For the record, Barack Obama had 34 former employees from Goldman Sachs in his administration, including Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff; Stephen Friedman, Chair of Obama’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board; Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury; and Larry Summers, chief economic advisor.\n\nRelated: Yellen Sends a Message to Trump: Hands Off Dodd-Frank\n\nAs The New York Times reported yesterday, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling has a plan that would make it easier to replace the leadership of the CFPB and at the same time “limit the bureau’s enforcement authority, reduce its ability to make rules and repeal its consumer complaint system.”\n\nIn addition, The Times said that the plan contained in a leaked memo from Hensarling, once said to be under consideration for Treasury Secretary, called for legislation that “would also greatly shrink the enforcement tools at the consumer watchdog’s disposal, blocking it from being able to go after businesses engaged in deceptive practices and restricting its oversight of big publicly traded companies that are already regulated by agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.”\n\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Hensarling called the CFPB “the most destructive and dangerous of the new regulatory bureaucracies” created by the Obama Administration.\n\nOne of the dangerous and destructive acts of the CFPB was to join with the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office and Office of the Controller of the Currency in going after Wells Fargo for a scheme in which some 2 million bogus bank and credit-card accounts were opened without customers’ knowledge. (The regulators acted after a 2013 investigation by The Los Angeles Times.)\n\nWells Fargo paid $185 million in fines, including $100 million to the CFPB. Its CEO, John Stumpf was forced to resign. And a recent story in Politico says the bureau’s “enforcement of consumer-protection laws has returned $11.7 billion to people harmed by banks, credit card companies and mortgage companies.”\n\nThe Hensarling scheme to undercut the CFPB by making it easier for the President to replace the director, who now can be dismissed only for “cause,” isn’t the only right-wing effort to get rid of Richard Cordray, the agency’s first and only leader since it opened for business in 2012. Cordray has said he intends to complete his term, which ends in 2018.\n\nIn a pathetically chicken-something quest for evidence to use against Cordray, The Cause of Action Institute, a so-called government watchdog group, sent a letter to the CFPB director on Wednesday saying he may have violated the Federal Records Act by not saving text messages sent from his private phone to agency employees, The Hill reported.\n\nCause of Action, according to the Los Angeles Times, is backed by an arm of the billionaire Koch brothers’ vast political influence network. A 2015 story in The Times said, “Tax records show that by 2013, [Cause of Action’s] operations were mostly funded by $4.35 million from Donors Trust, a nonprofit group through which the Kochs and their allies distribute tens of millions of dollars without needing to disclose the sources of the funds.”\n\nThe Cause of Action website says the institute's vision is \"A society in which liberty and opportunity are fortified by a fair, accountable, limited, and transparent government.\"\n\nAsked about its backers, a spokesperson said in an email: \"We at Cause of Action Institute respect our donors’ anonymity and therefore we do not identify them.\"\n\nRelated: Elizabeth Warren Is Already Positioning Herself for 2020\n\nOne reason the GOP may be so hell-bent on taking the teeth out of the CFPB is that it is largely the creation of Senator Elizabeth Warren, the progressive firebrand from Massachusetts who promoted the notion of a voice for the little guy when she was a law professor at Harvard. She managed to get under Trump’s thin skin many times during the campaign and is fast-becoming the face of Democratic Party efforts to confront and confound his presidency.\n\nBernie Sanders, though, said it all on CNN last Sunday when he allowed that while he didn’t mean to be disrespectful, Trump is “a fraud.”\n\n“This guy ran for president of the United States saying, ‘I, Donald Trump, I’m going to take on Wall Street. These guys are getting away with murder.’ And then suddenly, he appoints all these billionaires.” Sanders told Jake Tapper. “His major financial adviser comes from Goldman Sachs. And now he is going to dismantle legislation that protects consumers.\"\n\nThe Cause of Action website says the institute's vision is \"A society in which liberty and opportunity are fortified by a fair, accountable, limited, and transparent government.\"\n\nAsked about its backers, a spokesperson said in an email: \"We at Cause of Action Institute respect our donors’ anonymity and therefore we do not identify them.\""

    "text": "Should the Republicans eventually make good on their threat to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, several million Americans being treated for opioid addiction and serious mental disorders likely would lose their Medicaid coverage, according to a new study.\n\nThe Medicaid program for low income adults and children, pregnant women and disabled people was substantially expanded under Obamacare in 32 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, hundreds of thousands of more low income adults with substance abuse problems gained coverage.\n\nRelated: US Death Rate From Heroin and Opioid Abuse Soars\n\nOverall, millions of people qualified for the first time for mental health and drug addiction treatment programs through expanded Medicaid, their employer health insurance or other private market plans, thanks to provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile the fate of the expanded Medicaid program is very much up in the air as President Trump and Republican congressional leaders struggle to come up with a replacement for Obamacare, a new study by the liberal leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warns that 4.1 million people are at risk of losing their mental health and drug addiction coverage.\n\nThose include 1.3 million people with serious mental illness and 2.8 million people with opioid and other substance abuse disorders. Health care economists Richard G. Frank and Sherry A. Glied prepared the estimates for the center.\n\nThe need for treatment of addiction to prescription drugs, heroin and other opioids couldn’t be greater.\n\nRelated: As Heroin Addiction Surges, Obama Orders New Treatments\n\nIn 2015, nearly 94 million people reported using illicit drugs, misusing prescription drugs or binge drinking, according to a report by the U.S. Surgeon General. The nationwide epidemic of opioid and heroin abuse, in up-scales suburban communities as well as urban areas, surfaced in the 2016 presidential campaign and was decried by President Trump.\n\nLast October in New Hampshire, Trump vowed to crack down on prescription drug abuse while offering help to those struggling with addiction. Specifically, he promised to “dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.”\n\nThere were a record 47,000 drug overdose deaths in 2014, with 29,000 or 61 percent, stemming from opioid use. Nineteen states in all regions of the country – especially West Virginia, Kentucky and New Hampshire -- saw a statistically significant increase in drug overdose deaths between 2014 and 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention..\n\nRelated: The Rapidly Rising Death Toll of the Heroin Epidemic\n\nEven more shocking, deaths from heroin overdoses rose by 23 percent in 2015 to 12,990, for the first time surpassing deaths from gun violence in the United States.\n\nAccording to the new report, the ACA, in tandem with the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addition Equity Act, made “huge advances in improving and ensuring treatment” for people with drug addiction problems. The changes in the law made treatment more available and less expensive. Also, young people who needed help could stay on their parent’s health plans up to age 26.\n\nWhat’s more, the new laws recognized that mental health and substance abuse treatments are just as important as physical conditions, and that it would be a mistake to impose more restrictions on the number of treatment sessions for these mental health disorders than for more typical visits to doctors and health care facilities.\n\nRepublican and Democratic governors alike have raised concern about losing expanded Medicaid coverage for their constituents if the Affordable Care Act is finally repealed – or if Congress converts the Medicaid program to federal block grants to the states. State and local government’s share of overall substance abuse treatment spending fell from 35 percent to 29 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the new report.\n\nRelated: The New War on Heroin Has Only Just Begun\n\n“ACA repeal would put pressure on states and localities to raise funding for substance use services, likely forcing them to stop paying for non-Medicaid eligible support services that assist in [substance abuse] recovery, such as housing and employment training,” the report said. “And states could no longer afford to test new models of treatment or recovery supports.”"

    "text": "Mexico now knows the size of the bill they’ll be receiving from the Trump administration for the border wall the president has promised to build -- and it’s a lot bigger than expected. A report completed by the Department of Homeland Security and leaked to the Reuters news agency on Thursday, pegs the cost of extending the existing barrier along the southern border at $21.6 billion, almost double the $12 billion figure that Trump floated during his presidential campaign.\n\nThe project would be completed in phases and would take some three and a half years, meaning that unless the project is started almost immediately, it would likely remain incomplete by the end of Trump’s first term in office.\n\nRelated: Here’s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves\n\nIn remarks to law enforcement officials in Washington on Wednesday, Trump reported that the wall was being designed “right now.”\n\nHowever, this week, DHS Secretary John Kelly told Congress that isn’t likely to happen, testifying only that construction would be “well under way” within two years. Kelly did restate the administration’s commitment to completing it, though, calling the border with Mexico a “gaping wound” in national security.\n\nThe wall, as a key element of Trump’s campaign for the Oval Office, has become a symbol of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration, and despite the cost and logistical difficulty of erecting it, is not something the president can afford to back away from.\n\nHe also cannot retreat on his repeated insistence that Mexico will pay for the construction, a promise that was largely viewed as a fantasy even before the cost of the construction was revealed to be far higher than Trump originally claimed.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq’s Oil\n\nThe fuss over payment for the wall has already led to one of several foreign policy missteps by the new administration, with a planned visit from the Mexican president being scrapped after Trump found himself in a Twitter-based war of words with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nIn an odd aside, prior to Trump’s decision to go after Pena Nieto on Twitter, the president had delivered a speech about Mexico that many saw as conciliatory. He said, “a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States — very, very good...I truly believe we can enhance the relation between our two nations to a degree not seen before, certainly in a very, very long time.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the language in Trump’s speech was tempered by his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, with an assist from Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who was in the White House prior to its delivery.\n\nIn a television appearance later that day, though, Pena Nieto restated his refusal to pay for the wall, leading Trump to suggest that the Mexican president should cancel his upcoming visit, which Pena Nieto promptly did."

    "text": "President Trump said all along he was going to go after the Iran nuclear pact—another of his “worst evers.” During his campaign, he promised more sanctions, a promise which he has now kept after Iran fired a ballistic missile test last month and then on Tuesday, fired a short-range surface-to-air missile from the same launch pad.\n\nIt’s fast work for Trump and Michael Flynn, who holds the Iran portfolio. “As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,” Trump’s national security adviser said just days after the missile was launched.\n\nRelated: Iran Vows 'Roaring Missiles' If Threatened, Defies New Sanctions\n\nNext, comes Trump’s demand to renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement, which was signed by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the US, United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China, plus Germany. Trump’s planned actions carry big risks; are they worth taking?\n\nSanctions. Treasury announced the new sanctions February 3, a few days after another of the ballistic missile tests Iran periodically conducts. They cover 12 companies and 13 people—some Iranian and some foreign, including one Chinese business executive. All are alleged to support, one way or another, Iran’s missile program or its Revolutionary Guards.\n\nIt’s a proven loser. The Obama administration failed repeatedly to include the missile tests as a violation of the nuclear deal. When that didn’t stick, Samantha Power, Obama’s U.N. ambassador, asserted that the tests breach an earlier Security Council resolution.\n\nThey do not in either case. The Trump White House is down to claiming the tests “violate the spirit” of the pact, but they don’t do that, either. As to the 2015 U.N. resolution, it covers missiles bearing nuclear warheads, and Iran’s could, but don’t. Bottom line: Washington’s sanctions will never deter the Iranians from providing for their own defense.\n\nRelated: Iran Confirms Missile Test, Drawing Tough Response from Trump Aide\n\nThe nuclear accord. It’s hard to negotiate when there’s no one across the table, and Tehran made it clear even before Trump’s inauguration that it has no intention of revisiting the terms of this agreement. Just as saliently, Trump and Flynn won’t have anyone on their side of the table, either. The P5 + 1 group is not even remotely considering a renegotiation.\n\nSpeaking in Tehran after the test last week, French foreign minister Jean–Marc Ayrault expressed “concern” about it, which is just above a shrug in diplomacy-speak. He then said, “We harbor real concerns about the U.S. administration’s attitude toward this agreement.”\n\nTrump and Flynn need a reality check before they go any further. Their running theme, “Iran should be grateful for the nuclear agreement,” is myopic and needlessly provocative. As Ayrault and others now signal, Trump and Flynn are taking some big gambles, even if they don’t yet realize it. And there’s nothing to gain and a lot to lose—which is a good definition of an unwise wager.\n\nDoes Washington truly want to alienate the reformists in Tehran who pushed the agreement through at considerable political cost? Were things better under the egregious Ahmadinejad regime? What about the Europeans who are weary of the sanctions regime and the post-pact hostility between Washington and Tehran? Can Trump afford to annoy the Continent more than he already has?\n\nRelated: Mattis Says U.S. Not Adding Troops Over Iran Concerns\n\nSince his telephone conversation with Vladimir Putin a couple of weeks ago, it’s clear that Trump is committed to his neo-détente policy toward Russia. Given Russia’s notable efforts to get the nuclear deal done, Trump should see the risk of shooting himself in the foot if he pushes too far on Iran.\n\nOn the GDP side, what’s going to happen to Boeing’s $16.6 billion deal, signed in December, to sell Iran Air 80 planes?\n\nHere’s the irony: While a redone deal is an obvious reversal of Obama’s policy, Trump and Flynn otherwise assume a variation of the policy the Obama administration handed them. This means they’re headed for the same kind of trouble Obama found and some new trouble of their own making.\n\nThe sanctions just implemented were drafted while Obama was still in office. As to the nuclear accord, Obama’s Treasury began to undermine it as soon as it was signed. If an administration wanted to reap as little benefit as it could from a deal it worked hard to strike, Barack Obama and John Kerry, his secretary of state, showed how to do it.\n\nTrump and his national security adviser should avoid making a variant of the same mistake.\n\nNo diplomatic settlement is ever perfect, but the Iran accord has plenty in it to Washington’s advantage. Iran accepted a significant infringement on its sovereign rights including inspections of unprecedented intrusion. And the Iranians are sticking to the terms, although the reformists who negotiated are now stuck in a battle they shouldn’t have to wage."

    "text": "Comments from industry insiders and a preliminary document leaked to the press suggest that the Trump administration’s passion for public-private partnerships may extend well beyond the new highways, bridges and airports the new president has been promising. So far beyond them, in fact, that there is talk of putting an astronaut back on the moon by the year 2020.\n\nOver the past year and a half, Trump has occasionally spoken about reinvigorating the US space program, which mothballed its space shuttle program years ago, and hasn’t replaced it with an operational program to send astronauts to the international space station, much less to engage in deep space exploration.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nHowever, in the absence of a strong government space program, a growing industry of small, private-sector corporations, including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Orbital and others, have rushed into the void, offering cargo services and satellite launch services.\n\nThe Trump administration apparently wants to capitalize on the enthusiasm for commercial spaceflight by reorienting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration toward the “the large-scale economic development of space.”\n\nThat’s the language contained in a draft proposal obtained by Politico this week. The proposal envisions a future of private space stations in orbit around the earth as well as a push to establish outposts on the moon and a push to explore Mars.\n\nPolitico reports that the plan, developed by a Trump administration transition team, aims to “see private American astronauts, on private spaceships, circling the Moon by 2020; and private lunar landers staking out de facto ‘property rights’ for [Americans] on the Moon, by 2020 as well.”\n\nRelated: Rural State Republicans Challenge Trump's Infrastructure Spending Plan\n\nThe move envisioned in the draft would sharply challenge the NASA business model that has, over the years, tended toward reliance on major defense contractors undertaking decades-long projects with major contractual protections.\n\nInstead, the government would force the “old space” companies to compete with industry newcomers in a results-based effort to sharply accelerate the development of new technologies. There may also be an effort afoot to create competition for the existing Space Launch System project, headed by Boeing, that is producing a huge “heavy-lift” rocket that would reach the moon and perhaps someday, Mars.\n\nHowever, Alan Stern, chairman of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation said this week that his members are less interested in horning in on an existing project as they are on what he described as synergies between their own technologies and those currently under development by NASA."

    "text": "The Marines want to get their hands on more F-35Bs – with a current cost of about $123 million each – at a faster rate than the current schedule calls for.\n\nThe Corps’s top aviator, Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, is quoted by Defense News as saying Wednesday: \"Bottom line is we've had a very anemic ramp, so we've been holding onto the older airplanes longer.” He said that if the Marines got the jets faster, “I guarantee we'd put them into play very, very quickly.”\n\nRelated: Is the F-35 Really Streaking by Its Troubled Past?\n\nDavis said that the Marines have an aging fleet of aircraft that in the light of budget cuts and spending delays is difficult to keep airborne. According to the Marine Times, Davis said that out of 1,065 aircraft, 439 – or less than 50 percent -- were operational as of Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nFrom fiscal 2018 through 2021, the Marines are scheduled to get 20 F-35Bs a year. Davis wants to jack that number up to about 37 Joint Strike Fighters a year.\n\nThe F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) version of the Joint Strike Fighter, designed specifically for the Marines. According to the new $8.5 billion contract between the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin, the Marine version of the F-35 costs $122.8 million apiece, though that figure is expected to drop as manufacturing efficiencies kick in. An additional 17 jets per year would cost a bit more than $2 billion at the current rate.\n\nOn Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, President Trump claimed credit for helping to bring down the cost of the F-35, saying the U.S. saved more than $600 million after he got involved in negotiations with Lockheed Martin. However, those savings may have been in the works before he took office.\n\nRelated: Air Force General Challenges Trump Over the F-35\n\nThe Marines are also looking to increase their numbers overall. In written testimony to Congress on Tuesday, Assistant Commandant Gen. Glenn Walters said the service needs to raise its fighting force to 194,000, the Marine Times said. The fiscal 2017 budget pushes up the troop level to 185,000 from 182,000, though that increase has not yet been funded.\n\nOne big plus the Marines may have in its favor as it seeks to gain strength: The Defense Department is now in the hands of a former four-star Marine general, James Mattis."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/09/Rural-State-Republicans-Challenge-Trump-s-Infrastructure-Spending-Plan",
    "text": "President Donald Trump swept to victory last November with overwhelming support from rural white voters across the country who eagerly responded to the billionaire businessman’s pledge to repair and modernize their roads, bridges, and airports and bring back jobs to their remote and sparsely populated communities.\n\nTrump promised to pump at least $1 trillion into new infrastructure projects in the coming years, or twice as much as his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, had promised to spend.\n\nRelated: Trump’s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag for Dems\n\nBut the outlines of his plan that first surfaced late in the campaign are proving highly controversial. And Republican lawmakers, policymakers, and state transportation officials from predominantly rural states and communities are bridling over a proposed financing mechanism that could largely freeze them out of most of the benefit.\n\nAlthough neither Trump nor his new Transportation Secretary, Elaine Cho, has formally embraced the approach, the plan is gaining widespread attention. As initially drafted, it calls for the use of new generous tax credits to attract private investors into public-private partnerships, instead of more traditional direct federal and state government spending on infrastructure.\n\nTrump boasted that under his approach, the federal government could avoid having to raise gas taxes or increase the deficit to pay for the new projects. However, a major caveat was that this new strategy could only succeed with projects that generate substantial revenue flows – such as toll bridges and toll roads or airport parking garages. While nearly 30 states collect tolls on roads, bridges and in tunnels, the majority of states that don’t are located in the West, including Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Oregon and New Mexico.\n\nDuring a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Wednesday, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming – the powerful Republican chairman and a member of the Senate GOP leadership -- complained that raising private investment for toll roads and bridges would do little to help his sprawling, sparsely populated state.\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nHe noted that members of his committee represent both urban and rural areas – from New York City and Newport, Rhode Island to Nebraska City, Nebraska, and Wheatland, Wyoming. “The diversity of these cities and towns make it clear: solutions to address and pay for fixing our nation’s crumbling roads, bridges and dams cannot be one-size-fits-all,” Barrasso said in his opening statement. “What works for Baltimore, Maryland, might not work for Baggs, Wyoming.”\n\n“Funding solutions that involve public-private partnerships, as have been discussed by administration officials, may be innovative solutions for crumbling inner cities, but do not work for rural areas,” he added.\n\nWilliam Panos, director of the Wyoming Department of Transportation, told the committee that public-private partnership ventures to repair or replace highways, roads, and bridges that depend on a steady revenue stream are not an adequate solution for rural America’s needs.\n\n“The traffic volumes on projects in rural states are low, and it’s almost never feasible from revenue generation,” he said in his remarks.\n\nRelated: Here’s Why It Will Be So Hard for Trump or Clinton to Rebuild America\n\nIn opposing the Trump approach, Panos spoke on behalf of transportation officials from Republican strongholds in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. He stressed the importance of maintaining robust transportation investments in rural communities that are essential to accommodating coast-to-coast truck transportation of agriculture and energy products, as well as providing public access to Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore and other scenic areas.\n\n“Our states face significant transportation funding challenges,” he said. “We can’t provide all these benefits to the nation and ensure a sufficiently connected national system without federal investment. We are geographically large; often include vast tracks of federal and tribal lands; have extensive highway networks; and have low population densities.”\n\nHe insisted that any Trump administration infrastructure initiative must continue to provide federal assistance to the states on a formula basis, which would assure them of a steady flow of government support, at least for surface transportation projects.\n\nStates and the federal government have struggled to meet the essential highway and bridge construction needs for years using an 18.4 cent-per-gallon federal gas tax that has not be raised since 1993. Congress for years has taken a patchwork approach to funding highway and mass transit projects through the federal Highway Trust Fund.\n\nRelated: As Roads Crumble, Infrastructure Spending Hits a 30-Year Low\n\nCongress enacted a $305 billion, five-year highway and mass transit bill in December 2015, financed by the gas tax and $70 billion of offsets from other areas of the federal budget. The legislation, signed by former President Barack Obama, marked the passage of the first long-term national transportation spending package in a decade.\n\nHowever, federal funding for infrastructure projects is woefully behind the need. The American Society of Civil Engineers, for example, says that the U.S. needs to invest $1.4 trillion in infrastructure between now and 2025 and $5.2 trillion by 2040.\n\nTrump and Clinton made new infrastructure construction – and the jobs it would generate – a major issue throughout the 2015 campaign. Trump bested Clinton by pledging new spending and doubled the $500 billion she originally proposed.\n\nThe outlines of Trump’s plan began to emerge late in the campaign, in the form of a ten-page white paper drafted by wealthy businessman Wilbur Ross, Trump’s nominee to be the next Commerce Secretary and conservative economics professor Peter Navarro, who has been tapped to head the National Trade Council.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Economic Plan: Spend Like a Democrat, Regulate Like a Republican\n\nThe plan essentially gives investors an 82 percent tax credit to plow money into new state and local government projects – so-called public-private partnerships -- that would obviate the need for the federal government to raise the gasoline tax, increase overall government spending and add to the deficit.\n\nRoss and Navarro portrayed the tax scheme as a win-win for the country. They argued that as little as $137 billion in new tax credits could be leveraged into $1 trillion of new infrastructure investments over ten years. And whatever tax dollars the Treasury would lose by granting the credits would be recaptured by federal income and business taxes on construction workers and contractors involved in the new projects.\n\nThe fly in the ointment, according to Barrasso and others, is that projects selected for this special tax treatment must be able to generate a revenue stream to help retire the bonded indebtedness. Tax credits may eventually become part of the overall infrastructure mix, depending on what the Republican-controlled Congress does later this year on tax reform. But many Democrats, economists and transportation experts warn that Trump’s approach could end up rewarding investors in projects that likely would have been built even without the credits."

    "text": "With each passing day since president Trump’s inauguration, whatever theoretical line may have existed between the new administration and the Trump family has become increasingly blurry. The point we’ve arrived at now is that the line is barely visible.\n\nThe president’s senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, used an appearance on Fox and Friends Thursday morning to specifically endorse a line of clothing and accessories sold by a company founded by the President’s Daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump Continues to Cash In on the Presidency\n\nConway, who appeared from the White House briefing room, was asked about the decision by Nordstrom, the department store chain, to stop carrying Ms. Trump’s products. The company said that the decision was based on the fact that the brand was not selling well.\n\nShe replied, “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would say. I hate shopping — I'm going to buy stuff today.” She continued, “It’s a wonderful line. I own some of it...I fully — I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”\n\nCritics were quick to point out that Conway appears to have violated at least the spirit of the federal law with the statement. The Code of Federal Regulations notes that federal employees, “shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise.”\n\nBut it has become clear that President Trump and his closest advisers no longer seem to care much about the niceties of federal conflict of interest laws. Clear, too, is that Trump’s advisors, and Trump himself, are placing the larger Trump family’s business interests under the protection of the White House’s bully pulpit.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nTrump on Wednesday used his personal Twitter account to blast Nordstrom for treating his daughter “unfairly.” He then used his official @POTUS account to retweet the criticism.\n\nFor its part, Nordstrom explained in a statement, “Over the past year and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.”\n\nIn a press briefing later that day, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked whether it was appropriate for the president to use his position to attack a private business for a decision involving his daughter.\n\n“I think this is less about his family's business and an attack on his daughter,” Spicer said. “He ran for president. He won. He's leading this country. I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Romance With Big Labor Is Headed for the Rocks\n\n“There’s a targeting of her brand and it’s her name,\" Spicer added in answer to a follow-up. “She’s not directly running the company. It’s still her name on it. There are clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father’s positions on particular policies that he’s taken. This is a direct attack on his policies and her name. Her because she is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies.”\n\nIn her appearance on Fox Thursday, Conway continued in that line, insisting that the Nordstrom decision was part of a broader attack on the Trump family by unspecified retailers. Conway claimed that she had seen “some executives all over the internet bragging about what they've done to her and her line,” though she offered no specifics.\n\nThe willingness of the Trump White House to send out government employees to defend a private business that profits a member of the Trump family -- and the president’s own decision to get involved -- has government ethics experts tied in knots.\n\nLarry Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center said in an appearance on CNN Wednesday, “He should not be promoting his daughter’s line, he should not be attacking a company that has business dealings with his daughter, and it just shows the massive amount of problems we have with his business holdings and his family’s business holdings.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/09/Trump-Has-Found-His-Alter-Ego-Attorney-General-Jeff-Sessions",
    "text": "The Senate’s vote to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General Wednesday night is a watershed moment for the new Trump administration, because the former Alabama senator is, far more than any of President Trump’s other nominees for key positions, in close agreement with the White House on issues where Trump has promised sweeping change to current policy.\n\nOther top cabinet positions have been filled with people whose loyalty and personal ties to Trump are not as ironclad as those of Sessions, the first senior Republican lawmaker to endorse the president at a time when Trump's candidacy was still viewed as a longshot at best.\n\nRelated: Americans Are Having Doubts About Trump’s Agenda: Poll\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon-Mobil played no substantial role in Trump’s campaign and comes to the office with few connections to the administration. James Mattis and John Kelly, the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, are both retired career military men who have spent much of their time in office so far trying to calm lawmakers and nervous allies who are unsettled by the rapid and unpredictable changes being implemented by the new White House.\n\nEven Neil Gorsuch, the federal judge tapped by Trump last week to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court, has demonstrated independence from the White House. On Wednesday, Trump had continued his attacks on other federal judges currently hearing the case against his ban on refugees and residents of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nIn a conversation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Gorsuch said that he found Trump’s comments “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” After Blumenthal made the comments public, a Republican member of the team shepherding Gorsuch through the confirmation process confirmed them to The Washington Post.\n\nThere is little reason to expect similar hesitation from Sessions, at least when it comes to implementing Trump’s priorities with regard to the strict enforcement of immigration law, the toughening of criminal justice system, and the extension of support to state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Fear Card as He Badgers Judges for Their Vote\n\nTo be clear, this is not because Sessions is a puppet of the new president. It is because he agrees with him.\n\nSessions jumped on the Trump train very early and even saw his top policy adviser, Stephen Miller, shift over to a key role with the Trump campaign. Miller was Sessions’ communications director, but the title underplays the importance of his role in helping Sessions and other conservative members of Congress develop policy positions on immigration and what Miller would call “nation-state populism.”\n\nIn an interview with Politico last summer, Miller described the role Sessions and his staff played in immigration debates on Capitol Hill, saying, “When I was in Sessions’ office, this movement for nation-state populism, the intellectual framework for that was being formed. ...We saw ourselves as a kind of think tank for immigration issues and linking that to the larger questions of globalism and populism.”\n\nUnlike the majority of Trump’s cabinet picks, who have little or no experience in the federal government, Sessions will arrive at the Justice Department with a wealth of it. He is a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and has spent 20 years in the United States Senate. While other nominees, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, are coming to grips with the realities of working for the federal government and trying to find the light switches, Sessions will be ready to move on day one.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nWhat that means is that the marching orders for US Attorneys across the country will be coming from an Attorney General who largely shares President Trump’s concern that immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, are a major threat to the physical safety and economic well-being of American citizens. It is a safe bet that prosecutorial resources will continue to be shifted sharply toward immigration-related enforcement.\n\nIt also means that state and local law enforcement can expect a sharp increase in support from the federal government. That will take the form of both closer cooperation and increased financial aid. The Attorney General has authority over a wide array of grant-making programs that support state and local police.\n\nHe also oversees the federal asset forfeiture program, which allows police to seize the assets of criminals and, in many cases, even of people who have not been convicted of a crime. The federal program allows the seizing agency to retain some or all of the property taken, a program that Trump has promised to support.\n\nIn sum, it seems likely that for the next four years, at least on President Trump’s signature law enforcement issues, there will be little daylight between the White House and the agency implementing them."

    "text": "Labor unions are, to put it kindly, not generally supportive of Republican politicians. There are exceptions of course, but Democrats historically have been seen as the party of workers and Republicans as the party of management. But on the Monday after he was sworn in, President Donald Trump made a show of meeting with top labor union leaders in the White House.\n\nReaching out to this traditional Democratic constituency was one of the more unconventional moves Trump made during a highly unconventional presidential campaign, and it won him a lot of unexpected support at the ballot box, even if it bore little fruit in terms of endorsements from labor leaders. However, by bringing them into the White House so early in his tenure, Trump signaled that he has an eye on union leaders’ future support.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes Aim at America’s Consumer Watchdog\n\nThere are definitely areas of overlap between Trump’s policies and those unions endorse. His withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal endeared him to some labor advocates, and his bullying of private companies that move jobs overseas has also been cheered by union officials.\n\nHowever, congressional Republicans are at the beginning of an effort that could seriously strain whatever bonds Trump has been able to build with the movement.\n\nLast week, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King introduced a bill that would make so-called “right-to-work” policy federal law. Right-to-work laws, which have been proliferating at the state level for years, generally hamper the ability of labor unions to organize by making it illegal for labor contracts to include a requirement that union dues be paid as a condition of employment. This week, Missouri became the 28th state to enact some form of right-to-work legislation.\n\nKing’s brief two-page bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), would strike language from the National Labor Relations Act and the more obscure Railway Labor Act in a way that would effectively implement right-to-work nationwide.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico Than He Saves\n\nWriting at The National Law Review, Garen E. Dodge and Anna M. Stancu, attorneys with the firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, note that this would likely mean the end of any meaningful labor movement in the U.S.\n\n“Organized labor in the United States has experienced a steady decline in the last several decades, from a peak union membership rate of 35% during the mid-1950s to 10.7% in the year 2016. For the private sector, the decline has been even more precipitous: a mere 6.4% of private sector workers in the U.S. were members of a union in 2016.”\n\nKing’s bill, they say, “would likely deal a crippling blow to already weakened organized labor in the U.S.”\n\nTrump has already gone on the record as a supporter of right-to-work legislation, and said as early as the Republican primary that he would sign a federal right-to-work bill into law if it reached his desk. But that was at a time when the idea of Trump winning the presidency was considered highly unlikely, and the idea of him doing so with Republican majorities in the House and Senate seemed laughable.\n\nRelated: Trump Continues to Cash In on the Presidency\n\nNow, things look a little more real, and last week White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer reiterated Trump’s position.\n\n“The president believes in right to work,” Spicer said. “He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what’s in the best interest for job creators.”\n\nWhether Republicans will be able to muscle a right-to-work bill through both houses of Congress is unclear, given the ability of Democrats to filibuster in the Senate. However, there are many endangered Senate Democrats running for reelection in states that are already in the right-to-work category who might be pressured to support it.\n\nIf it lands on Trump’s desk and he signs it, there would likely be no more cordial meetings between the president and labor leaders. But, given that in a right-to-work nation those leaders would see their influence greatly diminished, that might not matter to the president."

    "text": "House Democrats will gather this week in Baltimore to plan their strategy in the upcoming session of Congress – the first in ten years in which Democrats control none of the levers of Washington power. They chose “Fighting for All Americans” as their theme for this year’s conference, even as many Americans have abandoned the Democratic Party’s candidates over the last eight years. In some recognition of that, CBS News reports that they will discuss an “autopsy” of the 2016 election written under the direction of Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney.\n\nIt might be the first political self-autopsy for an organization that refuses to admit its own death – and especially its own culpability in it.\n\nRelated: Why Democrats Stuck With Nancy Pelosi Despite Their Election Drubbing\n\nEver since the election, Democrats have attacked the legitimacy of the election, its outcome, and its consequences. Pick a bête noire, and Democrats have blamed it for their loss in the presidential contest. They have argued that Russian hacks into the DNC’s e-mail system and subsequent release via WikiLeaks (sourcing that WikiLeaks disputes) amounted to foreign interference that made Donald Trump’s victory illegitimate. After that came a social panic about “fake news,” despite no evidence whatsoever that Facebook clicks or any type of page views for nonsensical news stories had any impact at all on voting behavior.\n\nAdd to that the strange insistence on citing popular-vote totals to argue that the Electoral College itself is illegitimate. Democrats have tried to argue that Trump should be denied some or all of the powers of the office because of a lack of “mandate,” a condition not found in the Constitution. What can be found in the Constitution is the Electoral College, the only way the US has elected its presidents for more than two centuries, and which Hillary Clinton managed to lose in what should have been a winnable election.\n\nAll of this ignores the depth and breadth of electoral losses by Democrats – not just in this last election cycle, and at every political level. Over the past eight years, Democrats have lost a net 11 Senate seats, 60 House seats, 14 gubernatorial seats, and almost a thousand seats in state legislatures. Thanks to the cyclical nature of Senate races, Democrats had a 23-10 advantage in this year’s upper chamber races and needed only five takeaways to clinch control of the Senate. They only picked up two and ended up shut out in the Republican return to single-party control. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump referred to this as “the Thelma and Louise-ing of the Democratic Party.”\n\nRelated: The Democrats' Desperate Russian Gambit Against Trump Will Backfire\n\nDemocrats have talked themselves into believing that joining “the resistance” will restore their relevancy. However, a new poll from Morning Consult and Politico suggests exactly the opposite. While 56 percent of Democrat voters want their party to pursue obstruction, majorities of most other major demographics want Democrats to cooperate with the new president and Republican-controlled Congress, including women, independent voters, all income and almost all age demos, urban voters, and even government employees.\n\nThat is precisely the kind of data that a proper autopsy would cover – if the party itself admitted its defeat wasn’t a fluke, but the culmination of years of disconnecting from voters across the country. Republicans managed to admit that much to themselves after their defeat in the 2012 presidential election, which allowed them to create a forward-looking plan for eventual victory. Trump’s triumph didn’t exactly fit that prescription, and the party still has a lot of work to do to fulfill the vision of the “Growth Opportunity Plan.” They learned enough to realize that they had lost touch with voters in the Rust Belt and key swing states, however, and put their resources into that outreach and organization.\n\nAn honest autopsy by Democrats would tell them much the same about their descent into the political wilderness. Rather than connect with voters, Democrats adopted the kind of top-down messaging and reliance on academic models that sunk Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. Instead of orienting their agenda to the real concerns of voters in much of America, Democrats have instead adopted an increasingly progressive agenda that prioritizes identity politics and uses that philosophy to lecture and condescend to voters.\n\nRelated: Democrats Will Regain Power If They Can Avoid Screwing Up\n\nThey continually woo celebrities to scold voters about latent bigotry (and take bizarre shots at the NFL and Mixed Martial Arts contests) rather than find messengers who can help Democrats craft an agenda that speaks to everyone equally. The map of Congressional districts in the US shows just how far that approach has marginalized them over the past eight years, now that the personal popularity of Barack Obama no longer masks the disconnect.\n\nWhy does this matter? If Democrats can’t accept reality, should we care? Yes, and we are seeing why now. For months, Democrats have remained stuck in the denial phase of the five stages of grief identified by Dr. Elizabeth Kübler-Ross. That denial generates powerful emotional connections to claims of injustice, a bedrock belief over the last three months that has driven protests, obstructionism, and downright lunacy in regard to all things Trump.\n\nDenial is driving Senate Democrats to quixotic lengths in attempting to block confirmation of Trump’s Cabinet nominations and creating overnight sessions that only highlight their inability to have any impact on the process at all other than temporarily stringing it out. In the meantime, Democrats have held up the process longer than for any other first-term president, delaying the inevitable – but also delaying the process of transition and creating confusion along the way.\n\nThe denial of Democrats threatens to derail the credibility of self-governance, ironically fulfilling a warning Democrats repeatedly made when they assumed Republicans would end up on the losing end of the election. Only after Democrats admit that the patient is actually dead can an autopsy help. The election is over – and it’s time for everyone to get back to work."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/08/Americans-Are-Having-Doubts-About-Trump-s-Agenda-Poll",
    "text": "President Trump and his aides frequently invoke the will of the voters in advancing his hard-edged conservative agenda, from dismantling the Affordable Care Act and stripping away onerous government regulations to retreating on climate change and banning immigrants from seven terrorism prone countries.\n\nBut a new Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday tells a different story. Just a few tumultuous weeks into the Trump presidency, a majority of Americans sharply disagree with him on many key elements of policy.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Fear Card as He Badgers Judges for Their Vote\n\n“A litany of calls to ‘hold your horses, Mr. President,’” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement summing up the findings. “Americans want President Donald Trump to keep the regulatory reins on business, and voters call for a full stop to laying new pipelines full of oil. They are against taking the knife to Obamacare and opposed to lifting environmental regulations.”\n\nAccording to the poll, a majority of voters surveyed nationwide (49 percent to 39 percent) are opposed to Trump’s promise to gut Dodd-Frank and other regulations governing Wall Street and businesses. And they say the new president should not decimate regulations and agreements designed to combat climate change, by a two to one margin.\n\nIndeed, 72 percent of the voters surveyed said they were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” about the problem of global warming, which Trump once dismissed as a hoax perpetrated by China. Just 17 percent of voters believe the U.S. is doing enough to address the problem, while 59 percent say that “more needs to be done.”\n\nMoreover, 50 percent of Americans don’t want Trump and his GOP allies to repeal and replace Obamacare, which has provided health insurance coverage to more than 20 million people. Not surprisingly, the issue sharply divides the two parties. Eighty-six percent of Democrats are opposed to repealing President Barack Obama’s signature program, while just 10 percent of Republicans want to see Obamacare survive.\n\nAmericans also generally oppose Trump’s plan to build a wall along the southern border, particularly if U.S. taxpayers get stuck with the bill: 63 percent oppose an American taxpayer-funded wall, compared to 35 percent who support it.\n\nRelated: Defying the Best Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nTo be sure, the results aren’t all negative: By a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent, the public supports Trump’s plan to renegotiate NAFTA and other international trade agreements. They overwhelmingly support the president’s idea for investing $1 trillion in roads, bridges and other infrastructure. And they heartily approve of his choice of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBut voters are wary of Trump’s emerging global posture, including his complaints that not all European allies are spending their fair share on defense. Americans maintain, 79 percent to 13 percent, that Trump and U.S. forces should defend all of this country’s NATO allies.\n\nMany Americans appear dismayed by Trump’s insistence that he won the November election over Democrat Hillary Clinton despite widespread voter fraud. By 61 percent to 28 percent, voters say they don’t believe Trump’s assertion that three million to five million non-citizens voted in the 2016 election.\n\nThe poll didn’t question voters about their stand on Trump’s controversial executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. That order triggered days of chaos and confusions in airports throughout the world and has been put on hold pending ruling by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A separate poll by Morning Consult and Politico shows public support for the president – 55 percent to 38 percent, although support appears to be slipping.\n\nRelated: Here’s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll was conducted from Feb. 2 to 6 and involved interviews with 1,155 voters nationwide; it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/08/Sanders-Charges-Big-PhRMA-Owns-United-States-Congress",
    "text": "The White House and key Democrats and Republicans turned up the heat again on Big PhRMA on Tuesday, lashing out at soaring prescription prices and vowing to press for measures to lower Medicare’s staggering drug costs and encourage greater competition among drug manufacturers.\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s commitment to lifting a legislative ban on Medicare negotiating lower drug prices with major pharmaceutical companies -- as does Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, and other government health care agencies -- White House spokesman Sean Spicer said yesterday, “He’s for it, yes.”\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\n“The easier way to look at this is to look at what other countries have done: Negotiating costs to keep those down,” Spicer said during a White House press briefing. He said the mounting costs of health care and prescription drugs are a “huge burden” on seniors in the Medicare program and must be addressed.\n\nTrump has sent mixed signals on whether he would support direct government intervention to lower health care costs, even as he has repeatedly complained about “astronomical” and unjustifiable surges in drug prices. Spicer’s comments temporarily drove down biotech stock prices and rekindled industry speculation over whether the new administration would come down hard on drug manufacturers.\n\nYesterday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the most liberal members of Congress, and arch-conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, seemingly joined forces during the town hall meeting to denounce the drug industry’s pricing practices and agreed to support two major initiatives: to lift the prohibition on Medicare bargaining for lower prices and to authorize consumers and drug distributors to acquire cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\nSanders, who promoted these and other ideas for reining in drug prices during his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered a scathing critique of the highly profitable drug industry and its top executives. He also took to task Senate and House members who over the years did nothing to address the drug price crisis.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n“Just as the case with healthcare, we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said. “What’s going on is that the pharmaceutical industry owns the United States Congress. I would admit it’s not just Republicans. They have a huge influence over the Democratic party as well.”\n\n“So right now, the reality is that uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to your pharmacy, and the cost that you pay is double or triple [what it is elsewhere], and there is nothing that anybody can do about it,” he said.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been among the biggest political spenders for years. They've traditionally supported Republican candidates, as they have received 64 percent of industry contributions on average since the 1990 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog research organization. Until now, drug lobbyists led by PhRMA have succeeded in blocking measures that threatened to cost them billions of dollars of annual profits.\n\nCruz, who differs sharply with Sanders over GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, said the two are in agreement on measures for increasing price competition and opening the borders to the importation of less expensive drugs. However, he voiced strong support that the Food and Drug Administration speed up the agency’s review of new drug applications – especially drugs for the treatment of seriously ill adults and children.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\n“I would love for us to work together going after big PhRMA, and in particular taking on the FDA,” Cruz told Sanders. “Right now it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug. . . There is story after story after story of life-saving drugs that are available, that are approved, they are used in Europe, they are used in Canada, and the FDA won’t allow it.”\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. In some cases, pharmaceutical companies have jacked up their prices by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs. Medicare, which covers 55 million Americans, spends $1 of every $6 on prescription drugs, or an estimated $95.1 billion in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nLess than two weeks into his administration, Trump on Jan. 21 summoned the heads of a half-dozen top drug manufacturers to the White House for the first round of talks after complaining that the pharmaceutical industry was “getting away with murder” by gouging consumers and the government.\n\n“We have to get the prices way down,” Trump told the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group. \"We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.”\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nTrump had offered a number of measures for containing drug prices, including the importation of cheaper drugs and allowing Medicare to begin negotiating drug prices. At the behest of drug manufacturers, Congress included the Medicare non-negotiation ban in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation. That prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits.\n\nPhRMA and its long-time allies on Capitol Hill have fought for years to preserve that ban on negotiating drug prices for the national health care program for seniors and opening the borders to cheaper drugs from abroad. They are digging in again to block efforts to repeal the restrictions.\n\n“Broadly, both of these proposals are concerning given the consequences for patients, both Medicare beneficiaries and consumers generally, said Allyson Funk, a spokesperson for PhRMA.\n\nFunk insisted in an email that “It is a common myth that there is no negotiation in Medicare Part D,” the prescription drug program for seniors. She said that “large, powerful purchasers” like Express Scripts have negotiated deep discounts and rebates directly with drug manufacturers, bypassing the Department of Health and Human Services and “saving money for both beneficiaries and taxpayers.\n\nShe also said that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has said on multiple occasions that the secretary of health and human services would not be able to negotiate lower prices than exist now “without restricting access to medicine for beneficiaries.”\n\nRelated: Trump pushes drugmakers for lower prices, more U.S. production\n\nAs for the drive to allow the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries, Funk said the importation of unapproved and potentially counterfeit medicine, “jeopardizes the secure medicine system in the United States and presents a serious risk to public health.”\n\nPhRMA did not directly respond to Sanders’ claim that the powerful lobbying group with deep pockets has effectively co-opted congressional Republicans and Democrats in the past to block unwanted legislation. But experts on campaign spending and lobbying say there is no question PhRMA wields a big stick.\n\n“The pharmaceutical industry is indisputably one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington,” said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the center. “It spent tens of millions on campaign donations and hundreds of millions on lobbying last cycle, which helped open doors on Capitol Hill for their army of 1,400 lobbyists. All that money is a pittance compared with the industry profits it helped produce, but means consumers shoulder higher costs than they would otherwise.”"

The F-35 achieved this remarkable ratio in a drastically increased threat environment that included radar jamming, increased air threats, and surface-to-air missile batteries.\n\nRelated: Is the F-35 Really Streaking by Its Troubled Past?\n\n\"In the past, the non-kinetic effects were not fully integrated into the kinetic fight,\" Col. Robert Cole, the Air Force Cyber Forward director, said in a statement.\n\nBut now F-35s take on cyberthreats and electronic warfare in addition to enemy surveillance and conventional, or kinetic, threats.\n\n\"This integration in an exercise environment allows our planners and warfighters to understand how to best integrate these, learn their capabilities and limitations, and become ready to use [these combined resources for maximum] effect against our adversaries,\" Cole said.\n\nBut the F-35s didn't just shoot down the enemy — they used their sensor-fusion and data link abilities to talk to other planes and help them sniff out threats they wouldn't have seen on their own.\n\nRelated: The F-35 Just Aced a Big Test -- and Became Much More Dangerous\n\n\"Before, where we would have one advanced threat and we would put everything we had — F-16s, F-15s, F-18s, missiles, we would shoot everything we had at that one threat just to take it out — now we are seeing three or four of those threats at a time,\" Lt. Col. George Watkins, 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told Aviation Week.\n\n\"Just between [the F-35] and the [F-22] Raptor, we are able to geolocate them, precision-target them, and then we are able to bring the fourth-generation assets in behind us after those threats are neutralized,\" Watkins said. \"It's a whole different world out there for us now.\"\n\nThe ability of fifth-generation US aircraft to detect threats and send that information to legacy planes meets an urgent need for the US military.\n\nAs adversarial nations like China and Russia improve their counter-stealth abilities and air defenses, numbers increasingly matter.\n\nThe F-35 repeatedly hit cost and schedule overruns during its production and is now years behind schedule.

    "text": "Donald Trump on Wednesday continued what increasingly looks like a campaign of intimidation against federal judges, as the legality of his executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States is debated in the courts.\n\nThe attacks began last week, when a federal judge in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the administration from enforcing the travel ban until the courts could reach a decision on whether it complies with the law. The basic conflict appears to be between federal law that prohibits using a person’s national origin as a criteria for blocking entry into the country and a separate statute that gives the president the authority to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”\n\nRelated: Defying the Best Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nTrump attacked Seattle Judge James Robart last week, predicting “death and destruction” if his order is not obeyed. He urged people to hold the court system in general and Robart in particular responsible for putting the country at risk of a terrorist attack.\n\n“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” Trump tweeted. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!”\n\nTrump’s attack on the judiciary raised alarm among legal experts. On Monday, American Bar Association President Linda A. Klein said, “It is vital that our judiciary remains independent and free from political pressure—independent from party politics, independent from Congress and independent from the president of the United States himself.”\n\nBut Trump has shown little concern about the appearance that he is pushing against the boundaries of the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of the government.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be the First Test Case for His Own Supreme Court Nominee\n\nOn Wednesday, even as a three-judge appeals court panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was in the process of deciding whether or not to leave Robart’s ruling in place, Trump appeared at a gathering of law enforcement officials in Washington to attack the process. He called the arguments against his executive order “disgraceful” and continued to suggest that if the courts do not rule in his favor, they should be seen as placing the country in danger.\n\nTrump showed up at the event with about 15 minutes’ worth of prepared remarks, but spoke for more than 25 minutes because the first part of his appearance was dedicated to a free-associative riff on the case.\n\nTrump brought a copy of the section of the U.S. Code that, he believes, gives him the authority claimed in the executive order, and he read part of it out loud. He then began to address the oral arguments in the case, which were carried live on some news programs Tuesday evening.\n\n“If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court they’d do what they should be doing,” he said. “It’s so sad when you read something so simple ... so perfectly written and so clear to anybody and then you have lawyers and I watched last night in amazement and I heard things that I couldn’t believe. Things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.”\n\nRelated: Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump\n\nHe continued, “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, and I won’t call it biased and we haven’t had a decision yet but courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right and that had to do with the security of our country which is so important. Right now we are at risk because of what happened.”\n\nTrump defended his own reading of the law, adding, “I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful.”\n\nHe added, “I think it’s sad. It’s a sad day. Our security is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country as chiefs as sheriffs of this country. We want security. One of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security.”\n\nIn an op-ed published Wednesday, before Trump’s most recent discussion of the case, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said the president’s “intimidating and threatening missives attacking the judiciary, and his personal invective and insults raise core constitutional dangers.”\n\nRelated: Here’s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves\n\nBut the president’s assaults on the independence of the judiciary are, so far at least, not raising much alarm among the Republicans running both houses of Congress. Asked about Trump’s behavior on Tuesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said “Look, I know he’s an unconventional president ... He gets frustrated with judges, we get frustrated with judges. But he’s respecting the process, and that’s what counts at the end of the day.”\n\nTrump, he added, “is honoring the ruling.”\n\nIf it seems strange that the speaker of the house is praising the president of the United States for not openly defying the ruling of a federal judge, well, that’s where we are today."

    "text": "The debut of the Trump administration has left Americans with major questions about the country's position on numerous issues of world-historical importance: Russian aggression, the ongoing refugee crisis in the Middle East, leadership on issues of international trade and climate change to name just a few.\n\nBut it’s becoming increasingly clear that there are other more pedestrian questions that are going to be extremely hard to avoid in this unprecedented presidency. A few:\n\nRelated: Here’s Why Trump May Be Sending More Jobs to Mexico than He Saves\n\nShould the president of the United States double as the Pentagon’s landlord? Should the first lady of the United States view the position as an unparalleled opportunity to promote her personal fashion businesses? Should the U.S. General Services Administration be negotiating the terms of a decades-long multi-million dollar building lease with the president’s son?\n\nThe refusal of President Trump to divest his ownership of the Trump Organization and the larger Trump family’s extensive efforts to turn their own personal “brands” into money-making opportunities continues to create extraordinary conflicts of interest.\n\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the Defense Department is now actively considering whether or not it should rent office space in Trump Tower in Manhattan. President Trump’s wife Melania and young son Barron still live there, and the president has indicated that he would like to spend some time there as well as in the White House.\n\nWith the Secret Service already occupying space in the building (and the city of New York spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every day to protect it), the U.S. military is now trying to decide if it, too, needs to rent offices from Trump’s personal business.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Hands Trump a $30 Billion Wartime Arms Wish List\n\n“In order to meet official mission requirements, the Department of Defense is working through appropriate channels and in accordance with all applicable legal requirements in order to acquire a limited amount of leased space in Trump Tower,” a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement to The Times.\n\nThat news comes just a day after lawyers representing Mrs. Trump in a libel lawsuit against the British Daily Mail newspaper outlined what appear to be plans to cash in on her position as first lady in a court filing. The lawsuit alleges that Mrs. Trump has been harmed by a false claim that she once worked as an escort, a claim since retracted by the newspaper.\n\n“Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model and brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skincare, and fragrance.”\n\nRepresentatives for Mrs. Trump immediately claimed, despite the plain language of her lawyers’ court filing, that the first lady has no plans to profit from her position, claiming “Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.” Defenders of Mrs. Trump argued that in order to press her case successfully, she needs to demonstrate that the false allegations caused her actual harm, and that the language in the lawsuit is designed to do that.\n\nRelated: Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump\n\nAs all this was going on, President Trump signed over management responsibility for the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The building is owned by the federal government and is currently leased to the Trump Organization in an arrangement with the General Services Administration.\n\nThe lease contains very specific language stating that no person who holds a position of authority in the federal government may also benefit from the hotel’s operating agreement with the government. Last week, ProPublica uncovered a document showing that Trump had placed his ownership stake in the hotel into a trust operated by his son. Crucially, Trump still owns his interest in the hotel and stands to profit from it, but will not actively engage in management.\n\nThis puts the GSA, whose managers literally work for Trump, in the position of negotiating with the president’s eldest son about the future of a lease that directly benefits the president himself.\n\nThe situation is giving government ethics experts fits. Former Obama administration ethics lawyer Norm Eisen publicly insisted that Trump, from the moment he took the oath of office, has been in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. But Trump and his family seem unconcerned.\n\nRelated: 12 Facts We Now Know About President Trump\n\nIndeed, the lack of concern about appearances and conflicts is evident in the White House itself, where Trump’s daughter Ivanka is now attending high-level meetings of economic policymakers despite the fact that she has extensive business interests of her own, and has yet to demonstrate that she has, as promised, removed herself from the management of Trump Organization.\n\nAt this point, the enrichment of the Trump family by and in conjunction with multiple agencies of the federal government isn’t something that can be avoided. It is already happening, and there seems to be nothing that will stop it. Certainly, the Republicans running the House and Senate, who have oversight authority over those agencies, have signaled that they have no interest in doing anything about it.\n\nBut it’s still important to keep pointing out that while top political leaders and their families in many countries around world routinely cash in on their positions, this is not acceptable in the United States."

    "text": "Nancy Pelosi says President Trump’s call to reshape Dodd-Frank is a “massive con” and that he is putting #WallStreetFirst. Sadly, she has set the tone for Congressional Democrats, siding with Elizabeth Warren progressives who hate Wall Street bankers and absolutely loathe Donald Trump.\n\nGiven the toxic political climate, Congress is unlikely to produce a much-needed overhaul of Dodd-Frank. Not only would it be a heavy and politically difficult lift for Republicans, but they also have other priorities, including reforming the collapsing Obamacare healthcare program and our dysfunctional tax system.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama’s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nBut here’s a hard truth for the Pelosi-Warren camp: it may not require rewriting Dodd-Frank to soften bank regulation. Having pushed through a bill long on pages (now above 20,000) and short on specifics, financial overseers have had considerable discretion in enforcing vague rules.\n\nMany in the banking industry complain that the law’s interpreters have been too tough, driven by a political agenda that has hurt the economy. Depending on his picks to head up key posts, Trump can quickly turn that tide. As former Congressman Barney Frank said last November on CNBC, the “main thing [Trump] can do to downplay regulation is appoint regulators who won’t regulate.”\n\nThat may already be happening. According to some in the financial industry, bankers have detected in recent weeks a more reasonable tone in dealing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The relief is welcome, and more is to come.\n\nWhy should we care? Because the financial industry greases the economic skids. Many blame the past several years’ sub-par growth partly on a lack of risk-taking and lending in the banking sector.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Golden Opportunity: Slashing 179,000 Pages of Federal Regulations\n\nWhat do bankers want? They want more control over how they manage their businesses and fewer quixotic compliance mandates. They complain that they are spending too much time and money trying to meet arbitrary and changeable rules set down by regulators instead of growing their businesses. They say, for instance, the determination of what constitutes a “systemically important financial institution” is capricious, much like the $10 billion asset threshold for intensive oversight.\n\nBanks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on “stress-testing” and preparing complex “living wills” that most consider a useless academic exercise. They say that the regulators’ inconsistent determination of how banks can meet heightened capital requirements has led many to harbor resources instead of making loans which might spur growth.\n\nThe six biggest banks, for example, have accumulated more than $100 billion in excess capital, money beyond that required to meet regulators’ demands; they want the freedom to pay dividends or buy back shares, activities governed by the Fed.\n\nPam Perdue writes in The Hill, “…since January 2013, banks and credit unions alone have dealt with 1,207 new rules spanning 53,486 pages in the Federal Register.” Those figures come from the Banking Compliance Index, which measures the “incremental cost burden on financial institutions.” In the last quarter alone, according to this measure, banks faced new 6,057 pages outlining 115 new rules, requiring 809 hours of compliance per institution, at a cost of more than $53,000 per bank.\n\nRelated: An Economic Agenda for Disruptor Trump\n\nThat might not sound dire, except that a study by the Minneapolis Fed showed that adding just two compliance personnel would make one-third of all small banks unprofitable. Since half of all small business loans come from banks with under $10 billion in assets, the sector is vital to an expanding economy. Between 2010 and 2015 the number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank by 14 percent; many blame regulatory excess.\n\nIn President Trump’s February 3rd executive order he asked for a review of financial regulation and laid down core principles for banking rules. He did not, for the record, command the “dismantling” of Dodd-Frank, as the liberal media has reported. He kept key tenets of the bill, such as banning the use of taxpayer money to bail out failed banks. His appointees to various agencies will be charged with implementing his guidelines, which stress, for instance, fostering “economic growth and vibrant financial markets” and enabling “American companies to be competitive with foreign firms.”\n\nImportantly, Trump has the opportunity to immediately nominate a vice chairman of supervision at the Fed, a post that was created through Dodd-Frank but never filled by President Obama. Former Treasury official and GE executive David Nason is a leading candidate for the position, a choice that bankers would welcome. Nason runs GE’s Energy Financial Services division and would bring a desirable level of real-world experience to the Fed office. Currently, nearly every person in the supervisory office is an economist, many of whom appear to have been hired straight out of graduate school.\n\nRelated: U.S. Banks Gear Up to Fight Dodd-Frank Act's Volcker Rule\n\nTrump can also fill two vacant Fed chairs right away with candidates not hostile to the financial sector. Also, most expect the resignation of Fed Board member Daniel Tarullo who has acted as a banking supervisor and is known for his harsh take on regulation and capital requirements.\n\nJanet Yellen’s term on the Fed runs until 2024, but she is expected to step down when her chairmanship ends early next year. Likewise, Vice Chair Stanley Fisher will likely leave in of July 2018. Consequently, Trump may well be in a position to fill five of seven fed seats over the next year and a half.\n\nBoth the head of the OCC and the FDIC are expected to vacate their posts this year. The remaining key regulator is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Chief Richard Cordray. His tenure will be determined by the courts which will decide whether the crafting of his position was unconstitutional, as a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has claimed.\n\nIn short, over the next several months Trump can replace many key officials that have overseen the banking sector in recent years and appoint more business-friendly individuals who agree with his call for rolling back excessive regulation. With Democrats behaving in full spoiler mode, that may be the best we can hope for."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/07/Conservatives-Are-Impatient-Trump-s-Slow-Repeal-Obamacare",
    "text": "With conservatives clamoring for quick action on dismantling and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the White House on Tuesday sought to reassure supporters that President Trump and congressional Republicans were still on track to complete work on legislation before the end of the year.\n\nBut White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was less than reassuring, saying that repeal might happen sooner than later, but that “implementation of the pieces may take a little bit longer.”\n\n“What we’re focused on is the end solution,” Spicer told reporters this afternoon. “And I think we have been very clear over and over again that the President is going to repeal and replace it, and that what Americans will get at the end of it is a health care solution that . . . is going to give them a lower cost health solution with more options.”\n\nRelated: The GOP’s ‘Repeal and Replace’ Obamacare Is Becoming ‘Repair and Fix’\n\nTrump on Sunday touched off an alarm bell among his conservative allies by suggesting in an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News that the task of repealing and replacing the national health insurance program was proving to be far more complicated and difficult than he originally assumed – and that congressional action could spill over into 2018.\n\nThe president campaigned on a pledge of eviscerating Obamacare, boasted at a post-election press conference that Congress would act to repeal and replace the insurance program almost simultaneously, and then told The Washington Post more than two weeks ago that he would unveil a comprehensive replacement plan that would cover “everybody” within days.\n\nBut over the weekend he was noncommittal when asked by O’Reilly whether Americans can expect Obamacare to be replaced within the calendar year. \"I would like to say, by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Republican president also noted that the process is “very complicated” – but then urged Americans to remember that “Obamacare is a disaster” and needs to be replaced. The national health insurance program, while troubled from the start, has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans and provides protection for older people and those with preexisting medical problems from discrimination by insurers.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nBut the 10 million people or so using the Healthcare exchanges have seen double-digit premium increases and untenable deductibles. The popular silver plan caps out of pocket costs for a family at $12,270; $6,110 for an individual. Perhaps more important to the average taxpayer: Obamacare would cost taxpayers $1.34 trillion over the next ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office. Last year alone, the program cost $110 billion.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), arguably one of the most ardent proponents of toppling Obamacare, told reporters Tuesday morning that he still intends to pass legislation to supplant Obamacare this year. While Ryan has become highly cautious about contradicting the bellicose president, he said that Trump’s weekend comments have done nothing to alter his ambitious timeline.\n\n“We are going to be done legislating with respect to health care and Obamacare this year,” Ryan said. But he, too, offered the caveat that it could take time for the new Trump administration to implement the changes.\n\n“The question about how long it takes to effectuate the change, how long it takes to put these things in place, that’s a question that the [Department of Health and Human Services’ can answer, he said.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nRyan insisted that he and other Republican leaders have already carefully designed numerous elements of a replacement plan. However, it’s the worst kept secret in Washington that the Republicans are still lightyears away from a consensus on how to stitch an overall plan together and push it through Congress. The Republicans already have missed a Jan. 28 deadline for acting on a budget resolution designed to repeal key components of Obamacare – an essential first step in ultimately replacing the program.\n\nAnd a number of more moderate senior Republicans, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, have advised slowing down the process and considering ways to “repair” Obamacare instead of replacing it.\n\nWith some GOP lawmakers literally skipping town hall meetings in their districts for fear of being pummeled with questions from constituents fearful of losing their health insurance, the air appears to be going out of the balloon of the “repeal and replace” movement on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut many conservatives are voicing frustration with Ryan and Trump about the slow pace and are demanding stepped up action to fulfill their party’s campaign pledge to voters.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Plan for Medicaid Could Be a Bad Deal for the States\n\nDan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action for America, told the New York Times yesterday that the political uncertainty around Obamacare repeal is mounting. “If the House has not passed a repeal bill and sent it to the Senate by mid-March, that would be serious cause for concern,” he said.\n\nConservative Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the current and former chairs of the House Freedom Caucus, issued a statement last Thursday demanding a vote on a repeal bill “as soon as possible.”\n\n“Health care will be better and more affordable once Obamacare is repealed,” they wrote. “We committed to the American people to repeal every tax, every mandate, the regulations, and to defund Planned Parenthood. That’s what the American people expect us to do – and they expect us to do it quickly.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/07/Why-GOP-Plan-Medicaid-Could-Be-Bad-Deal-States",
    "text": "Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are trying to drum up support for a controversial plan to transform the Medicaid program from a health care entitlement for the poor and disabled to a series of block grants to the states.\n\nThe idea is to save the federal government billions of dollars in the coming years while giving state officials more flexibility to set eligibility requirements and spending levels. Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, recently told NBC News that the change would shift spending decisions away from Washington to state officials “who are closest to those in needs” and best equipped to root out fraud and waste.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nHealth care policy experts have repeatedly cautioned that the Republicans’ Medicaid overhaul proposals would end up being a much better deal for the federal government than for the states. And a new study by Avalere Health, the health care consulting group, convincingly documents the extent of that disparity.\n\nThe analysis released Monday shows that the federal government would save an estimated $150 billion over the coming five years under a new block-grant approach, or $110 billion under an alternative scheme in which the federal government provides payments on a per capita basis.\n\nWhile state officials would have far more latitude to run the new Medicaid program and set policy with block grants, practically every state and the District of Columbia would suffer funding losses. Those losses would range from as little as 4 percent in Wisconsin to 62 percent in Arizona.\n\nIf Congress opted for a Medicaid per capita model, 24 states would receive an increase in federal funds, while the remaining 26 state and D.C. would suffer losses of up to 30 percent.\n\nRelated: Tom Price’s Big Claim: People Won’t Get Shafted on Health Care\n\nA block grant as conceived by House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and other GOP leaders would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade.\n\nCurrently, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states’ Medicaid costs — on average 57 percent — and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nCapping federal funding is popular among Republicans on Capitol Hill, and the Republicans would let states choose whether they wanted to receive a block grant or a per-capita allotment.\n\nUnder a Medicaid per capita approach, the federal government would set a limit on how much to reimburse states per enrollee, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. While block grants provide a set amount of federal spending regardless of enrollment, per capita payments to states would reflect changes in enrollment.\n\nA per capita approach would not take into account changes in the costs for each enrollee beyond an established cost growth limit. In order to save money, the federal government would set per capita growth amounts below the projected rates of growth under existing law. That would put a squeeze on the states and force them to find savings, reduce their rolls, or limit their services.\n\nThe Republicans have promoted these ideas as part of their larger effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The proposals face staunch opposition from Democrats, liberal advocacy organization and seniors’ groups including the AARP, which wrote a letter to lawmakers last week opposing both block grants and per capita caps.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\n“The Medicaid block grant model is more limiting to states because it constrains both spending growth and enrollment growth,” Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, said in a statement accompanying the new study. “The per capita cap model allows for greater flexibility and better absorbs marketplace fluctuations like financial downturns; however, it can still result in an overall loss of federal funding for state Medicaid programs.”\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law today covers about 81 million people, including poor children and pregnant women, the disabled and poor older people. Republicans have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste, and GOP efforts to convert Medicaid from a federal entitlement covering all eligible people to block grants to the states dates back to the Reagan administration.\n\nUnder either scenario of block grants or per capita limits, states likely would respond by cutting enrollment, limiting benefits or reducing payment rates to providers and plans, according to Pearson.\n\nLast November the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released an analysis showing that a block grant proposal included in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion — or nearly 25 percent — over ten years, relative to current law.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Bad Guys\n\nBy then, federal funding for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be roughly $169 billion, or about a third less than what it would be under existing law. Another analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal promoted by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage.\n\nAvalere said it used Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) projections from the 2016 Medicaid Actuarial Report and the National Health Expenditure Accounts by state of residence in conducting its research, and the group’s models assumed a Medicaid growth rate tied to inflation.\n\nThe report’s historical simulations start in 2001, with a base year of 2000 for determining initial federal funding levels. The researchers cut off the state level simulations in 2008, to avoid measuring the effects of a major economic stimulus program and the Affordable Care Act, which authorized an expansion of Medicaid. Presumably, the extent of the federal government’s savings and the states’ losses under a block grant approach would be considerably higher if you factored in Medicaid expansion."

    "text": "A central theme running through Donald Trump’s rhetoric, both before and after he won the White House, has been the idea that Mexico is stealing American jobs and that the policies of a Trump administration will be just the thing to bring them back. On Tuesday, though, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said that so far, the actions of the new president are having the opposite effect.\n\nSince winning the election, Trump has continued to promise to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement, to build a border wall, and to punish companies that make products in Mexico for sale in the US. He has even gone as far as berating individual companies in an effort to pressure their CEOs to call off plans to move jobs south of the border.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?\n\nHe has publicly feuded with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over who will pay for the wall. After Pena Nieto’s very public refusal to agree to fund the construction and to meet with Trump in Washington, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer even floated the possibility of imposing a punitive tax on all goods imported to the US from Mexico.\n\nThe net effect of all this news has contributed to a decline in value of the Mexican peso relative to the US dollar. (Though it has recovered somewhat in the past two weeks, the valuation of the peso against the dollar remains at historically low levels.)\n\nThat, Summers said in an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box Tuesday morning, “works out in a counterproductive way” because it increases Mexico’s appeal to companies looking to relocate or expand operations.\n\n“That means anybody thinking about locating in Mexico now has a 15 percent cost advantage,” Summers said. “That 15 percent is huge relative to what he's accomplished yelling at a few CEOs.”\n\nRelated: Trump Inherits a Solid Job Market. Can He Really Make It Better?\n\nSummers’ numbers may be a bit off. The value of the peso is down a little more than 12 percent since Election Day. However, the reduced costs are still substantial.\n\nSummers also criticized plans being floated by the Republican Congress and the White House to implement a “border adjustment tax” that would substantially raise the cost of import while exempting exports from taxation.\n\n“If we do the border adjustment, my guess is that the dollar will rise substantially,” Summers said, which would cushion importers somewhat from higher costs but would also have broad global effects for debtors with loans denominated in dollars.\n\n“I don't think it's a very good idea because I think it will cause financial problems all over the world because all kinds of dollar debtors will be hugely burdened,” Summers said."

But at the Defense Department, top leaders are apparently assuming that when the new president promises to pour money into the military, he really means it.\n\nLeaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines are scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning before the House Armed Services Committee, and they will be bringing a $30 billion wish list with them, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRelated: Defying the Best Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nThe Army is seeking an additional $8.2 billion for modernization and training, according to the Associated Press. A large share of the money will be spent on new attack and transport helicopters. A smaller fraction of the funds would be earmarked for improved training.\n\nThe Navy wants $12 billion to spend on two dozen new F-18 fighter jets, sidewinder missiles, and a new amphibious landing dock ship. The Air Force is seeking a relatively modest $6.2 billion for new F-35 fighters and other “unfunded priorities.”\n\nThe Marine Corps is asking for $4.2 billion, largely to handle costs associated with maintaining readiness in a time of frequent deployments, and to free up funding for a modernization effort.\n\nWhen the generals and admirals appear before Congress, they’ll do so secure in the knowledge that their requests for additional funding come with the express support of the White House.\n\nRelated: Prospects Dim for Deficit Control as Trump Drives for Defense Buildup\n\nOn Monday, speaking at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, Trump promised, “We will make a historic financial investment in the Armed Forces of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense of freedom.”\n\nSpeaking to the Air Force, in particular, he said, “We're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment. You have been lacking a little equipment. We are going to load it up. You are going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me.”\n\nTrump’s promises of lavish spending on the armed forces are in keeping with his campaign promises, but they represent a sharp break from recent years when Congress and the Obama administration battled over government spending and the deficit.\n\nTrump has not given any indication of how he plans to fund the coming expansion of the military."

    "text": "In a radio interview aired during the Super Bowl halftime, President Trump again claimed that he has saved hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars by cracking down on the cost of the F-35, the controversial Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nSince he did jawbone Lockheed Martin and costs are coming down on his watch, the President may well be entitled to some bragging rights. In fact, Lockheed, which builds the F-35, credited Trump with helping to “accelerate negotiations.”\n\nRelated: Air Force General Challenges Trump Over the F-35\n\nBut the savings realized in the deal to sell 90 new F-35s for $8.5 billion – “more than $700 million in savings over the last batch of aircraft delivered,” according to CNN – may have been in the works before Trump took office and may have more to do with volume and manufacturing efficiencies than anything else.\n\nThe cost of producing three versions of the F-35 – one for the Air Force, one for the Navy and one for the Marines -- “caused the program to spin out of control, raising the expected cost to $400 billion for 2,443 planes, The New York Times said. “The Pentagon restructured the project in 2011, and the price of each plane has gradually dropped since then.”\n\nThe good news for the F-35 doesn’t end with cost reductions:\n\nIn combat exercises underway at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, the F-35A (the Air Force version) scored a 15:1 kill ratio against F-16 “enemy” aircraft, according to the military aviation website The Aviationist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe military weapons website Scout Warrior describes the F-35 as combat-ready and suggests that it “could soon be called upon to meet mission requirements in the ongoing air campaign against ISIS.” Scout Warrior cautions that while that prospect in not imminent and possibly years away, it is possible.\n\nRelated: The F-35 Just Aced a Big Test -- and Became Much More Dangerous\n\nStill, it is not all clear skies for the F-35. In a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas last month, the outgoing director of combat testing at the Defense Dept. said the Joint Fighter still has “significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities,” according to Bloomberg.\n\nMichael Gilmore, director of Operational Test and Evaluation since 2009, said that Defense has “no plan to adequately fix and verify” hundreds of deficiencies in the F-35, including “software, weapons accuracy, aircraft-carrier launching, the diagnostic system and reliability,” Bloomberg reported. Gilmore suggested that the Trump Administration needs to review the program rigorously.\n\nIn the 62-page report issued in December 2016, Gilmore said that even with the “risky, schedule-driven approach” of the DOD office running the Joint Strike Fighter program, “multiple problems and delays make it clear that the program will not be able to start IOT&E (Initial Operational Test and Evaluation) with full combat capability until late [2018] or early [2019], at the soonest.”"

    "text": "When you’re saving for retirement, every bit can help — even if it’s a windfall from an unclaimed source. One person in Texas, for example, is owed $395,000 from the federal government. It's not an uncashed lottery ticket. The amount is pension money left behind by someone who either forgot the account existed or, perhaps more likely, may have died before claiming it, in which case it awaits his or her heirs.\n\nThat’s one outsized example of the financial problem of unclaimed property. State, federal and local governments often hold money that people have forgotten is theirs — and total waiting to be claimed runs well into the billions.\n\nPassing Up Pension Money\n\nThe Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, the federal agency that protects retirement savings by taking control of private employer pension funds being closed or that are in trouble, says that millions of pension dollars are owed in total to tens of thousands of people.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons to Do Your Taxes Right Now\n\nThe most current data PBGC could provide, from September 2016, show 24,000 people with a total of $67 million in unclaimed retirement money. The sums range from a measly $5 (easier to send a Starbucks card) to the top, the aforementioned $395,000. See the top 10 states in terms of unclaimed pension money here.\n\nThe pot may get bigger under a proposed rule that would add terminated 401(k) and most other defined-contribution plans, in which people and employers regularly add set amounts.\n\nOther Unclaimed Funds\n\nThese pension sums are a small fraction of the overall money people have left behind and are owed. “The estimate across the country is $50 billion, but that's based loosely on what states report,\" said Mark Bracken, assistant treasurer and director of the Unclaimed Property Division of the Massachusetts Office of the State Treasurer.\n\nThe funds could have come from many sources: bank or other financial service accounts, wages from a job, tax refunds, stock dividends, inheritances, unclaimed life insurance policy payouts or the proceeds from property auctioned to cover tax payments. Typically, people either forget to cash a check or close out an account or some entity that owes a person money lacks the payee’s current address.\n\nRelated: TSA Made $674,841 from Travelers’ Loose Change in 2014\n\n\"We have seen some [cases] in the millions [of dollars],\" said Michael Zwick, president of Assets International, a Southfield, Michigan firm that tracks down people owed money. \"We have a case out of Northern California right now, an older couple that died in their home.\" Officials determined that the wife was the second to die, so her heirs were entitled to the money \"in the high six figures.\" No one knew who the woman's relatives were, so Zwick's company tracked the person down for the estate.\n\nFinding people can be difficult and, when the sums are small, not worth the time of a firm like Assets International. But all states have websites that people can search to see if they are owed money.\n\nHunting for Your Money\n\nA number of federal agencies other than PBGC can also have unclaimed funds and search sites. You can try:\n\nThe National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators has a site for checking multiple states unclaimed property lists at the same time. The site also has a page of links to federal agencies that might have unclaimed property.\n\nThose sites only work once people have to realize they should search, and sometimes knowing which state to check can be tricky.\n\nRelated: Why Your Debt Could Be Killing You — Literally\n\n\"If I had a payee in Montana and I'm in New Jersey, I have to turn over the last claimed check to Montana,\" said Barry Weisman, a partner in the State & Local Tax Group and Tax Controversy Services at New York City accounting firm Anchin, Block & Anchin. However, if a company lacks an address for someone, it turns the money over to its state of incorporation. That could be where the company has its headquarters or might be another state entirely. For example, many businesses incorporate in Delaware. People who don't realize the rules may check with the wrong state.\n\nBefore you get too excited about the prospect of finding lost money, beware of scams. Criminals will contact people and claim they are owed property, which might be true or not. Then they ask for money to process the claim and leave the victim high and dry. \"One of the things we tell people up front is we don't ask for any payment until you get paid,\" Zwick said. If someone wants payment in advance, it's likely a scam."

    "text": "One of the few things that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could agree on during the presidential campaign was the crying need for new highways, bridges, transit systems and dams.\n\nTrump said he favored spending $1 trillion or more on new infrastructure projects over a decade, doubling what his Democratic rival had proposed. And the day after Trump won the election, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California declared that she and other Democrats would be willing to work with the new president and GOP leaders on a major package of infrastructure and transportation project.\n\nRelated: Trump’s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag for Dems\n\nTrump and the Democrats, for the most part, remain in sync on the need for massive new spending to spruce up the nation’s infrastructure and create tens of thousands of new jobs. But profound differences between the Democrats and Republican congressional leaders on the size and makeup of the package – and precisely how to pay for it -- threaten to sidetrack the proposal this year.\n\nThe nation’s massive shortfall in critically needed infrastructure spending has been long documented by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), government watchdog groups and the American Society of Civil Engineers, which repeatedly has graded the U.S. a D-plus in keeping maintaining the nation’s infrastructure compared with the country’s overseas trading rivals.\n\nBy one important measure of the inadequacy of federal, state and local policies, annual public investment in infrastructure has declined from 1.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 1980 to just 0.6 percent of the overall economy in 2015, as the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project notes in a new report. Indeed, the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013 estimated that $3.6 trillion would be required just to bring U.S. infrastructure into a state of good repair, not counting any expansion to the existing infrastructure.\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nThe Democrats recently sought to match Trump when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and a half-dozen other senators unveiled their $1 trillion “Blueprint to Rebuild America’s Infrastructure” – a document aimed at generating more than 15 million jobs by fixing crumbling infrastructure and creating a “21st century network” of transportation systems, water projects, schools, electric grids and other projects.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump and his economic advisers outlined a proposal to offer $137 billion in tax breaks and incentives to private investors with deep pockets willing to invest in toll roads and bridges and other projects that would leverage revenue streams to help retire $1 trillion in debt on these projects. Trump’s transition team also explored whether to establish a national infrastructure bank for other development – an approach long favored by Democrats but opposed by GOP leaders.\n\nSome Democratic critics denounced Trump’s approach as another tax giveaway for the rich that would have a relatively little positive impact on the economy. Ron Klain, a former Obama administration official, warned that the plan would subsidize investors, not infrastructure projects. By contrast, Schumer and the other Democrats proposed to finance their projects through direct government spending – either by raising revenues such as higher corporate taxes or simply adding to the deficit to help stimulate the economy.\n\nSchumer has challenged Trump “to negotiate with us” to come up with a way of dealing with the funding “that we can all agree on,” Schumer said.\n\nRelated: Here’s Why It Will Be So Hard for Trump or Clinton to Rebuild America\n\n“We’re insisting it has to be direct spending,” a Senate Democratic aide explained on Monday. “Real spending and not tax credits that go to the private industry. It has to be real direct spending that’s going into these projects.”\n\nBut this approach to stimulus spending immediately became a stumbling block for the GOP – not as much for Trump as for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) who are insisting that new infrastructure spending must be paid for.\n\nMcConnell, in particular, is opposed to any fiscal or budgetary program that even hints of the Obama administration’s highly controversial 2009 stimulus package that cost the government an estimated $862 billion. Obama promised that the large package of construction projects would boost the economy and create thousands of permanent jobs, but the initiative fell well short of its goals.\n\nMcConnell said late last year, “It will be interesting to see how this is put together,” and he added, “I hope we avoid a trillion-dollar stimulus.”\n\nAnother difference between the Democrats’ and Trump’s approach is that the Democrats favor spending the lion’s share of funds on upgrading or repairing existing roads, bridges and other infrastructure, with lesser amounts paying for shiny new projects that Trump is most interested in.\n\nTo that end, the Senate Democratic plan would spend $210 billion of the total “to repair crumbling roads and bridges,” $180 billion to replace and expand existing rail and bus lines, $110 billion to modernize water and sewer systems and $65 billion to modernize American ports and airports.\n\nThe Hamilton Project’s new “Guide to the Economics of Infrastructure Investment,” released today, “What is less clear is whether … the return from an additional dollar of spending on new infrastructure is still larger than the cost. …Repair and maintenance often have higher returns than new construction. About one-third of the nation’s major urban roads were rated in substandard or poor condition in 2016, generating large costs for motorists.”\n\nThe report endorses a “Fix it First” approach in which more money is allocated for upgrading and repairing existing infrastructure rather than undertaking brand new ventures. “Conducting early and regular maintenance yields large cost savings relative to fixing or replacing roads only after they have become badly damaged,” the report states.\n\nWhether Trump and the Democrats can finally reach an accommodation – and then bring the GOP leaders on board – remains to be seen. But some Democrats are highly skeptical.\n\n\"If the president wants to do a trillion-dollar infrastructure package like ours, I’m sure we can find common ground,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HAWAII) told Politico. \"Count me as doubtful.\""

    "text": "With the restriction on immigration for travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries stayed by a federal court, appeals courts reviewing Donald Trump’s executive order and the State Department reversing its visa cancellations for those affected, you might assume that a rough equilibrium has been established: Americans resisted a ban they considered an affront to their values, and an independent judiciary working its will reversed the whims of a president.\n\nBut even if the courts ultimately disallow the executive order to take effect, the picture of America as a welcoming country for immigrants has changed, perhaps irrevocably. In short, the Muslim ban is working to achieve Trump’s goals, order or no order.\n\nRelated: 12 Facts We Now Know About President Trump\n\nWhen immigrants flee violence or seek better economic opportunity, they must choose where to find refuge. America has historically been a key destination, with not only positive consequences for individuals, but for our economy. Fresh influxes of working-age adults usually expand wages and employment, contrary to claims that immigrants take Americans’ jobs. More workers and consumers create new opportunities for business expansion and output, as we’ve seen in America for centuries.\n\nCreating a hospitable environment for immigrant families is central to making this all work. That’s what the Trump order overturned, even if it accomplishes nothing else. Rolling up the welcome mat could be enough for foreigners to effectively ban themselves from America.\n\nThis Los Angeles Times profile of a naturalization ceremony focuses on Muslim immigrants beginning to wonder whether they want to become U.S. citizens after all. “It doesn’t feel as welcoming right now,” one said. For those who go through the already arduous process to become naturalized citizens, turning back because of one executive order is impractical. But for the student who wants to matriculate at a U.S. research university, or the tourist who wants to see the Grand Canyon, or the young Mexican seeking a better life for their family or the refugee who needs to find sanctuary to relieve their hazardous plight, the decision to avoid America is easier. That was the entire point.\n\nRelated: Why British Parliament Is Threatening to Slam the Door on Trump\n\nSteve Bannon, the white nationalist who masterminded the executive order, appears to simply want fewer non-white people to come into this country. Whether he hits that goal by prohibiting entry or simply by making America more undesirable for people of color is immaterial. Setting the tone can do the work that the Constitution might disallow.\n\nThis won’t necessarily change minds overnight. America still has plenty to offer the foreign traveler. But throughout the next four years, I would gather that visits to the United States from predominantly Muslim countries, and perhaps all countries, will drop, regardless of the fate of the executive order. Eventually, people get the message that they’re not wanted.\n\nSo what does that mean for the country? Let’s start with research, where one out of every six scientists working in the U.S. is an immigrant. Will they continue to flow in, or choose other developed countries in Europe or Asia to ply their trade? And what does that mean for basic research in America? None of the answers to those questions are good for innovative enterprises or the future of scientific breakthroughs, which rely on close collaboration and networking.\n\nRelated: Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?\n\nThe impact on research science closely mirrors the fallout for higher education. Practically every academic site in America has spoken out against the travel ban, because they know it will reduce the level of talent on their campuses. Students with scholarships to American universities are now considering Canadian alternatives, and applications to top schools to the north like McGill and Brock University have surged.\n\nIn an interview during the presidential campaign, Bannon steered Trump away from believing that foreign students who benefit from our educational resources should be allowed to stay here to work or start businesses. The best way to prevent that is to stop the pipeline at the source. And that simply denies the country productive capacity from individuals who want to work here.\n\nThere’s some early evidence that the travel ban has already had an impact on the tourism industry, which supports over 1 million domestic jobs. Various international booking agents are showing fewer searches for U.S. flights. The red tape that international airlines experienced with the rocky rollout of the ban could make them less likely to add or maintain their flight schedule.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nIn other words, the travel ban — and more importantly, the belligerent posture toward immigrants from official sources at the height of the government — is a self-inflicted wound. Those in power just wanted to make it hard, humiliating and treacherous to enter the United States as a foreign national. They’ve done it — to the harm of not just our image abroad, but to tangible segments of our economy and society.\n\nThe flip side of this is that, as much as the tone of unfriendliness locks people out, it also locks people in. Dual citizens who travel back and forth to their home countries probably won’t go as much. Severing those ties keeps them stateside, where millions of immigrants from abroad, both legal and undocumented, already live and work and play. In America, a retreat into white supremacy is impossible at this juncture. As of 2010, four states, including my home in California, are majority-minority. The country is headed in that direction by 2044, according to a recent Brookings Institution report. There are more Latinos in the Golden State than Caucasians.\n\nEven if walls were erected and foreigners kept away, America is browning in ways that are inescapable. Ultimately, that will crumble the effort to use anger as a weapon to stall an inevitable future. To the immigrant, America shows an unwelcoming face in the Trump era. But that face is bound to change, both in color and in temperament."

    "text": "Phew, what a dizzying few weeks: Protests, travel bans and fake massacres have made this an eventful time, to say the least, with our commander-in-chief signing executive orders at a blistering pace, even as he lashes out at opponents on Twitter.\n\nOf course, behind the pen and tweets there’s an actual man with dining and leisure preferences, skin and hair regimens and other individual quirks. Here are 12 things we’ve learned about the 45th U.S. president in his first weeks in office:\n\nWhat he eats: Known for gobbling Big Macs, Domino’s pizza and KFC fried chicken on the campaign trail, Trump has traded those fast-food treats for very well-done steak and potatoes, crab and shrimp and Cobb salads. For snacks, he reaches for original-flavored Lay's potato chips and vanilla-flavored Keebler Vienna Fingers.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nWhat he drinks: Trump eschews coffee and gets his daily intake of caffeine from Diet Coke. He sometimes substitutes a regular, full-sugar Coke during stressful times. Even though Trump’s a known teetotaler, he does enjoy a Bloody Mary — sans alcohol — as a special drink.\n\nBeauty sleep: Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the president gets four hours of sleep each night “at best.”\n\nExercise routine: A round of golf — using a golf cart — is the only exercise Trump gets.\n\nWhat he reads: Not a bookworm, Trump mostly sticks to news articles. His go-to sources are The New York Times and the New York Post, both of which he reads every morning. He also skims The Wall Street Journal, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: ‘Trump’ Turns Into a Minefield for Retailers\n\nWhat he watches: Mostly cable news: Morning Joe, Fox & Friends and CNN in the morning. On Sunday, Trump takes in the morning political talk shows, especially Meet the Press, and later tunes into 60 Minutes. His past tweets also indicate that Trump watches (and criticizes) Celebrity Apprentice, Saturday Night Live and The O’Reilly Factor.\n\nWhat he listens to: Trump reportedly listened to a lot of talk radio in New York, but there’s no word if that has continued in D.C.\n\nHis tweeting: Since becoming a Twitter user in 2009, Trump has averaged about a dozen tweets a day. His activity is highest in the morning when he watches news shows. There are rumors that Trump’s tweets become more aggressive when his son-in-law Jared Kushner is observing the Sabbath on Saturdays and not available to moderate his tweets.\n\nWhat he wears: Despite being fastidious about what his staff wears — women should “dress like women” — Trump has his own fashion faux pas: His ties are too long and he doesn’t button his suit. He prefers Brioni suits that cost up to $17,000 each. Trump also doesn’t wear a wedding band. He’s been married to Melania since 2005.\n\nRelated: 15 Facts You Didn’t Know About Donald Trump\n\nHis skin regimen: The president takes tetracycline to control rosacea, a skin ailment that can cause blushing or flushing with visible blood vessels, according to Trump’s doctor, quoted in The New York Times. The article didn’t discuss if the medication contributes to Trump’s orange skin tone, the cause of which remains a mystery.\n\nAnd his hair? Trump also takes Propecia, a prostate-related drug that treats male-pattern baldness, according to The New York Times article.\n\nIs he a germaphobe? Trump’s doctor couldn’t verify that one way or another. Trump himself is no help. At his first press conference in January after the election, he told the press, \"I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way — believe me” when addressing the naughtier and unverified parts of a dossier published by BuzzFeed News. But in an August 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trump said he wasn’t a germaphobe, claiming by way of proof that, “in Iowa, I must have shaken 2,000 hands.”"

    "text": "The base price of the most commonly used brand-name drugs rose on average by nearly 11 percent in 2016, providing added grist to the debate over the need for government intervention to slow the rate of growth of pharmaceutical prices and eliminate blatant price gouging.\n\nA new study released on Monday by Express Scripts, a major pharmacy benefit management services based in St. Louis, found that the average price of brand name drugs has steadily risen by more than 200 percent since 2008, far outpacing the 11 percent overall cost-of-living increase during the same period.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices – but Can He Do It?\n\nFrom a base price of $100 set in January 2008, the price of the most commonly used brand medications increased to $307.86 last year (in 2008 dollars), the study found. Prescription drugs for the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis ranked as the costliest therapy class. Indeed, one out of every five dollars spent on pharmaceuticals was for those medicines, according to the report, followed closely by spending on medications for the treatment of cancer.\n\nThe drug industry has argued for years that the high costs of developing and testing the new class of drugs called biologics, which targets the disease by targeting the gene that causes the problem, are a big part of the problem. Abbvie’s (ABBV) Humira is a perfect example. A report in Forbes shows that even if it cost what the industry claims is $2.5 billion to develop a biologic drug, Humira earned it back and then some long ago. The drug generated $14 billion in sales in 2015 alone. Forbes says a biologic can cost $50,000 or more a year per patient, which is a killer for consumers, insurers and taxpayers.\n\nSoaring drug prices surfaced as a major issue during last year’s presidential and congressional campaigns and is already getting attention from the new administration and Congress. Last week, President Donald Trump summoned the heads of many top drug manufacturers to the White House in a first step towards fulfilling his campaign pledge to crack down on soaring drug prices that have dramatically driven up the costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and employee health programs.\n\nTrump also pledged to speed up Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs to boost competition with more expensive brand names as part of an effort to reduce what he termed “astronomical” drug prices. He also favors accelerated FDA approval of cutting-edge drugs for treating cancer and other life-threatening diseases. “We have to do better at accelerating cures,” he declared.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that pace this year. Over the past two years, the country has been buffeted by high-profile cases of price gouging by drug companies by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs that have been on the market for years.\n\nHowever, the Express Scripts findings on rising brand drug prices tells only part of the story. That’s because the drug industry offers substantial rebates and discounts to preferred buyers and consumers that often substantially reduce the base price, according to industry experts. For instance, Express Scripts, one of the three largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country, is responsible for negotiating rebates based on the list prices of prescription drugs.\n\nThe company boasted today that spending on prescription drugs by its clients was up by just 3.8 percent in 2016, far below the nearly 11 percent national average. Moreover, prices for the most commonly used generic medications declined by 8.7 percent in 2016, according to the Express Scripts analysis.\n\nTrump and some of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill believe that steps to encourage and speed up the development of generic drugs may be the key to revving up competition – and bringing down prices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin consideration this week of a bill that would require the FDA to review applications for generic versions of drugs for which there is little if any competition within 180 days, according to Modern Healthcare.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nThe measure, sponsored by Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR), would also offer pharmaceutical companies that submit such applications a voucher that promises a quicker review of another generic product. “We all remember recent situations where bad actors jacked up the price of older, off-patent drugs because there was no competition,” Walden said in a statement. “We want to make sure that doesn't happen again.”\n\n\n\nBut the bill's proposed six-month review period is only slightly shorter than the eight-month review and action target established by FDA officials last year, according to Modern Healthcare. And it is longer than the four-month goal proposed for certain priority drug applications.\n\nWhile the bill is in line with some of Trump’s stated aspirations for reining in drug costs, it is on the face of it a relatively weak start to addressing a massive problem that is costing consumers and government agencies billions of dollars annually. There will likely be efforts to beef up the legislation with other tougher provisions. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, are pressing for much tougher measures.\n\nRelated: The Most Expensive Prescription Drugs in America\n\n“We have to get the prices way down,” Trump told the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade organization PhRMA, last Tuesday. \"We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.”\n\nAt the top of his meeting with pharmaceutical company CEOs, Trump outlined a number of steps for preventing future surges in drug prices, although he didn’t mention two of the more controversial ideas that he and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton advanced during the campaign: One would allow the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada to enhance competition. And the other would permit Medicare officials to negotiate down prices with major drug companies by eliminating a non-negotiation ban contained in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation.\n\nThe drug companies have strongly lobbied against both of those proposals in the past, warning against intrusive government action that would discourage research and development and prevent job-creating expansion. Trump had nothing more to say about his drug importation and Medicare price negotiation proposals following his meeting with the drug company CEOs.\n\nInstead, he issued a statement supportive of the drug industry and vowing to “oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,” as The Washington Post reported."

    "text": "Two weeks into his brief presidency, most of the headlines about Donald Trump’s foreign policy efforts have been negative. They’ve addressed angry phone calls with allies and other world leaders, and a further poisoning of Washington’s relationship with Mexico over Trump’s border wall.\n\nUntil now, most of the damage appears to have emanated from Trump himself. That changed on Monday, when a senior British lawmaker revealed that the so-called “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom apparently doesn’t extend to welcoming President Trump to speak before the Houses of Parliament.\n\nRelated: Defying the Legacy of the Free World, Trump Instills Fear Itself\n\nJohn Bercow, who has served as Speaker of the House of Commons since 2009, said on Monday that he would block any effort to give trump the opportunity to address the Commons and the House of Lords during a widely-expected state visit later this year, a promise he has the authority to follow-through on.\n\nThe talk of a Trump visit to the UK intensified last week after British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the White House and extended an invitation to the new president to meet Queen Elizabeth. The offer incensed many in the British public. A petition demanding that the invitation be rescinded was submitted to Parliament, and with 1.8 million signatures to date, easily satisfied a trigger requiring lawmakers to debate the proposition.\n\n“We value our relationship with the United States,” Bercow said in the Commons on Monday, according to the BBC. He also pointed out that it is not really within his power to thwart the Queen if she wishes to extend an invitation, saying, “If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.”\n\nHowever, Bercow said that Trump’s accumulated attacks on migrants and refugees, his history of sexist behavior and his disdain for the role of the judiciary in a democratic society show that the U.S. president has not “earned” the right to address Parliament. He said those feelings only intensified after Trump announced an executive order banning refugees from entering the country.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\n“Before the imposition of the migrant ban, I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,” Bercow said. “After the imposition of the migrant ban I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.”\n\nHe added, “As far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.”\n\nWhile Trump and Prime Minister May made a public display of graciousness and restated their two countries’ promises of mutual support, Bercow’s statement pulls back the curtain on what may have become a much more complicated relationship between the two countries.\n\nAs part of the “five eyes” intelligence-sharing network, the U.S. and UK, together with Australia, New Zealand and Canada, work closely together to monitor terrorism and other threats. It will not have been lost on British leaders that the Australian Prime Minister was on the receiving end of one of Trump’s outbursts last week over an agreement by the U.S. to take in refugees.\n\nRelated: The Global Decline of Trust in the Age of Trump\n\nThere have also been reports that British intelligence officials are requesting guarantees from their U.S. counterparts that their most sensitive information on sources and methods won’t be compromised, either purposefully or inadvertently, by a president that they do not regard as disciplined. Trump’s actions while in office, including a widely noted affection for Russian president Vladimir Putin, haven’t helped.\n\nIf Bercow’s comments about Trump are just the beginning of a broader rejection of Trump as a leader among U.S. allies, the impact on U.S. standing around the world, and on national security, could be vast."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/06/States-Worry-Obamacare-Repeal-Could-Hurt-Opioid-Addiction-Efforts",
    "text": "In the three years since the Affordable Care Act took effect, its federally funded expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults has become the states’ most powerful weapon in the battle against the nation’s worsening opioid epidemic.\n\nNow, as Congress and President Donald Trump debate potential replacements for the law, governors, health care professionals and advocates for the poor are cautioning that any cut in federal funding for addiction treatment could reverse much of the progress states have made.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\n“The current plan to replace the Affordable Care Act would cut health care for our most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors and individuals suffering from opioid and heroin addiction,” Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said last month. “This will have a devastating impact for many Pennsylvanians.”\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) offered states the ability for the first time to provide Medicaid coverage to adults without children, with the federal government paying most of the bill. That change, and the law’s mandate that all insurers cover addiction treatment at the same level as medical and surgical procedures, has allowed states to ensure that low-income people can get the care they need, said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health, which represents nonprofit addiction treatment organizations.\n\nSince 2014, an estimated 1.6 million uninsured people with addictions have gained Medicaid coverage in the 31 states plus the District of Columbia that opted to expand the federal-state health care program under the ACA. Not all of the newly insured have sought help for their addictions, but treatment providers are reporting a surge in new patients since the law took effect.\n\nIn addition, the ACA has provided financial incentives for states to test new models for treatment that streamline care and improve outcomes.\n\nAlthough a plan for replacing the federal health law has yet to be announced, House Republicans and Trump have proposed shifting Medicaid to a block grant, in which a capped amount of money would be allocated to each state to provide low-income health care services. By putting more of the cost burden on states, the shift is projected to save the federal government $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nBut most states would be unable to come up with the extra money and would have to scale back efforts to get more people into treatment, said Lisa Clemans-Cope, a researcher with the Urban Institute, which analyzes health care policy.\n\nBecause addiction is a chronic, lifelong disease, a cut in Medicaid funding would stymie states’ efforts to reduce the number of people who are addicted to heroin and other opioids and at risk for drug overdoses. Not only would low-income adults already in treatment be in jeopardy of losing coverage for their continuing care, but budget-strapped states likely would be unable to help others get out of homeless shelters and jails and into treatment.\n\nEscalating Epidemic\n\nMore than 33,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2015, a nearly 16 percent increase over 2014. Since 1999, the number of fatal overdoses of prescription drugs such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet, as well as heroin and other illicit drugs, has more than quadrupled.\n\nAnd the crisis is still raging. Every day 91 people die from an opioid overdose, 3,900 begin abusing prescription painkillers, and 580 people start using heroin.\n\nThe ACA and the expansion of Medicaid was a game changer for addiction treatment, Rosenberg said, because it enabled states to reach thousands of new addicts and provide better treatment for them.\n\nTaking it away would be a major setback that could cause the opioid epidemic to worsen, Rosenberg said. “We already have a shortage of trained addiction professionals. Who will want to enter the field if funding is cut?”\n\nUnder the ACA, states could expand their Medicaid programs to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($16,394 for an individual). The federal government paid all of the costs to cover newly eligible adults in the first two years. Starting this year, the federal share dips to 95 percent of the roughly $53 billion annual price tag for the states that have expanded. If left unchanged, the federal share would decline to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nIn 19 states, Republican governors and legislatures have chosen not to expand Medicaid. And many Republican-led states that have expanded Medicaid have customized their programs to reflect conservative values by adding small monthly premiums and copayments to encourage personal responsibility for health care.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nIn states that have not expanded Medicaid, support for addiction treatment is limited to state and local funds, and federal block grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nBetter Treatment\n\nNational data on the number of people who have received addiction treatment under the Medicaid expansion are not available. But treatment providers in some states that expanded Medicaid report a substantial surge in patients, with most receiving a combination of medications and counseling, an approach that has proven at least twice as effective as treatment that does not include medications.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, where Medicaid was expanded in 2014 by then-Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, Kurt Sheppard, CEO of Valle del Sol community health centers, said he’s seen a 35 percent increase in the number of patients receiving medication-assisted treatment and counseling for opioid addictions.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three opioid addiction medications — methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Most state Medicaid programs pay for all three medications, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and rarely pay for extended residential treatment. In contrast, commercial providers may not be required by the ACA to pay for all three available addiction medications and often limit access to the drugs. They also are the largest payer of costly residential services.\n\nBy providing more effective therapies, Medicaid — the single largest payer of addiction treatment, footing the bill for more than 20 percent of all costs — has been responsible for improving the overall cost-effectiveness of treatment, Rosenberg said.\n\nThe ACA also has rewarded states for developing innovative models for treatment that have resulted in even more effective and cost-efficient outcomes, the Urban Institute’s Clemans-Cope said.\n\nMaryland, Rhode Island and Vermont, for example, have taken advantage of federal money to create what are known as health homes for people with drug addiction, in which their treatment is combined with medical care for related diseases such as hepatitis C, as well as mental health and social services.\n\nOverall, the proportion of hospitalizations for substance abuse and mental illness that were uninsured fell from 20 to 6 percent between 2013 and the end of 2014 in states that expanded Medicaid.\n\nMore Treatment\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, one of 11 Republican governors who decided to expand Medicaid, recently justified his decision in part as a means to help a spiraling number of Ohio residents with drug addictions.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Repeal Could Hurt Retirees on Medicare\n\n“Thank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people,” Kasich said earlier this month as he signed a bill expanding access to the overdose rescue drug naloxone.\n\nOhio added 700,000 new Medicaid recipients under its expanded program. Roughly a third were diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder, according to a recent analysis by the Ohio Department of Medicaid.\n\nIn West Virginia, which has the highest opioid overdose death rate in the nation, Medicaid expansion added 173,000 adults to the Medicaid program, bringing total enrollment to 573,000 people, about a third of the state’s population.\n\nIn 2015, the first year of West Virginia’s expansion, the number of people in treatment for substance abuse shot from 16,000 to 27,000, according to Mark Drennan, director of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association. He said the biggest beneficiaries were adult men who previously had no coverage.\n\nNationwide, states have used expanded Medicaid eligibility to cover previously incarcerated men, allowing them to seek treatment for the addictions that landed them in prison, Rosenberg said. In many places, the coverage has been credited with reducing recidivism rates for people incarcerated for drug-related crimes, she said.\n\nBipartisan Support\n\nBecause the opioid epidemic has spread to every corner of the country, most federal and state politicians know someone who has struggled with addiction or have a family member who has experienced a loss to drug overdose. That helps explain the unusual bipartisan support for treatment funding and other efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, experts say.\n\nLast year, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 and the 21st Century Cures Act, which provide limited federal funding for prevention and treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nIn addition, states have been enacting laws to restrict the prescribing of opioid painkillers, make treatment more available, and increase the use of the overdose rescue drug naloxone.\n\nRepealing Medicaid expansion has been suggested by some Republicans as partial replacement for the ACA. They also have suggested shifting federal payment for all of Medicaid to block grants to the states. Both proposals aim to substantially reduce the federal government’s cost.\n\nBut treatment advocates argue that skimping on federal dollars to fight the opioid epidemic could cost the country more. According to a 2016 report on drugs, alcohol and health by the U.S. Surgeon General, every dollar spent on addiction treatment saves $4 in health care costs and $7 in criminal justice costs.\n\nAnd advocates for keeping the ACA’s Medicaid expansion argue it would not only save lives but ultimately reduce overall health care costs, a clear priority of the Trump administration.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline.

    "text": "When Donald Trump was inaugurated last month and moved into the Oval Office, one of the first things he did was return a bust of former UK prime minister Winston Churchill, which his predecessor had moved to the White House residence, to its place in the president’s formal office. After his performance this weekend he might want to consider moving it back. At a minimum, he should have the courtesy to turn the British Bulldog’s face to the wall.\n\nThe new president has shattered so many norms and traditions that it is difficult to keep track of them, but one of the most egregious -- more damaging than a refusal to divest his assets or his insistence on bringing family members into the White House -- is his constant effort to sow fear among the American people.\n\nRelated: Pence Does Damage Control After Trump’s Embarrassing Judicial Setbacks\n\nTrump stoked worry about immigrants and terrorism throughout his campaign but over the weekend his campaign to convince the American people that they really ought to feel terrorized reached new depths, and demonstrated just how distant his style of leadership is from the kind the country has historically respected.\n\nThe veneration of Churchill by American presidents has its roots in the former PM’s leadership of a traumatized nation during the worst years of the Second World War. At the darkest moment of the battle, when British and allied troops were reeling from the disaster at Dunkirk, he spoke to the nation and urged fortitude and resolve. “We shall not flag or fail,” he promised. The British people would fight the Nazi menace on the beaches and in the streets. “We will never surrender,” he vowed.\n\nWeeks later he urged members of Parliament to prepare for a great struggle. “Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, ‘This was their finest hour.’”\n\nThe pantheon of American presidents has its own examples of leaders who urged the people toward courage in grim times. In Lincoln’s second inaugural, he pressed a war-weary nation to soldier on to the end of a long and terrible Civil War.\n\nRelated: Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban\n\nFondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”\n\nIn the depths of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt famously rallied a nation battered by economic devastation and uncertainty.\n\nThis great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.\n\nChurchill, Lincoln, and Roosevelt were all addressing nations faced with literal existential threats. They responded with calls for unity, strength of purpose, and resolve.\n\nCompare that to what President Trump offered the United States over the weekend. His effort to enact a ban of refugees entering the country and to bar the residents of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the United States had been overturned by a federal judge, and an appeal to have it reinstated was rejected.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nAs a result, the country had returned to the system of immigration control that has served it reasonably well for a long time. Refugees still face a years-long vetting process. Travelers from nations with a history of terrorism are still subject to extra scrutiny when they apply for visas.\n\nBut the reaction from the president bordered on pants-wetting hysteria. Blocking his new rules, he warned on Twitter, would lead to “death and destruction.” He said, “Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision.”\n\nThe tirade of fearful tweets continued all weekend: “The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!”\n\n“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!”\n\nRelated: Trump May Be the First Test Case for His Own Supreme Court Nominee\n\nOf course, Trump’s claims were false. People are not “pouring in,” as a result of the ruling that struck down his travel ban. The country’s immigration system has simply returned to its status quo ante. But at this point, falsehood emanating from the Oval Office has become as predictable as the tides.\n\nWhat’s more troubling at this point is the president’s evident desire to make Americans feel frightened and unsafe. This is not what good leaders do. Good leaders -- the ones who have their busts displayed in places of honor by their allies -- rally people to overcome fear in the knowledge that “unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”\n\nTo be sure, there are leaders whose specialty has been trafficking in fear. History offers many examples of men who have risen to power by convincing the population that they are facing an imminent threat from some shadowy enemy. They have historically held onto power by convincing the people that they and they alone are capable of offering them safety and protection, even when the costs are civil liberty at home and respect abroad.\n\nBut those leaders aren’t typically memorialized with honorary busts. They’ve tended more toward erecting statues of themselves -- statues that are eventually, inevitably, torn down by an ashamed nation."

    "text": "K Street, the euphemism for influence peddlers in Washington, is the center of the swamp that President Trump said he would drain.\n\nBut early indications are that changes in Obama-era lobbying rules along with overhauls of health care, financial industry regulations, the tax code, and immigration policy could keep the swamp alive. Trump's litany of executive orders could bring the fat times back for the army of former government officials, lawyers, and operatives who represent corporate America, Wall Street, Big Pharma, agriculture interests and any other group with an agenda.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nBruce Mehlman, a Republican lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, told The Hill that “companies and associations are gearing up for significant reform opportunities occasioned by an energetic new administration taking office with a supportive Congress.”\n\nThere was a significant drop last year in the amount of money spent on lobbying -- $3.1 billion, the smallest number since 2007 -- and the number of registered lobbyists decreased 3.2 percent from 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP).\n\nThe Hill reported that 9 out of 11 lobbying firms that had revenue of more than $15 million in 2016 saw an election-year decrease over 2015. Even Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, a K Street powerhouse, earned $36 million last year, compared with $39 million in 2015.\n\nBut the Trump Administration is expected to usher in more prosperous days. One reason is that the rules of engagement have changed.\n\nRelated: Trump Puts Five-Year Lobbying Ban on his Political Appointees\n\nAmong the chief differences between the Obama and Trump rules is that while officials the new President appoints cannot lobby the agency for which they worked for five years after leaving office, they can lobby other agencies. And lobbyists can join the Administration if they avoid working on policies they previously sought to influence.\n\nIn a statement after Trump laid out his lobbying rules last week, the bipartisan Center for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington said that despite some positive features, his Executive Order was a step backward from reforms Obama had put in place.\n\nThe statement issued by CREW Chair Norman Eisen, an ethics adviser to Obama, and Vice-Chair Richard Painter, an ethics adviser to George W. Bush, said in part: “[The Trump EO] removes the ban on lobbyists going to work in the agencies that they lobbied. …It’s as if their former employers have embedded agents of influence in the government.”\n\nTrump’s order allows lobbyists to work in his Administration as long as they are not involved in issues about which they lobbied in the two previous years. The Obama rules flatly barred anyone from joining his Administration if they had been registered lobbyists during the preceding year.\n\nObama administration officials were also restricted from contacting their former agencies for two years after leaving office. Under Trump’s EO, that is down to one year except for Cabinet-level officials.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, Eisen said: \"The single biggest insulation that we had, in retrospect, against scandal in the Obama administration was the two-year exit ban. People will pay you to put you on ice for one year and then after that year is up to ply your contacts. But no one wants to pay you to put you in cold storage for two years.\"\n\nThe CREW statement also said that Trump “removes Obama’s additional revolving door restrictions on non-lobbyists when they leave the government. This is another important problem in the tilted special interest playing field: shadow lobbying by those who are not registered and attempt to influence the system. Instead of continuing the Obama restrictions, or even making them tougher, Trump has eliminated them.”\n\nIn the last three months of 2016, “the number of registered lobbyists dipped to 9,050 — the smallest number since 2008, when quarterly filing began,” according to Ashley Balcerzak, writing for the CRP’s OpenSecretsblog.\n\nRelated: Loopholes in U.S. Lobbying Laws Undercut Reforms, Two Watchdog Groups Argue\n\nBut both Balcerzak and Politico suggest that there has been a rise in shadow lobbying – exerting influence while skirting the Lobbyists Disclosure Act. Trump promised to close loopholes in the act, but that would require legislation. However, his EO did broaden the definition of lobbying to includes “preparing and strategizing for contacts that other people make, so it goes further than only restricting registered lobbyists,” Politico said.\n\nOne factor that could loom large as industries and various other groups with an agenda consider how much money to devote to lobbying is the uncertainty about what lies ahead in a Trump Administration. As Thomas Susman, director of governmental affairs at the American Bar Association, told OpenSecrets, “That [uncertainty] leads to interests wanting to get their perspective out there.”"

    "title": "Will Trump Restore 4% Growth or Crash the Economy?",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/06/Will-Trump-Restore-4-Growth-or-Crash-Economy",
    "text": "The Trump administration predicts that its policies will return America to 4 percent annual economic growth, last seen in the 1980s and 1990s. As the new president correctly points out, growth during the Obama years was dismal. Instead of surging out of downturns, as we did in the past, our economy basically flatlined in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThe contrast with previous decades is stark: After a deep recession in the early 1980s, we experienced 7.3 percent growth in 1984 followed by yearly increases of between 3.5 percent and 4.2 percent for the rest of the decade. By contrast, annual growth in the aftermath of the Great Recession has ranged from 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent. The last year in which we experienced 4 percent growth was 2000.\n\nTrump and Republican policy analysts attribute the economy’s poor performance to excessive taxation, overregulation and inadequate infrastructure investment. Undoubtedly, these factors all restrain growth, but their impacts are hard to quantify. Even if Trump is right about what ails the economy, his pronouncements and actions thus far could produce a near-term surge in GDP growth — but it may not be sustainable. Instead, we could see a bubble, followed by a financial crash and a new recession.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Big Threat to Americans That Trump Is Ignoring\n\nLow growth can also be blamed on trends that Trump can’t or won’t address. Since 2012, U.S. exports have remained stagnant largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. This contrasts to the situation in the mid to late 1980s, when exports surged on the back of a plunging greenback. The dollar’s current strength may be reinforced in the coming months as the Federal Reserve — politically independent from the administration — raises interest rates. Worse, Trump’s hardball tactics with U.S. trading partners could result in higher foreign tariffs, further hindering the ability of U.S. companies to sell their goods and services abroad.\n\nDemographic Challenges\n\nFrom a macro standpoint, GDP growth depends on changes in the size of the potentially employable population, labor force participation, unemployment and productivity. In the 1980s, the first of these factors provided the economy with a significant tailwind.\n\nEach month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the size of the “Civilian Non-Institutional Population” — basically everyone over the age of 16 who is not in the military, prison or a long-term care facility, i.e., anyone who could possibly be in the civilian labor force. This population has been growing at about the same rate as it did in the 1980s, but the story changes when you take out people aged 65 and over, who are mostly retired.\n\nRelated: Obama Left Us Much 'Better Off Now Than 8 Years Ago.' Can Trump Top That?\n\nThe accompanying table looks at two roughly comparable post recessionary periods, December 1982 to 1989 and December 2009 to 2016. In the earlier period, the civilian non-institutional population below age 65 increased roughly 1 percent annually, but the more recent period saw growth of only half a percent. That slower rate of increase, which is due to demographic factors, can only be made up in the near term by allowing in more working-age immigrants. But the Trump administration is headed in the opposite direction: It appears that we can expect fewer immigrants and thus a relatively stagnant working-age population going forward.\n\nDecember December 1982 1989 Annual Change 2009 2016 Annual Change Total US Population: Civilian non-institutional population 173,199 187,165 1.10% 236,924 254,742 1.00% Labor Force Size 111,083 124,497 1.60% 153,111 159,640 0.60% Labor Force Participation Rate 64.10% 66.50% 64.60% 62.70% Age 65+ Civilian non-institutional population 25,619 29,462 2.00% 38,362 48,837 3.50% Labor Force Size 2,994 3,445 2.00% 6,672 9,185 4.70% Labor Force Participation Rate 11.70% 11.70% 17.40% 18.80% Below Age 65 Civilian non-institutional population 147,580 157,703 1.00% 198,562 205,905 0.50% Labor Force Size Below Age 65 108,089 121,052 1.60% 146,439 150,455 0.40% Labor Force Participation Rate 73.20% 76.80% 73.70% 73.10% Selected Labor Force Statistics, Amounts in Thousands\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Authors Calculations\n\nThe figures also show some opportunities to increase growth. Labor force participation among older adults, while still low, has been rising. If this trend were to accelerate, more growth would be possible. Among adults below age 65, the labor force participation rate was almost 4 percent lower at the end of 2016 than it was at the end of 1989. If more good jobs become available, many adults not now in the workforce could be enticed to enter. Given Trump’s focus on job creation and the slack in the labor force, he has an excellent chance to boost economic growth at least on a one-time basis.\n\nTrump Inherits a Solid Job Market. Can He Really Make It Better?\n\nLower taxes, less regulation and infrastructure investment would not only create attractive jobs, but they could also boost productivity. With respect to infrastructure, however, the productivity benefit will depend upon which projects are funded. Improvements to our transportation system will reduce time-wasting delays, allowing employees who travel by car or plane during the workday to get more done. On the other hand, a large investment in a 2000-mile border wall won’t provide ongoing economic benefits. Building the wall will create jobs, but once the structure is built, it will not generate new economic activity.\n\nThe Benefits of Deregulation\n\nTrump’s steps toward energy deregulation are especially positive for economic growth. Producing more energy domestically is not only good for oil, gas and coal producers, but it will also hold down energy costs and protect us from price spikes (admittedly, I’m leaving aside the environmental impacts of more fossil fuel production here). While it is common knowledge that the OPEC oil embargo led to a severe recession in the 1970s, analysts often fail to recognize the role of energy prices in the Great Recession. Gasoline prices surged from $2.30 per gallon in early 2007 to $4.10 per gallon in the summer of 2008, before falling back later in the year. As a result, new auto sales collapsed, with higher-priced, gas-guzzling SUVs taking the biggest hit.\n\nRelated: Here’s How Trump Could Drive the Economy Into a Ditch\n\nAlthough energy deregulation should promote economic growth, Trump’s plans to cut financial regulations may backfire. On Friday, the president ordered a review of federal financial regulations with the intention of rolling back the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. This executive order may be followed by an outright repeal of portions of the law later in the year, if Senate Republicans can craft language that will survive an almost certain filibuster.\n\nCriticisms of Dodd-Frank often focus on the law’s impact on smaller community banks and the resultant decline in small business lending. However, web-based lending platforms such as OnDeck, LendingClub and Funding Circle now offer loans to small companies, thereby taking up the slack caused by the closings and mergers among community banks. Indeed, the small brick-and-mortar bank immortalized by the movie It’s a Wonderful Life may simply be a thing of the past: Just as streaming video killed off video rental stores, more technologically advanced, lower-cost alternatives may be replacing local banks.\n\nDodd-Frank’s main intention was to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis by more aggressively regulating large, systematically important institutions. Dodd-Frank reforms such as the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, have made big financial firms less profitable, less dynamic and less exciting places to work.\n\nRelated: Wall Street's Honeymoon With Trump Is Over\n\nWall Street deregulation might draw the best and brightest away from Silicon Valley and back into banking — and in the process trigger a new wave of financial innovation that again ends badly. Some of the preconditions for a bubble are already in place: Stock prices are at record highs, more than triple their March 2009 levels. Meanwhile, the monetary base has more than doubled, providing plenty of raw material for a new generation of financial engineers.\n\nRepealing Dodd-Frank would lower compliance burdens, making banks more efficient and thus better equipped to provide consumers with a wider range of services. But the law must be replaced with other measures to prevent Wall Street from gambling with FDIC-insured deposits and the implicit guarantee of future taxpayer bailouts. Otherwise the crashes of 1929, 2000 and 2008 may not just be distant memories, they may serve as precedents for the Trump era."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/05/Pence-Does-Damage-Control-After-Trump-s-Embarrassing-Judicial-Setbacks",
    "text": "The administration on Sunday attempted to put a positive face on a weekend of embarrassing judicial setbacks that at least temporarily put President Donald Trump’s controversial immigration ban on hold after a week of global protests of Trump’s hard hitting and disruptive executive orders.\n\nVice President Mike Pence -- the administration’s chief tactician for damage control – appeared on four major talk shows today arguing that a federal court judge’s ruling on Friday night against Trump’s hastily implemented actions against tens of thousands of foreign travelers would soon be reversed.\n\nRelated: Trump May Be the First Test Case for His Own Supreme Court Nominee\n\nPence insisted that a majority of Americans overwhelmingly approve Trump’s tough action to root out potential terrorists – despite criticism that the order has created chaos and uncertainty at airports throughout the world and is a blot on the country’s tradition of welcoming immigrants of all religions, including Muslims.\n\n“We believe the judge made the wrong decision,” Pence said on Fox News Sunday. “We’re going to continue to use all legal means at our disposal to sustain that order and move forward and take the steps necessary to protect our country.”\n\nNoting that there is no unanimity among lower court judges on the constitutionality of Trump immigration order, Pence added, “We don’t appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about our national security.”\n\n“From the very outset of his campaign for president and the outset of his administration, President Trump has made clear he’s going to put the security of the American people first,” Pence added. “It is quite clear that the President has the ability to determine who has access to this country when it comes to national security.\n\nTrump fumed and lashed out this weekend after a federal judge in Seattle late Friday ordered a nationwide halt to enforcement of Trump’s week-old order temporarily barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries – including Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – pending an extensive review of U.S. immigration policies.\n\nRelated: Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban\n\nThe bellicose chief executive derisively referred to the judge as a “so-called judge” in a tweet and denounced his ruling as “ridiculous” and contrary to the nation’s best interest. His tweets were reminiscent of Trump’s attacks last year on Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in California of Mexican descent who was hearing a fraud case brought against the now-defunct Trump University.\n\nBut despite the latest presidential histrionics, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco early Sunday rejected the Justice Department’s request that it immediately overturn the ruling of the federal judge, James Robart, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nRobart’s ruling is contrary to another federal court decision in Boston earlier last Friday that upheld Trump’s executive order. Robart’s decision was much broader than the Boston ruling, and it forced the State Department to reverse its cancellation of as many as 60,000 visas.\n\nIt also prompted the Department of Homeland Security and immigration and customs officials to once again permit travelers from the targeted Muslim countries to enter this country, and many started trickling in over the weekend.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit appellate court has asked the attorney general of Washington State, who brought the complaint, and the Justice Department to file additional briefs by Monday. Regardless of how the appeals court finally rules, the question of whether Trump’s executive order was a valid exercise of presidential power or blatant religious discrimination against Muslims is certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nThousands of protesters marched on London Saturday for the second time in a week, to oppose Trump’s ban on travelers from mainly Muslim nation entering the U.S. Meanwhile, an estimated 1,000 people marched in West Palm Beach, Fla., yesterday, near Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, to protest his policies. Some carried a flag-draped coffin that symbolized the death of democracy, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDemocrats have charged that Trump has recklessly exaggerated the impact of Robart’s temporary order by warning that “many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country” because of the judge’s ruling. They also complained that Trump is attempting to intimidate the independence of the judiciary, at the same time he seeks to convince Senate Democrats that his nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil M. Gorsuch, would be a staunchly independent conservative voice on the High Court.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said today that she is alarmed that Trump has issued “a blizzard of executive orders and memoranda” since he took office Jan. 20, including some like the immigration order that was hastily drafted and “most probably unlawful.”\n\n\n\nFeinstein said that notwithstanding Trump’s complaints about Robart’s temporary ruling, the federal court “has a right to make a judgment whether a law or order is lawful and constitutional – and that process has begun. The president is not a dictator,” she said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. “He is the chief executive of our country.”\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) seemed to be criticizing Trump for attempting to belittle the Seattle judge for ruling against his executive order. McConnell said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program that it is “best to avoid criticizing judges individually.”\n\nRelated: Trump Inherits a Solid Job Market. Can He Really Make It Better?\n\nHowever, Pence once again came to the defense of his boss, saying during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press that “The President of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government.”\n\n“We have a long tradition of that in this country,” Pence said. “I think that people find it very refreshing that they not only understand this president’s mind but they understand how he feels about things.”"

    "text": "President Donald Trump has made a head-snapping turnabout on the budget during his first two weeks in office, seemingly transforming himself from the fiscal hawk we saw on the campaign trail insisting he would bring down the long-term debt to a big time spender places budget concerns on the back burner.\n\nTrump and his budget and economic advisers insist that Trump can still do it all: enact massive new spending on defense and missile defense, infrastructure and construction of a wall along the southern border and a historic tax cut while still slowing the growth of the debt with the magic of economic expansion, a freeze on government hiring and elimination of “waste, fraud and abuse.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Budget Chief Set to Cut Spending as Debt Climbs Toward $20 Trillion\n\nBut just as his boasting several weeks back that he was on the verge of unveiling a comprehensive plan to simultaneously “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act proved to be more aspiration than real, a Trump pledge to slow the growth of the nearly $20 trillion gross national debt must be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and government watchdog groups have issued repeated warnings that the country is headed toward trillion-dollar annual deficits, soaring government interest costs and economic instability without a serious course correction in spending and tax policy. The debt currently is projected to rise from 77 percent of Gross Domestic Product to 89 percent by the end of the decade.\n\nA return to a balanced federal budget – once a rallying cry of congressional Republican leaders – is now little more than a pipe dream, especially after Trump made it clear late last month that defense and national security spending must take precedent over all else.\n\n“I want a balanced budget eventually,” Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News late last month. “But I want to have a strong military. To me, that’s much more important than anything.”\n\nRelated: Budget Watchdog to Trump: Government Spending Is on an Unsustainable Path\n\nLast year was the first time the budget deficit rose since 2009 – an ominous sign for lawmakers and policy experts that the government was once again on the road to massive $1 trillion a year deficits that were common during the financial crisis and recession. CBO’s latest projection is for a $559 billion deficit in fiscal 2017 or $28 billion more than last year’s levels.\n\nEven if the new president were more committed to containing or even reducing the annual deficit, it wouldn’t be easy.\n\nA new analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that balancing the budget by 2027 would require about $8 trillion of deficit reductions over 10 years. That would require sharp cuts in domestic and defense spending and savings in entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and other House GOP leaders have a series of “Better Way” plans on the drawing board for replacing Obamacare and sharply reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs through a major restructuring of the health care system; prospects for enactment are iffy at best.\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nSimply putting the debt on a more sustainable growth path during relatively good economic times – an idea that has drawn approval from liberal groups and think-tanks as well as fiscal conservatives – would still require several trillions of dollars of spending cuts and tax increases that would be difficult to enact given the sharp partisan divide in Washington. Just stabilizing the debt at its current level of 77 percent relative to the overall economy would require $3.3 trillion of deficit reduction over ten years, according to the CRFB report.\n\n“Of course, keeping debt at this post-World War II-era record high level is itself a problem because it may not leave much room to deal with future crises,” the analysis states. “Gradually reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 70 percent by 2027 would require more than $5 trillion of savings, and reducing it to 60 percent would require $8 trillion.”\n\nAmid the flurry of Trump’s early spending policy pronouncements, especially his demands for a military buildup in the face of threats from North Korea and now Iran, budget-busting may become the order of the day.\n\n“The Trump administration seems to be spending more of its time talking about where it would increase spending – particularly in defense—than where it would cut it,” said Richard Kogan, a federal budget senior fellow with the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “And there’s no indication that they have scaled back their ambitions for deep, expensive, regressive tax cuts.”\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\n“If this all were to come about, then the debt ratio would rise faster than CBO says, and therefore would be even more undesirable than the current trend,” Kogan said in an interview late last week.\n\nTrump late last month ordered Defense Secretary James Mattis to come up with a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against a possible nuclear attack by North Korea or Iran. He has put Congress on notice that he expects lawmakers this spring to lift the legal cap on defense spending to accommodate his military ambitions – a move that would add $500 billion in the coming decade.\n\nAnd Trump has signed a number of executive orders making it clear that Congress must spend $15 billion or more building a wall along nearly 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. He also wants to hire thousands of new border security agents and immigration officials to beef up security and prepare for mass deportations. And he even hinted or joked that he might have to send U.S. troops into Mexico to help that government combat drug cartels and dangerous gangs.\n\nRelated: Big Deficits Loom as Candidates Pile on Spending and Tax Cuts\n\nAfter seven years of decline following the worst of the Great Recession, the budget deficit is on track to steadily grow again, adding nearly $10 trillion to the overall debt in the coming decade, according to new projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAs annual shortfalls between spending and revenues pile up in the coming years, publicly held debt will rise from 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2017 to 89 percent of GDP by 2027. In dollar terms, publicly held debt – the amount the government borrows to cover revenue shortfalls and keep the government operating -- will increase from $14.8 trillion at the end of this year to $24.9 trillion by 2027, according to CBO’s baseline analysis.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing late last month, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump’s nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, was pressed to explain how Trump intended to pay for a military buildup while keeping a campaign pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare.\n\nMulvaney, a Tea Party conservative and a sharp critic of defense spending and rising debt, replied that his role as White House budget chief would be to “deliver hard truths” to Trump, as The New York Times reported. And one of those truths could be raising the eligibility age for Social Security and tightening other entitlement programs.\n\nRobert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said, “I’m skeptical that we’re going to get a tax bill of many magnitudes, and I think infrastructure spending might be relatively small potatoes,” Reischauer said in an interview. “But they won’t be able to cover the increased spending for infrastructure and defense with any kind of cuts from the domestic discretionary side.”\n\nWhile Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill are determined to lift the spending caps on defense, congressional Democratic leaders are equally determined to raise the caps on domestic programs that are most important to their constituents. Even with control of Congress, GOP leaders will need Democratic support in the Senate to approve major spending measures.\n\n“I would think the deficit is headed up, but not as much as the apocalyptical projections of some,” Reischauer said."

    "text": "It cannot have been an easy weekend for Judge Neil Gorsuch. At a time that ought to be one of the high points of his life, one wonders if the Colorado jurist tapped by President Trump to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court might not be quietly second-guessing his decision to answer the phone when the White House called.\n\nGorsuch was already looking at a really, really painful confirmation process that could result in the Republican Senate majority invoking the so-called “nuclear option” to get him confirmed over Democratic objections. But on Saturday, Trump likely made the entire ordeal infinitely worse.\n\nRelated: Judge Grants Nationwide Temporary Restraining Order on Trump Travel Ban\n\nAt around the time people in Denver were getting up for breakfast on Saturday morning, Trump was rage-tweeting about a federal judge in Seattle. Judge James Robart, late Friday, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the enforcement of the key elements of Trump’s executive order banning refugees and the residents of seven majority Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nIt would have been around 6:12 a.m. Denver time when Trump fired off a tweet that set the legal and political worlds ablaze. And if Judge Gorsuch found his cornflakes turning to ashes in his mouth at that moment, well, it would be no surprise.\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nTrump, with his attack on Robarts as a “so-called” judge, had by most accounts crossed a serious red line. Presidents have often criticized judicial rulings. President Obama famously used a State of the Union address, with Supreme Court Justices arrayed in front of him, to blast their decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case.\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Travel Ban Already Hurting US Tourism?\n\nBut criticizing a decision and questioning the legitimacy of the court are not the same thing. Writing for the Washington Post’s Volokh Conspiracy blog -- hardly a bastion of liberal bias -- Will Baude, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, seemed fairly stunned, calling the distinction “deadly serious.”\n\nIf the court has authority, then the parties are legally required to follow its judgment: even if it is wrong; even if it is very wrong; even if the President does not like it. But if the court does not have authority, then perhaps it can be defied. So the charge of a lack of authority is a much more serious one. It is the possible set-up to a decision to defy the courts — a decision that is unconstitutional if the court does indeed have authority to decide the case.\n\nOn Twitter, Baude’s University of Chicago colleague, law professor Eric Posner, wrote, “Neil Gorsuch must condemn Trump for ‘so-called judge’ remark; his friends in the legal community must withhold their support until he does.” When someone responded that Trump might revoke the nomination at such an affront, Posner said simply, “That’s the price of integrity.”\n\nIntegrity becomes an issue here because, while federal judges are appointed by presidents, they are not supposed to be beholden to them. And Trump’s attack on Robarts, as Posner effectively makes clear, is going to require a response from Gorsuch. That response may come Sunday, or it may have to wait until his confirmation hearings, but at some point in the near future, Gorsuch is going to be asked to condemn the man who appointed him to the highest court -- and to do it in the most public of forums.\n\nThis isn’t the first example of Trump attacking the legitimacy of a federal judge. Famously, during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he spent weeks attacking Gonzalo Curiel, the District Court judge in California who heard a class-action suit against the now-defunct Trump University. Trump frequently claimed that Curiel, who was born in Indiana, could not be objective about the case because his parents came to the US from Mexico.\n\nRelated: Trump Inherits a Solid Job Market. Can He Really Make It Better?\n\nAll of this can only complicate the situation for Gorsuch. He is, by virtual acclamation of the legal community, a brilliant legal mind and an eminently qualified candidate for Supreme Court Justice. He is also, it would appear, a man with a conscience.\n\nWith his first phone call after the nomination was made official, he seemed to acknowledge that he knew he had already bitten into the fruit of a poisonous tree. That call went to Judge Merrick Garland, the eminently qualified candidate nominated by President Obama last year who was denied a hearing or a vote in an utterly unprecedented power grab by the Republican-led Senate.\n\nGorsuch himself had previously spoken out against unseemly partisan delays in the process of confirming judicial appointments, and his decision to call Garland, made “out of respect” according to the White House, looked to many like the act of a man at least troubled by the circumstances in which he finds himself.\n\nTrump, furious at his first collision with the checks and balances built into the Constitution, did his first Supreme Court nominee no favors on Saturday."

In fact, the combination of an opinionated President delivering on many of his controversial campaign promises with a vigor rarely seen and the ever-growing power of social media to affect behavior can be lethal.\n\nJust ask Uber. The ubiquitous ride-sharing service got into trouble when it allegedly attempted to capitalize on a strike by some New York cab drivers at JFK Airport who were protesting the Trump Administration’s so-called “extreme vetting” of visitors from seven Middle Eastern and African countries that many have characterized as a “Muslim ban.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Will Come Back to Bite Him … And Us\n\nUber suspended its surge pricing – higher charges at peak times – at JFK in what was widely seen as an effort to snatch business from the protesting cabbies. Uber denies that was its intention, but the reaction on social media was swift, with the #DeleteUber hashtag trending on Twitter as Uber customers were urged to erase the app on their smartphones and cancel their accounts. One report says that as many as 200,000 accounts were canceled.\n\nIn response to the fury, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from Trump’s economic advisory council, which was scheduled to meet today (Disney CEO Bob Iger said he wouldn’t be able to make the meeting because of a “scheduling” issue). That may help, but at least one competitor is already using Uber’s Trump woes to its advantage: The New York Times reports that Lyft has “ pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union,” which has been at the forefront of opposition to the travel ban. That has sent downloads of the Lyft app shooting up, the Times says.\n\nRelated: Uber Lost at Least $1.27 billion in First Half of 2016: Bloomberg\n\nBut it’s not just Uber that is getting pulled into – or voluntarily leaping into -- the political maelstrom swirling through Washington, and the results can be unpredictable:\n\nStarbucks. CEO Howard Schultz pledged to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years in response to the Trump Administration at least temporarily closing America’s door to Syrian refugees and suspending travel from seven primarily Muslim nations. But that has led to a nascent campaign on Twitter, #BoycottStarbucks that wonders why the international chain doesn’t hire 10,000 vets instead of refugees.

The company scrambled to distance itself from Linda Bean and maintain its political neutrality, but it remains on a boycott list.\n\nRelated: Trump Wades in on flap Over L.L.

The country welcomed 77.5 million international visitors in 2015, according to the U.S. Travel Association. International travel spending directly supported 1.1 million U.S. jobs and $28.4 billion in wages that year.

    "text": "On Friday, with the release of the January jobs report, President Trump’s administration got its first look at the baseline by which many will judge the new president in the future.\n\nThe comparisons may or may not be fair. The policies of a president’s predecessor may have lingering effects that last well into or even throughout their term in office. Trump supporters can and will argue that enthusiasm about his impending presidency sparked growth in the months following his elections.\n\nRelated: Populist on the Trail, Trump Pivots Toward the Banking Industry\n\nAdditionally, global events -- war, natural disaster, foreign economic crises -- can all affect the U.S. economy in ways a president has little control over. And the level of cooperation a president gets from lawmakers is a tremendous factor in determining the degree to which White House policies are able to affect the economy.\n\nBut for Trump -- who declared that he would be “the greatest jobs president God ever created” during his campaign and has repeatedly said that employment growth will be his singular focus while in office -- there will be no escaping the job market comparisons. Even more than other presidents, he will be called to account for job-related failures and feted for job-related successes over the next four years.\n\nSo, it’s worth treating the Bureau of Labor Statistics “Employment Situation Summary” for January as a marker for the transition from the Obama economy to the Trump economy.\n\nBy most but not all measures, the economy Trump inherits is healthy and robust.\n\nRelated: Good News, Bad News for Trump as the Economy Picks Up Steam\n\nU.S. businesses created 227,000 non-farm jobs in January, making it the 76th consecutive month of positive job growth, the longest streak ever recorded. It was also well above the average 187,000 jobs the economy created every month in 2016. Because of Trump’s emphatic promises to bring back manufacturing jobs to the United States, it’s worth noting that even in a strong month of growth, the economy added just 5,000 jobs in that sector.\n\nThe official unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people who were actively seeking work in the month of January but were unable to find it, sits at 4.8 percent, or about 7.6 million people. That is at or near the level most economists consider the “natural” rate in a healthy economy.\n\nHowever, there were another 5.8 million people considered “employed” in the survey who reported that they were actually only working part time, even though they would prefer full-time employment. That’s fewer than a year ago, but is still high by historic standards.\n\nAbout 1.9 million of the unemployed are considered long-term jobless, meaning they have been out of work for six months or more. That figure has been declining slowly but steadily for several years now.\n\nStepping back, another 1.8 million were considered “marginally attached” to the workforce, meaning they did not look for a job in January, but would like to work and have sought employment in the past 12 months. Among those, 532,000 were “discouraged” workers, who said that although they would like to work, they have given up looking entirely.\n\nRelated: The GOP’s ‘Repeal and Replace’ Obamacare Is Becoming ‘Repair and Fix’\n\nThe labor force participation rate, a number Trump focused on in his campaign, continued to improve, rising 0.2 percent to 62.9 percent. After a years-long decline, the percentage of Americans in the workforce appears to have stabilized at around 63 percent. That is still low by historic standards, but much of the decline is attributable to an aging population.\n\nWage growth was positive but slow, rising $0.03 to $26 per hour, a 2.5 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nWhen pundits and voters -- and potential challengers -- start taking stock of Trump’s performance in advance of the 2020 elections, these are the numbers that they will use as the baseline. Just as it was normally noted that President Obama took office at a time when the country was shedding 800,000 jobs every month, people will point out that Trump took office with steady growth and most indicators moving in the right direction, if slowly.\n\nIn a sense, he may have a harder task ahead of him than Obama did. By the time he ran for reelection in 2012, the economy wasn’t roaring, but at least the president had a story to tell. He was able to point to two straight years of solid job growth and a declining unemployment rate. He could plausibly tell Americans that the once fearful prospect of a full-on depression was no longer a worry and that the country was indisputably on the mend.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nHowever much he wants it, Trump probably isn’t going to be able to tell a credible ‘turnaround’ story like that four years from now.\n\nUnless you believe his promises to drive U.S. economic growth rates above 4 percent, which most economists do not, Trump will likely be telling a tale of incremental progress at best. If he can maintain employment and wage growth at current rates, chipping away at the number of underemployed Americans and drawing others back into the workforce, the narrative will be positive, just not terribly dramatic.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, he’ll have to do it while butting up against a lower bound in the unemployment rate, and in the face of a Federal Reserve that is likely to spend the next several years gradually increasing interest rates from their current rock-bottom levels.\n\nIt’s a tough task, but hopefully nothing the “best jobs president God ever created” can’t handle."

    "text": "President Donald Trump and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill just moved ahead with their promised rollback on Obama administration environmental rules, making it clear that concerns about climate change, clean water, and public health must take a back seat to job creation and economic expansion.\n\nIn a flurry of congressional activity, the Senate took final action early Friday morning to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which was designed to protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests from rocks and debris generated by coal industry surface mining and so-called mountaintop removal. The House previously approved the measure, and it now goes to the White House for Trump’s signature.\n\nRelated: Environmentalists’ Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True\n\nThat rule was deemed critical by environmentalists and public health advocacy groups in Appalachian coal communities to protect the nation’s waterways and prevent the contamination of drinking water and other public health threats.\n\nBut the Trump administration and mining industry complained that the rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs and that the estimated $52 million in annual compliance costs was too steep a price to pay. Scientists say that surface mining – especially mountaintop removal – cause serious local air and water pollution and contributes to higher rates than normal of cancer, heart and lung disease, and even birth defects.\n\nSome analyses show that economic costs of health problems in Appalachian coal mining areas are more than five times greater than the economic benefits from mining. Beyond contributing to climate change, outdoor methane leaks contribute to smog, which aggravates asthma and other respiratory conditions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and major foe of Obama administration policies, said the stream buffer rule “is a harmful regulation that unfairly targets coal jobs.” The House, meanwhile, passed a resolution today to reverse a rule from the federal Bureau of Land Management mandating companies to control their hydrocarbon emissions on public lands took effect in mid-January requiring oil and natural gas companies drilling on public lands to control methane gas emissions that directly contribute to global warming.\n\nRelated: Trump v. Truth: How Will the New Administration Make Policy?\n\nHouse Republicans and the oil industry insisted that the rule would put a major crimp in energy production on federal lands by restricting drilling, reducing the number of jobs and cutting into tax and royalty payments to state and local governments.\n\n“It is a costly rule and totally unnecessary rule,” said Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, according to The Hill. “This rule’s repeal is a vote for people, and making sure that their lives are better, not worse.”\n\nTaken together, the two actions constitute a stern warning from the Trump administration that scores of environmental regulations will be put on the chopping block. Trump, a global warming skeptic who once dismissed climate change as a “hoax,” has nominated an arch foe of the Obama administration’s anti-coal, clean power policies to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday used their majority to suspend committee rules and push through Trump’s choice, Scott Pruitt, bypassing Democrats who had refused to show up for a vote on his nomination. Pruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney general, has been a leading advocate against what he calls “EPA’s activist agenda” and filed briefs in 14 lawsuits against EPA policies, including President Obama’s signature clean power initiative to reduce industrial carbon emissions.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama’s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nIn both congressional actions to roll back the Stream Protection Rule and the oil and gas drilling rules, Congress invoked an obscure law, the Congressional Review Act. That law allows lawmakers to rescind executive actions taken during the previous 60 legislative work days if the rule threatens to impose excessive costs or exceeds presidential authority.\n\nUntil now, the 1996 Congressional Review Act was invoked only once by Congress, during the Clinton administration, and was conceived of as a rifle shot to be held in abeyance except in cases of extreme presidential overreach. But as part of the planned, all-out warfare against Obama environmental protections, House and Senate Republican leaders intend to use the CRA to go after a wide array of provisions.\n\nTrump championed the fast declining coal industry during the campaign and blamed the overly zealous environmental policies of the Obama administration as a principal cause of economic despair in coal country. He has promised mining communities in West Virginia, Kentucky and other Appalachian areas that he would help bring back jobs – in part by getting rid of onerous regulations like the Stream Protection Rule.\n\nThat rule would have virtually eliminated exceptions to a requirement for a 100-foot buffer between surface coal mining and streams. The rule would also have forced coal companies to restore streams, and adjoining forests and land to conditions similar to those before mining took place.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nWhile highly efficient in maximizing coal production, mountaintop removal is not only a brutal disfigurement of a natural resource; it is notorious for deforestation, destruction of headwater streams, and the contamination of downstream surface waters. Those mining practices over the years have killed fish and wildlife and posed public health problems for residents in the area.\n\nWhat’s more, imposing the regulation is not a job killer. Fewer miners are needed to operate massive bulldozers and cranes used in blasting away the sides and tops of mountains. A recent Congressional Research report outlining the pros and cons of the rule noted that even without the measure, the coal industry would decline by more than 15,000 workers, from a total of 90,000 in 2012."

    "text": "After a campaign spent railing against his opponent’s connections to Wall Street banks and promising to stand up for ordinary Americans against the moneyed interests holding them back, President Trump is preparing to take major regulatory action in the financial services field. But it may come as a surprise to his voters exactly where his focus will be.\n\nOn Friday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order launching an effort to roll back regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, a post-financial crisis law that created mechanisms to prevent the sort of out-of-control risk-taking and predatory lending practices that contributed to the housing bubble and the Great Recession.\n\nOver the years, Dodd-Frank, with its more than 22,000 pages of regulations, has helped accelerate the consolidation of the banking industry. The New York Times reports that the number of community banks in the US shrank 14 percent between 2010 and 2014.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nBut the assault on Dodd-Frank isn’t the only thing the new administration is planning. Trump will also order the Labor Department to halt the implementation of the so-called “Fiduciary Rule,” a new regulation that requires retirement plan advisers to recommend the products that best suit the needs of their clients.\n\nUnder current rules, which the industry is fighting hard to retain, retirement planners are free to steer clients toward investments that carry higher commissions, even though they are aware of other products that would provide better value for their clients.\n\nFurther still, a Republican-led Congress, cheered by the prospect of having one of their own in the White House prepared to sign off on their legislation, seems poised to start asserting itself in the oversight of the nation’s financial regulators.\n\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times newspaper published a January 31 letter that Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee had sent to Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nIn it, McHenry said that it is “unacceptable” that the US central bank, which has wide supervisory authority over the financial services industry, “continues to participate in international forums on financial regulation.”\n\nThe Fed, along with the central banks of most developed countries in the world, has long negotiated with international groups including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. Bank regulators see these groups as necessary to assure that the global financial system works smoothly and that the industry’s major players operate according to a general set of guidelines that regulators understand.\n\nMcHenry said that the requirements imposed on American businesses by these international bodies are overly burdensome and their negotiations too opaque.\n\n“The Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America’s best interests.”\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban -- Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nAt least with respect to some elements of banking regulation, McHenry seems to be confused. US regulators are, by and large, far more strict than their foreign counterparts. McHenry identified bank capital requirements in particular -- rules dictating how much cash and liquid assets banks must hold against unexpected losses -- as something that foreign regulators have forced on US banks. In fact, it has for many years been US regulators who demanded higher capital requirements, often frustrating their European counterparts in particular.\n\nThe administration is also expected to join Congressional Republicans in their efforts to defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and to roll back authority given to federal regulators meant to facilitate the “orderly liquidation” of banks and other financial services firms that fail.\n\nThat Trump, who sold himself to voters as the champion of the little guy, should be granting big banks so many of the things on their wish list just two weeks into his term might seem surprising, but there has been no shortage of clues about where the administration was headed.\n\nRelated: Trump’s SCOTUS Nomination: One Way or the Other, This Ends Badly\n\nOne of Trump’s favorite targets on the campaign trail was Hillary Clinton’s connections to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, but he has since populated his administration with Goldman alumni and other Wall Street veterans. The architect of the regulatory rollback is White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Cohn signaled that there are good times ahead for financial services firms chafing under increased regulation since the financial crisis. Today’s executive orders, he said, are “just a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming.”"

    "text": "Long before Republican Donald Trump was sworn in as president January 20 and began upending conventional norms of government and harshly rewriting U.S. policy on immigration, trade and the environment, people throughout the world were voicing a shocking disdain for political and business leaders and institutions of all stripes.\n\nThe 2017 edition of the Edelman TRUST BAROMETER – a long-standing annual measure of worldwide opinion – has revealed what its authors described as “the largest-ever drop in trust across the institutions of government, business, media and NGOs.”\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nThe news media -- which was caught by surprise by Trump’s stunning presidential victory and the Brexit vote in Great Britain to leave the European Union – suffered the biggest beating in the new survey, with just a 43 percent trust level among the public. Governments and their leaders didn’t fare any better at 41 percent, which made them “the least trusted institution” in half of the 28 countries that were surveyed on-line or the project.\n\nCompounding the gloom, the Trust Barometer “found that 53 percent of respondents believe the current overall system of governments and institutions has failed them and offer little hope for the future, according to the authors.\n\n“The implications of the global trust crisis are deep and wide-ranging,” wrote Richard Edelman, president and CEO of Edelman, a prominent global communications marketing firm. “It began with the Great Recession of 2008, but like the second and third waves of a tsunami, globalization and technological change have further weakened people’s trust in global institutions. The consequence is virulent populism and nationalism as the mass population has taken control away from the elites.”\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nNowhere is this trust deficit and deep fracturing of the voters more pronounced than in the U.S. in the wake of the historic 2016 presidential election. In a special section of the Trust Barometer survey focusing on the U.S., the pollster documented the profound chasm separating attitudes and the mindset of Trump supporters and those who voted for Democrat Hilary Clinton.\n\nOn the most fundamental question of whether people accept Trump’s presidency as legitimate (after revelations of Russian interference and FBI Director James Comey’s startling last-minute public statements on the status of Clinton’s email investigation era), 96 percent of Trump supporters said the election outcome was a “fair and accurate” reflection of the will of the people, while only 34 percent of Clinton supporters agreed with that statement.\n\nMoreover, 77 percent of Trump voters said they trust the new administration to do what is right, while a mere eight percent of Clinton supporters feel the same way. At the same time, there appears to be widespread remorse among many who didn’t bother to vote. Twenty-eight percent of all those surveyed said they regretted having stayed home that day.\n\nClinton lost in part because she couldn’t attract younger voters to her side, many of whom preferred Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) or some third party candidate. Now 43 percent of millennials, the young Americans just now coming into their own, said they regretted their decision to skip the election.\n\nRelated: Could Trump’s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?\n\nBut for all of the differences between Trump and Clinton backers, there were also some similarities.\n\nOne surprising finding was that the demographic divide was not as great as one might imagine. A third of Trump and Clinton voters have annual incomes of $100,000 a year or more, and little more than half of the two groups are college educated. Still, Trump voters were more likely to be white, male and over 50 years of age than Clinton’s supporters.\n\nAnd while the two sides were in agreement on policy priorities more often than not, there were still some important differences in their attitudes.\n\nThere is strong support among Trump and Clinton partisans alike for holding corporate executives accountable for business scandals and financial meltdowns (roughly 80 percent of both sides agree) and allowing the government to regulate the pharmaceutical industry and pass legislation to address climate change (roughly 63 percent of Trump and Clinton voters agree).\n\nHowever, Trump backers are far more protectionist on trade issues than the Democrats are, and they favor the new president tearing up long-standing trade agreements like NAFTA. Trump supports are also far more fearful of immigration and globalization than Clinton backers.\n\nFinally, the survey makes it clear that Trump supporters heartily share the new president’s contempt for the media and are far more inclined than Clinton voters to find a way to regulate or rein in news organizations."

    "text": "While it’s impossible to know for sure what the political and economic landscape will look like years from now, a new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office should give some confidence to Republicans about the conditions they’ll be facing when mid-term elections come around in 2018. But the same can’t be said for President Trump and lawmakers facing reelection in 2020.\n\nThe new report on labor market projections suggests that when voters go to the polls in 2018, unemployment rates will be so low that economists will consider the country to be “above” full employment. What’s more, it suggests that by that time, hourly labor compensation will have been on a sharp upward trend for nearly two years.\n\nRelated: Trump May Try to Weed Out Immigrants Who Cost Taxpayers $279 Billion Annually\n\nThe declining unemployment rate, the report finds, “reflects a projected increase in demand for labor that would reduce the number of unemployed people. However, the stronger demand for labor would also encourage people to remain in the labor force or rejoin it, making the labor force larger and thus moderating the decline in the unemployment rate.”\n\nIt’s important to note that the economy will still be operating below its full potential in 2017 and 2018, but progress will be apparent both in the employment numbers and in wage growth, which is expected to accelerate.\n\n“As slack diminishes and firms must compete harder for a shrinking pool of unemployed or underemployed workers, growth in hourly compensation will rise, in CBO’s assessment,” the report finds. “CBO estimates that the employment cost index for workers in private industry will grow by more than 3 percent per year, on average, over the next several years, up from the 2 percent average from 2010 through 2015. Other measures of compensation, such as the average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers in private industries, are similarly expected to grow more quickly than in recent years.”\n\nRelated: Could Trump’s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?\n\nAll this is good news for Republicans in Congress who will face the voters in 2018 after two years of complete GOP control of Washington. However, by the time 2020 comes around, CBO expects some of the shine to have worn off the recovering economy.\n\nBy 2020, wage growth will be slowing again, and the real unemployment rate will have started creeping up above the natural rate once again. If the CBO projections hold, that would mean that, all other things equal, President Trump could face a somewhat rockier election field in 2020 than his GOP colleagues did two years prior."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/03/Trump-Talks-Putin-and-Suddenly-Ukraine-s-Play",
    "text": "Fighting erupted in Ukraine after many months of uneasy but consistent calm after Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the U.S. and Russian presidents, finally spoke for the first time last weekend by telephone. Instantly, the Trump White House is faced with one of the tough foreign policy questions that proved quite beyond Barack Obama’s capacities. By most accounts, Ukraine wasn’t a major topic during the Trump–Putin exchange, but Trump has a major policy judgment on his hands now.\n\nRelated: No, Trump Did Not Just Roll Back Sanctions on Russia\n\nWhile Trump was always clear about defrosting ties with Russia during last year’s campaigns, it was among the many ideas that came with a question. Will he or won’t he remove the sanctions, given formidable opposition to any such idea in the Pentagon, the national security agencies, and NATO?\n\nNow we know. This isn’t a hotel deal or a Miss Universe pageant or some kind of mutual admiration club. Détente is the White House policy as of last Saturday. The two leaders did not discuss the Western sanctions against Russia now in place, and there was no talk that Russia meddled in the elections to put Trump in the White House.\n\nIn a 50–minute exchange, they spoke of making common cause against international terrorism and improving economic ties; they determined to hold a summit—the shake-hands kind—later this year. Trump did sign a memorandum, the same day ordering security agencies to devise a new anti-terror blueprint. Among its instructions was “identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS.”\n\nSounds like the beginning of a détente story, although John Kerry and the Obama administration tried for months to cut a deal on “the possibility of Russian-American cooperation in the fight against terrorist groups in Syria.\" Clearly, cooperation does not always signal détente. For Donald Trump, terrorism is an obvious call as a shared concern between Moscow and Washington. But don’t think for a moment the defense and security establishments are going to rest their case against any warming of U.S.–Russian ties.\n\nRelated: In Trump’s White House, Even the Leakers Can’t Get Their Stories Straight\n\nThe renewal of violence in Ukraine, this time centered on the town of Avdiivka, is a direct test of Trump’s determination to stick to his position on U.S.–Russian relations. Whoever is responsible for renewing the conflict—and we can’t know this yet—seems to have just this test in mind. Given the timing, it’s logical to start with who has the most to gain or lose in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russian media make plain, Moscow’s practically breathless to enter a “new partnership” with Washington. It’s hard to think why Putin would follow a successful first encounter with battlefield aggression.\n\nThe Washington Post postulates that Russia’s intent was to sabotage a meeting this week between Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Does this make sense? Merkel force-marched Poroshenko into the ceasefire known as Minsk II—signed two years ago this month—and has consistently favored a settlement very close to Putin’s idea of a Ukrainian federation. More likely, a report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty direct from Ukraine last Monday is on point:\n\n“Frustrated by the stalemate in this 33–month war of attrition, concerned that Western support is waning, and sensing that U.S. President Donald Trump could cut Kyiv [Kiev] out of any peace negotiations as he tries to improve fraught relations with Moscow, Ukrainian forces anxious to show their newfound strength have gone on what many here are calling a ‘creeping offensive.’”\n\nTrump is in a spot either way. The news from Ukraine strengthens the hand of those opposed to his détente project. He could drop it, but that’s unlikely since his commitment to better ties appears serious and durable. Is the Trump White House smart enough to huddle with Merkel and resuscitate the barely breathing Minsk II, which the U.S. was not asked to negotiate? Let’s hope so: It remains the most promising proposition on the table.\n\nIn the bargain, the president could improve his approval ratings among the Europeans who are fed up with the standoff over Ukraine. He could use the boost, to put the point mildly."

    "text": "The Sea Hunter, the Navy’s new, unmanned nautical drone that can detect even the quietest submarines, is already causing alarm bells to ring in China.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nDeveloped by DARPA beginning in 2010 as part of the secretive research agency’s $100 million Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program, the Sea Hunter was launched last April and is now undergoing testing.\n\nIts capabilities, at least on paper, make clear why other navies might be concerned:\n\nA self-piloted trimaran (a main hull and two outriggers), the 132-foot-long Sea Hunter is capable of cruising on the open seas for 70 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts range is 10,000 nautical miles. “You could go from San Diego to Guam and back to Pearl Harbor on a tank of gas,” Scott Littlefield, project manager for the ACTUV, has said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA remotely based operator can control the Sea Hunter with a joystick, but it is also capable of operating autonomously and has the ability to steer clear of other vessels on its own. It can also handle rough seas.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy sending acoustic “pings” into the ocean depths, the Sea Hunter can determine the shape, size, speed and characteristics of any undersea activity, according to the website Scout Warrior. And it can do so from more than 11 miles away, Chinese analysts figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore important, the Sea Hunter can detect electric-diesel subs, which are proliferating in the navies of countries ranging from Indonesia to Russia and China. On the website of Leidos, a defense company that helped develop the Sea Hunter, Rear Admiral Frank Drennan, head of the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command, is quoted as saying that trying to identify an electric-diesel sub in crowded coastal waters “is like trying to identify the sound of a single car engine in the din of a major city.”\n\nChina has one of the largest submarine fleets in the world, according to the website of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, including more than 50 electric-diesel attack submarines, and it is planning to build more.\n\nRelated: The Emerging Arms Race at Sea for the US, China and Russia\n\nIn an article in The National Interest, Lyle Goldstein, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College’s China Maritime Studies Institute, says that in” a single (and seemingly quite affordable) stroke,” what he calls the “robot ship” may be a nautical warfare game-changer.\n\nAfter looking at a number of Chinese analyses of the Sea Hunter, Goldstein concludes that the People’s Liberation Army Navy is worried. He quotes one Chinese strategist as saying the Sea Hunter is “a severe challenge to our country’s future submarine force.”\n\nAt a cost of about $20 million each, Goldstein says that the Chinese figure Sea Hunter-type drones are 10 times cheaper than P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/02/GOP-s-Repeal-and-Replace-Obamacare-Becoming-Repair-and-Fix",
    "text": "Now that it’s clear they still don’t have a coherent plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, some Republicans are rethinking their strategy.\n\nInstead of vowing to “repeal and replace” Obamacare – a rallying cry that dates back to March 2010, shortly before President Obama signed his historic health care plan for uninsured Americans – many prominent Republicans are now promising to “repair and fix” a program that is growing in popularity and now covers more than 20 million Americans.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nShaken by increasingly dire forecasts from major insurers, hospital administrators, GOP governors and mayors and consumer advocates that the health care insurance market could be in shambles by the beginning of 2018, Republican leaders for the moment are taking refuge in a semantics game suggesting that surgical changes in the law might be preferable to wholesale dismantling.\n\nWhile die-hard heavyweights including President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) continue to cling to the upbeat but misleading message that their party is on the verge of repealing and replacing the troubled health insurance program, second-tier Republicans stuck with the task of actually designing a replacement have begun ducking for cover.\n\nSince returning from a three-day policy retreat in Philadelphia where many rank-and-file House and Senate members privately vented alarm that their party could end up being blamed by millions of voters for the loss of their insurance coverage, Republican lawmakers have been taking the “repair and fix” mantra out for a test run.\n\n“Our goal is to repair the damage caused by Obamacare where we find the damage,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with jurisdiction over Obamacare, said at the start of a hearing Wednesday on the individual insurance market. “. . . No one is talking about repealing anything until there is a concrete alternative in its place.”\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME), a moderate who has been promoting a Solomon-like compromise that would allow the states to choose whether to stick with the existing Obamacare law or opt for a different approach, said at the same hearing that “Regardless of who was elected President, we were going to have to do major repairs on the Affordable Care Act.”\n\nRep. Greg Walden (R-OR), the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who has major responsibility for shaping new health care policy, offered a similar message to reporters the previous day, according to The Hill. “We’re going to fix things; we’re going to repair things,” he said.\n\nBut with Trump insisting that the Republican-controlled Congress simultaneously repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act to a radically different, more market-based approach, congressional Republicans are in no way off the hook. Conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation are pressing the GOP to make good on their campaign pledges to repeal Obamacare early this year, and some members of the House Freedom Caucus are behind that strategy.\n\nTrump and GOP leaders have already acknowledged there are portions of the Obamacare law that they would like to preserve, most notably a ban on insurers discriminating against applicants who have pre-existing health problems and a provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement\n\nShortly after he was sworn in Jan. 20, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies with jurisdiction to do everything they can within the law to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”\n\nTrump appears to have no understanding of the complexity and perils of designing a replacement for a major federal health care program – especially one that has grown in popularity even as the new administration moves aggressively to eviscerate it. A recent Fox News poll found that 50 percent of voters feel favorable about Obamacare – a nine-point uptick from last summer.\n\nMeanwhile, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released in early January found that 75 percent of Americans either are opposed to repealing the Affordable Care Act or want Congress to have an acceptable replacement in hand before they go ahead and repeal the current law.\n\n“Republican leadership is moving to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it,” Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said today at a hearing. “Thirty-two million people will lose health coverage, premiums will double, and we will return to the days when insurance companies decide who lives and who dies.”\n\nRelated: Here’s the Problem With Trump’s Plan to Sell Health Insurance Across State Lines\n\nIn recent days, there have been reports across the country of Republican lawmakers ducking meeting with constituents who are worried about losing their health insurance coverage. The Aurora Beacon News reported that staffers of Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) canceled a scheduled meeting Wednesday with 16 constituents concerned about the repeal of Obamacare after Roskam’s staff members realized a reporter was present.\n\nMeaghan Smith, a spokesperson for the Protect Our Care Coalition, said in a statement that “People are scared about what will happen to their health care if Republicans blow up our health care system. And Republicans can’t hide from the reality that they simply have no plan.”\n\nCongressional Republicans only have themselves to blame. After six years of denouncing Obamacare as a failed venture that has wasted billions of federal dollars and has fallen far short of Obama’s promise to provide affordable health insurance, Republicans have yet to agree on a replacement plan that would stand a good chance of working – or passing muster with Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said today that the Republicans shift to a “repair and fix” theme marks their “realization at long last that they’re going to have to get Democratic votes in the Senate.”\n\n“So this moderation of language – that’s a minimum first step,” Antos said."

    "text": "When a relatively obscure arm of the Treasury Department, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, issued a release on Thursday that made it easier for some U.S. companies to do business with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), there was a rash of ominous suggestions on social media that this was the beginning of a Trump administration rollback of the sanctions that President Obama imposed on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine and, later, for interfering in the U.S. elections.\n\nNow, given President Trump’s apparent fondness for Russian President Vladimir Putin, there are certainly many who expect a significant reduction in sanctions aimed at the Russian Federation. But, according to an international trade law expert, that’s not what’s happening here.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nThursday’s move is really just meant to cure an unintended consequence of an order signed late in December that was preventing U.S. companies from exporting computer software that contains encryption capabilities to Russia.\n\nIn December, after intelligence agencies in the U.S. determined that not only had Russia attempted to interfere with the November presidential election but that the order had been given from the very top of the Kremlin, Obama took steps to further strengthen existing sanctions. One of those moves was the addition of the FSB to the list of entities that U.S. persons, businesses and particularly financial institutions are barred from doing business with.\n\nThe problem for U.S. software and technology firms is that in order to sell products containing encryption software in Russia, it is necessary to buy a license. And the licenses are sold by the FSB. That meant that U.S. computer firms and others were unable to buy the required licenses and, therefore, were being shut out of the Russian market.\n\nRelated: Gen. Petraeus Says The Post-War Order Is in Danger of Collapse\n\n“This simply addresses this unintended consequence that actually harms U.S. businesses,” said Douglas N. Jacobson, an international trade attorney with the law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley in Washington. “That was not what this was intended to do. OFAC didn’t even realize that U.S. companies had to obtain this authorization from Russia to import their products.”\n\nThe order issued Thursday is extremely narrow in scope, he said, allowing transactions with the FSB solely for the purchase of the necessary import licenses and capping annual expenditures for those licenses at $5,000 per company.\n\nAnd to be clear, Jacobson said, the licenses that companies are being allowed to purchase aren’t for selling the kind of high-level security software that could, say, protect a major U.S. political party from being hacked by Russia. The software in question is much more pedestrian.\n\n“It’s things like Microsoft Word,” he said. “Really any Microsoft product.”"

    "text": "The company that makes Budweiser — the popular brew that rebranded itself as “America” last summer — appears to be wading into the nation’s immigration debate in the wake of President Trump’s travel ban last week.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev on Wednesday released a 60-second Super Bowl commercial focused on the company’s founder, German immigrant Adolphus Busch. The ad follows Busch as he travels from his native country to St. Louis, where he fatefully meets his future father-in-law Eberhard Anheuser — also German-born, and the eventual co-founder of the iconic brewing company.\n\nRelated: 55 Major US Companies Founded by Immigrants\n\nThe ad includes dialogue such as, “You don’t look like you’re from around here” and “Go back home,” while showing a journey fraught with struggles, echoing the challenges faced by refugees and immigrants today.\n\nAt the end of the ad, Anheuser orders a beer for Busch, calling him “my friend,” marking the start of a relationship that eventually leads to the creation of the largest American beer maker. (Anheuser-Busch became a Belgian-owned company in 2008 after InBev bought the company for $52 billion.)\n\nThe commercial highlights the positive impact that many immigrants have had on the U.S., while the current conversation about immigration is centered largely on terrorism or how undocumented workers are taking U.S. jobs.\n\nThere’s data to back up the economic message of the commercial, too. A study last year from the National Foundation for American Policy found that immigrants started more than half of the 87 U.S.-based startups worth $1 billion or more, including WeWork, Moderna Therapeutics and SpaceX. Their companies on average employed 760 workers.\n\nThe founders hail from India, Israel, Iraq, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, among 15 other countries around the world. About a quarter of the founders first came to the U.S. as international students.\n\nThis is hardly a new phenomenon, as the Budweiser ad shows. Another study from Partnership for a New American Economy found that almost a fifth of Fortune 500 companies in 2010 were founded by immigrants, many of them as far back as the 19th century. (Notable example: Communications giant AT&T traces its roots to the Bell Telephone Company, founded by Scottish immigrant Alexander Graham Bell.)\n\nRelated: After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream\n\nAnother fifth of the companies were founded by children of immigrants, such as Apple’s Steve Jobs, whose parents came from Syria, one of the country’s affected by President Trump’s recent travel ban. Bob Miner, founder of Oracle, had parents who emigrated from Iran.\n\nIn total, immigrants or children of immigrants founded 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies, employing 3.6 million people at the time, with combined revenue of $4.2 trillion.\n\nMany of these companies are American business icons, including McDonald’s (child of immigrant), Ford (child of immigrant) and Google (immigrant founder).

    "text": "A swirl of confusing leaks from the White House about President Trump’s contentious interactions with the leaders of some of the country’s closest allies, and accusations by anonymous sources in the military that a fatal raid in Yemen was undertaken without adequate preparation are all contributing to a growing sense of chaos inside a Trump administration that hasn’t yet reached the two-week mark in its four-year term.\n\nCompounding the tension in Washington was the administration’s vague threat of impending action against Iran over that country’s recent test of a ballistic missile and the actions of rebels it is supporting in Yemen.\n\nRelated: After Three Years of Extreme Vetting, I Nearly Gave Up on My American Dream\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Washington Post revealed that Trump had an extremely contentious call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last weekend, in which the president -- in between boasts about his election victory -- berated Turnbull over an agreement the Obama administration reached with Canberra to accept 1,250 refugees currently detained offshore by Australian authorities.\n\nReporting byThe Washington Post and Australian news outlets described a tense and at times angry conversation that Trump told Turnbull was “the worst call by far” he has had with a foreign leader.\n\nTrump appeared to confirm that he was upset with the deal late Wednesday night, tweeting out, “Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!”\n\nThe reported call has caused political havoc for Turnbull in Australia, a country that has long been one of the United States’ closest and most reliable allies.\n\nRelated: How Long Can Trump Tolerate the ‘President Bannon’ Headlines?\n\nConflicting reports also arose late Wednesday about Trump’s conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the weekend. The Associated Press initially reported that it had been provided a transcript of part of the conversation in which Trump took the Mexican president to task for not addressing drug violence strongly enough in his country.\n\n“You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,” Trump allegedly said. “You aren't doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.”\n\nThe story immediately blew up on social media, because it gave the impression that Trump had, in effect, threatened to invade the United States’ southern neighbor and third largest trading partner.\n\nA few hours later, CNN offered a different version of the story, reporting that what the AP reviewed had apparently been part of a White House staff-written “readout” of the conversation. The real transcript, part of which the network said it was provided, showed that Trump had not threatened to send US troops into Mexico, but had offered Pena Nieto military assistance if he needed it.\n\nRelated: The Emerging Arms Race at Sea for the US, China and Russia\n\nAccording to CNN, the transcript has Trump saying, “You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out.”\n\nThis is, to put it plainly, bizarre. “Readouts” of presidential conversations with world leaders are sanitized summaries of calls, in which a shouting match is reduced to a “frank exchange of ideas” and an outright threat becomes one of “various options” that were discussed. What they never do is try to escalate an already tense situation.\n\nWhy a readout that so grossly misrepresented the president’s words would have been created in the first place is mysterious. That it would have been leaked to the press is closer to incomprehensible.\n\nAs if reports of Trump treating leaders of the country’s closest allies like hotel suppliers who displeased him weren’t alarming enough, Reuters early Thursday reported that senior military officials are claiming that a disastrous raid in Yemen last week that killed a Navy SEAL, wounded several other Americans, and took the lives of an unknown number of civilians was approved without sufficient planning.\n\nRelated: China Just Gave Trump a 999-Foot-Long Middle Finger\n\nAccording to the news agency: “U.S. military officials told Reuters that Trump approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations. As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.”\n\nThese claims raise a number of troubling questions, chief among them being why military officials would even ask permission to undertake an operation that they saw as ill-conceived in the first place. It suggests that either the Trump administration was pressuring the Pentagon into taking actions it wasn’t prepared for, or that military officials are throwing the White House under the bus for a botched operation they don’t want to take the blame for. Neither is a particularly encouraging scenario.\n\nAll this came after a day in which Trump’s controversial National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room Wednesday afternoon to tell reporters that the administration was “officially putting Iran on notice” over what he described as violations of a United Nations resolution affirming a deal to shut down its nuclear program and attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen who receive backing from Tehran.\n\nHowever, Flynn abruptly left the podium before elaborating on what it meant to put Iran “officially on notice” leaving it to Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said only that the US would not “sit by and not act on those actions.”\n\nBy the end of the day, there had still been no clarification of what, if any, steps the administration is considering.\n\nNevertheless, the administration sent out its surrogates to insist that the move had been a success.\n\nSebastian Gorka, an assistant to the president, appeared on Fox News channel’s Sean Hannity program to claim that the vague threat was actually “deadly clear.”\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\n“We don’t have a national security team made up of 28-year-old grad school students who have degrees in fictional writing. We have a very serious national security team,” Gorka said, apparently in reference to one of former president Obama’s close advisers. “We sent a very clear message. We recognize that Iran is not just another country. It's not Belgium, it's not Trinidad and Tobago. It is a state sponsor of terrorism that is destabilizing the region. We have to send a message, and I think the message was sent.”\n\nTrump himself addressed the issue early Thursday morning in a pair of tweets, writing, “Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion.”\n\nBut he also offered no clear indication of what actions the White House is planning to take."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/02/02/Trump-May-Try-Weed-Out-Immigrants-Who-Cost-Taxpayers-279-Billion-Annually",
    "text": "Last fall, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a massive report that attempted to answer questions that have bedeviled the debate over immigration policy for years: Are immigrants living and working in the U.S. both legally and illegally a net plus or minus for the economy? And do they pose a serious drain on government services and welfare?\n\nOn the first question, the report found that illegal immigrants have had “an overall positive impact” on long-term economic growth, with little evidence that they have significantly depressed the wages of native-born workers with a high-school education or less. Overall, the economy benefitted from an expanding population and more jobs, and businesses frequently took advantage of a flood of cheap labor into the market.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban: Trump's Immigration Ban Is Bad for Business\n\nBut on the second question, the researchers found that the United States is saddled with a $279 billion annual “fiscal burden,” or the difference between tax revenues collected from first-generation immigrants and their families and the value of the social services they used. The average per capita government outlay was $15,908, according to the report, compared with per capita tax receipts of only $10,887.\n\nThe report by 20 prominent social scientists and economists left little doubt that that the nation’s 55.5 million immigrants – both legal and illegal – weren’t paying nearly enough in taxes to cover their use of public services.\n\nWhile millions of undocumented immigrants have paid billions of dollars in taxes into federal, state and local coffers -- as immigration advocacy groups frequently point out -- anti-immigrant forces on Capitol Hill and now in the White House have dismissed these immigrants as freeloaders who are excessively utilizing public schools, health care and food stamps while taking away jobs from native Americans. Although jobs may not be affected nearly as much as some may think, the federal budget does take a big hit.\n\nThese and other findings are important grist in an immigration debate that has gone viral in the past week and a half, as newly ensconced President Donald Trump has delayed entry for refugees and travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries and is setting in motion a crackdown on illegal immigrants in this country that will likely lead to more deportations in the coming months.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nTrump’s surprise executive order last week that touched off chaos and confusion in airports around the country and overseas apparently was just the first installment in a series of actions designed to make good on his campaign pledge to rid the U.S. of as many as 11 million illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the administration is also considering a plan to “weed out would-be immigrants who are likely to require public assistance,” as well as targeting illegal immigrants who are already living in the U.S. and making use of taxpayer-funded social and health care programs for deportation.\n\nMany of those immigrants have little if any formal education and lack skills to obtain better-paying jobs, according to the National Academies of Science report. As a result, many of their children are on welfare and school lunch programs, placing a burden on state and local social services. Not surprisingly, the fiscal drain is felt most heavily by states with large populations of illegal immigrants.\n\nCalifornia, for example, struggles with an $18.9 billion annual fiscal drain. Texas ranks second nationally with a $7.8 billion fiscal deficit because of excessive demands by immigrants on social services, medical facilities and schools.\n\nRelated: Obama’s Action Gives Illegal Immigrants Billions in Tax Credits\n\nThe report indicated that over time, the fiscal burden will shrink to as little as $43.4 billion a year, as the second-generation immigrants who are better educated and trained than their parents pay more into the tax system to defray the cost of social services. But those projections are contingent on varying assumptions about the future education level of immigrants, government-spending levels and tax rates.\n\nThe Washington Post and VOX have both reported obtaining drafts of a second executive order that would target immigrants attempting to enter the country or are living here legally on the basis of their prospects for getting and holding a job and making minimal use of social services.\n\n“Our country’s immigration laws are designed to protect American taxpayers and promote immigrant self-sufficiency,” stated the draft of the order obtained by The Post. “Yet households headed by aliens are much more likely than those headed by citizens to use Federal means-tested public benefits.”\n\nA second order in draft stage calls for the elimination of the “jobs magnet” that is motivating illegal immigrants to come to the U.S., according to the newspaper. The proposed order would rescind any work visa provisions for foreign nationals that are found not to be in “the national interest” or deemed to be in violation of U.S. immigration law.\n\nRelated: Outraged Over $23 Billion in Wrongful Tax Credits? Blame Congress\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the proposed draft orders. For now, at least, there is no clear evidence the administration intends to move ahead with them. However, as The Post noted, longstanding federal law already makes it more difficult for non-citizens to obtain most forms of public assistance.\n\nStill, a September 2015 analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies showed that 51 percent of immigrant-headed households used at least one federal welfare program — cash, food, housing, or medical care — compared to 30 percent of native households. A follow-up report showed that the average immigrant household “consumes 33 percent more cash welfare, 57 percent more food assistance and 44 percent more Medicaid dollars” than the average native household.\n\nBut economists and policy experts differ on the degree of immigrant dependence on government social and health care programs. And even some supporters of Trump’s get-tough policies against illegal immigrants question whether the draft executive orders circulating in Washington would be practical or in keeping with American values.\n\nSteven A. Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates limits on immigration, said that the Trump administration appears to be addressing “an important principle” of immigrants’ excessive dependence on social services. However, he argued that there is no way that the government could accurately gauge the likelihood of immigrants allowed into the country being financially independent.\n\nRelated: Could Trump’s Attack on Sanctuary Cities Trigger a Tax Revolt?\n\n“The problem here is, imagine a person comes to the United States and gets hurt,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Are we not going to take care of them? We might deny them Medicaid, but are we going to keep them out of the hospitals or emergency rooms or long-term care?”\n\n“Or somebody comes to the United States and they lose their job,” Camarota added. “They have a kid. We’re not going to give them food stamps? We’re just going to let the kid starve? We’re not going to give the kid a free lunch? Really?”\n\nWhile there may be better ways to screen low-income applicants for visas to enter the country, Camarota said, he doesn’t favor cutting off welfare to immigrants in need. And targeting for deportation immigrants legally residing in the United States for using too many government services doesn’t appear to be doable – or legal.\n\n“The problem is that if you allow in a lot of poor people, you’re going to get a lot of welfare use,” he said. “It’s just very hard to imagine our society [cutting benefits] after the fact.”"

    "title": "Republicans Exhale With Trump’s Supreme Court Choice of Gorsuch",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/02/Republicans-Exhale-Trump-s-Supreme-Court-Choice-Gorsuch",
    "text": "“Think of the Supreme Court,” the Republican Party repeatedly urged skeptics of Donald Trump during the general election in 2016. Conservatives who found themselves lost at sea in a cycle dominated by grassroots populism and the tenacious popularity of the billionaire candidate riding its wave fretted whether they would find themselves locked out, regardless of which candidate won the election. Republican leaders and the Trump campaign insisted that conservatives had only one chance left to save the Supreme Court from a progressive takeover, and eventually conservatives cast their bets on Trump.\n\nThis week, that bet paid off – and perhaps more robustly than conservatives might have hoped. Trump had long pledged to name his first Supreme Court pick from a list of 21 names, consisting of well-regarded judicial conservatives that had been recommended from sources like the Heritage Foundation and activists with whom the campaign consulted. Still, having been burned in the past on nominees from better-established politicians – such as George H. W. Bush’s appointment of David Souter or George W. Bush’s initial selection of Harriet Miers – many conservatives had low expectations that Trump would stick to his list once the political realities of Washington DC emerged.\n\nRelated: The GOP May Get a Taste of Its Own Medicine on Supreme Court Nominations\n\nInstead, Trump fulfilled his campaign promise, even while doing so in a nod to his reality-show past. The president invited his two finalists to Washington but introduced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee. Gorsuch represents precisely what conservatives most want in a Supreme Court justice: conservative, dedicated to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, and scholarly enough to have a track record of writings that allow supporters to believe that he will remain in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia rather than “grow” in his office – to the Left.\n\nFurthermore, Gorsuch offers the promise of a very long tenure on the bench at his present age of 49. Despite his youth, Gorsuch has spent a decade on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals after having been appointed by the younger Bush, which gives him an unassailable resumé for the job. In fact, Gorsuch was already such an impressive figure at the time of his 2006 nomination to the appellate bench that Senate Democrats waived a roll-call vote and allowed Gorsuch to be confirmed by universal acclamation\n\nFor that reason, Trump’s choice is a stroke of genius that will make it much more difficult to obstruct the confirmation. The Senate still allows for filibusters on Supreme Court confirmations, but Democrats must have 41 of their caucus to sustain one in the event of a floor vote. Despite anger over the blocking of Merrick Garland last year, when Senate Republicans refused to take up Barack Obama’s choice for Scalia’s replacement, Senate Democrats don’t appear to have the numbers to block Gorsuch. A press release from the conservative activist group America Squared on Wednesday notes that eight Democrats have already gone on record supporting a floor vote, which would give Republicans the 60 votes they need to proceed to confirmation by a simple majority.\n\nRelated: Potentially Nasty Fight Looms Over Trump U.S. Supreme Court Pick\n\nNor is this the only victory that conservatives have seen in the first two weeks of the Trump era, or perhaps more accurately, since the election. Having been freed up from the need to overcome filibusters on his Cabinet appointments, Trump nominated serious conservatives in policy posts – Tom Price to Health and Human Services, Betsy DeVos to Education, Scott Pruitt to the Environmental Protection Agency, and Rick Perry to Energy, among others.\n\nHis very first executive order on Inauguration Day started the rollback of Obamacare; others soon followed that froze federal hiring, reduced red tape on regulatory burdens on manufacturing, and restarted the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects favored by conservatives and unions alike.\n\nMany on the right wondered just how deep Trump’s commitment to the pro-life movement would run. On his first full business day in office, Trump reinstated the “Mexico City” policy that bars federal funds to organizations that promote or provide abortions abroad, and sent Vice President Mike Pence to the March for Life – the first time a sitting vice president has spoken at the 44-year annual protest march against Roe v. Wade.\n\nRelated: Trump Would Favor Senate Rule Change If Supreme Court Choice Blocked\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump would often claim that America would start winning so much that we would get “sick of winning.” Before the first fortnight of his presidency has passed, conservatives – even those who opposed Trump or viewed his potential with significant skepticism – have to acknowledge that they’ve been on a solid winning streak so far, as early #NeverTrump commentator Erick Erickson did. “If you’re a Trump critic from the right and can’t bring yourself to even thank him for Gorsuch,” Erickson tweeted after the Supreme Court nomination announcement, “at this point, you’re just an ill-mannered ass.”\n\nThat streak won’t last forever, of course. Trump has plans for infrastructure spending that will generate opposition from fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks, and the pressing need for comprehensive entitlement reform will get back-burnered for at least a few more years. However, Trump has at least established his credibility on honoring commitments to voters, especially with conservatives who only reluctantly rallied to his banner.\n\nThat alone will earn Trump maneuvering room on these other issues, and could unite the Republican base more strongly than since the passage of Obamacare seven years ago. And that should have Democrats facing a potential disaster in 2018 worried that their own losing streak will just get longer and longer."

    "text": "Retired Gen. David Petraeus told Congress on Wednesday that the US shouldn't take the existing international order for granted.\n\nThe former CIA director told the House Armed Services Committee that the post-World War II world order had begun to face an \"unprecedented threat from multiple directions.\"\n\nRelated: The Emerging Arms Race at Sea for the US, China and Russia\n\n\"Americans should not take the current international order for granted,\" Petraeus said. \"It did not will itself into existence. We created it. Likewise, it is not naturally self-sustaining. We have sustained it. If we stop doing so, it will fray and, eventually, collapse.\"\n\nThe retired four-star general, who commanded forces in Iraq and later headed the CIA before resigning because of a scandal in which he was found to have shared classified information with his biographer and former mistress, was one of President Donald Trump's picks for secretary of state.\n\nDuring his testimony to the House committee, he warned against isolationism and protectionism, which the new administration's policies support, instead advocating the kind of promotion of democracy around the world that the US has engaged in since World War II.\n\n\"To keep the peace, we led an effort to establish a system of global alliances and security commitments underwritten by US military power and the deployment of our forces to bases in Europe and Asia,\" Petraeus said.\n\n\"To create a foundation for prosperity, we put in place an open, free, and rules-based economic order intended to safeguard against the spiral of protectionism that produced the impoverishment and radicalization of the 1930s. And to protect freedom here at home, we adopted a foreign policy that sought to protect and, where possible, promote freedom abroad along with human rights and rule of law.\"\n\nRelated: Trump’s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nPetraeus called that system imperfect but largely successful. He named familiar adversaries like Russia, China, Iran, and Islamic extremists but said the most harmful threat was actually domestic.\n\n\"The world order has also been undermined by something perhaps even more pernicious — a loss of self-confidence, resolve, and strategic clarity on America's part about our vital interest in preserving and protecting the system we sacrificed so much to bring into being and have sacrificed so much to preserve,\" he said.\n\nPetraeus also warned about how he believed the collapse of institutions like the NATO military alliance and the European Union could play into Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand.\n\n\"President Putin, for instance, understands that, while conventional aggression may occasionally enable Russia to grab a bit of land on its periphery, the real center of gravity is the political will of major democratic powers to defend Euro-Atlantic institutions like NATO and the EU,\" he said. \"That is why Russia is tenaciously working to sow doubt about the legitimacy of these institutions and our entire democratic way of life.\"\n\nTrump made waves in January by repeating his assertions that NATO was \"obsolete\" and remarking that the EU's future didn't matter much to the US.\n\nPetraeus also subtly rebuked the direction the Trump administration had taken on the fight against Islamic extremism, with which Petraeus has much experience.\n\nTrump on Friday signed an executive order temporarily barring immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. The order applies to citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, countries that the White House cited the Obama administration as having once flagged as \"countries of particular concern.\"\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nTerrorism experts have argued that this will feed into the narratives of terrorist groups that claim the US is against Islam while doing little to prevent terrorist attacks inside the country.\n\n\"Islamic extremists want to portray this fight as a clash of civilizations, with America at war against Islam,\" he said. \"We must not let them do that — indeed, we must be very sensitive to actions that might give them ammunition to use in such an effort.\"\n\nPetraeus urged the US to align itself with the Muslim community rather than against it.\n\n\"The most important ally in this war is the overwhelming majority of Muslims who reject Al Qaeda, Daesh, and their fanatical, barbaric worldview,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State terrorist group. \"Indeed, it is millions of Muslims who are fighting and dying in the greatest numbers on the frontlines of this war.\"\n\nHe noted Arab and Kurdish soldiers who are fighting ISIS, Gulf Arab fighters who are pushing back Al Qaeda in Yemen, Afghans who are fighting a resurgent Taliban in their country, and Somali forces who are fighting terrorist elements there.\n\nPetraeus' warnings matched those given by other experts, former government officials, and world leaders.\n\nLast month, Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at the policies Trump had proposed, saying the EU had been an \"indispensable partner of the United States.\"\n\n\"Defending the liberal international order requires that we resist the forces of European disintegration and maintain our longstanding insistence on a Europe whole, free, and at peace,\" he said.\n\nEuropean leaders have also expressed concerns about Trump's views on NATO and the EU.\n\nAnd earlier this week, the president of the European Council of the EU warned that Trump could pose a threat to the stability of the bloc.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.

Unlike its first, the Liaoning, which was bought from Ukraine and retrofitted, the new ship – dubbed the Shandong, after a Chinese province – will be built locally in the port of Dalian.\n\nLast month, in what was seen as a provocative gesture toward Taiwan and the U.S., the Liaoning and multiple escort warships cruised through the Taiwan Strait.\n\nRelations between China and the U.S. have been strained since the president of Taiwan called Donald Trump after he was elected to offer her congratulations; Beijing viewed the exchange as a violation of the “One China” policy in place since 1979.\n\nIn separate news Wednesday, Reuters also reports that Russia is building three more nuclear icebreakers in a move to strengthen its presence in the Arctic as it vies for dominance there with the U.S., Canada, Norway and newcomer China. Reuters said Russia already has about 40 icebreakers, six of them nuclear-powered.\n\nRelated: The US Navy’s $13 Billion Answer to China and Russia\n\nAt stake in the Arctic are vast reserves of gas and oil.

It could trigger an arms race.\" And just-installed U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis reportedly referred to Russia’s Arctic moves as “aggressive steps” in a written submission to senators considering his nomination.\n\nIt is probably not a coincidence that the U.S. has sent about 300 Marines to Norway for a six-month deployment – the first foreign troops on its soil since World War II.\n\nIn addition, America already has a sea lane full of new ships on the way: The Navy recently announced that its latest supercarrier, the $13 billion USS Gerald R.

The Ford will be one of nine new vessels the Navy is adding in 2017.\n\nRelated: The Navy Commissions Its Super Stealthy $4.4 Billion Destroyer\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump called for a 350-ship fleet, but the Navy has gone even further. In a “force assessment” report last December, a summary of which was obtained by Bloomberg, the Navy called for 355 vessels.\n\nBloomberg said that the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service “estimates a 350-ship Navy would cost an average $4 billion extra annually over the current forecast of about $16.3 billion a year for new ship construction through 2021.”"

    "text": "There is mounting speculation that Senate Republicans will invoke the “nuclear option” and change the rules to prevent Democrats from filibustering President Trump’s nomination of federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\nEven before Trump formally announced his choice of Gorsuch at a White House ceremony Tuesday night, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and his colleagues declared that Gorsuch’s conservative judicial record was outside the “legal mainstream” and warned that their party may end up blocking the nomination, which will require at least 60 votes to pass in a chamber where the GOP currently holds a 52 to 48 seat majority.\n\nRelated: Trump’s SCOTUS Nomination: One Way or the Other, This Ends Badly\n\nIf Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) ultimately decides to pull the pin on the “nuclear option” by changing the Senate rules to require just a simple majority to approve a Supreme Court nomination, Democrats and their allies warn that all hell will break loose on the Senate floor.\n\nBut while that possibility is weeks or even months away from fruition, we’re already seeing miniature versions of nuclear warfare—a strategy implemented by then Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who bypassed the GOP House to approve Obama’s judicial nominees. If eliminating the filibuster in the case of Supreme Court nominations is considered the ICBM of political options, there are already tactical nukes going off throughout the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a major show of force, Senate Finance Committee Republicans led by chair Orrin Hatch of Utah rammed through the highly controversial nominations of Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) as secretary of health and human services and Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary without a single Democratic member present.\n\nFor the second day in a row, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and other Democrats boycotted the Finance Committee session to delay action on the two nominations, demanding further probing of allegations of ethical breaches and improper stock transactions.\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Treasury Pick Wants to Increase the Power of the IRS\n\nPrice’s $300,000 worth of investments in health care-related companies has sparked Democratic criticism that he engaged in insider trading as a member of the Ways and Means health subcommittee and gave misleading testimony about his involvement in what amounted to a sweetheart stock deal with an Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics.\n\nMnuchin, the wealthy businessman, meanwhile got into trouble by understating his personal wealth on a financial disclosure form and then gave misleading testimony before the committee on how a bank he once headed, OneWest Bank, scrutinized mortgage documents.\n\nBy unanimous consent, the Republicans gathered in the Finance Committee hearing room this morning, agreed to change the committee’s standing rules, which require at least one member of each party to be in attendance for committee work to proceed. “It’s just another way of roughing up the president’s nominees,” Hatch complained. “They have been treated fairly. We have not been treated fairly.”\n\nWyden told reporters, “We made it clear yesterday that when we got answers to these questions, we’re ready to move ahead,” adding that “We’re going to keep pushing to get the facts.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nThose nominations now head to the Senate floor, which has become a cauldron of controversy over the qualifications of Trump’s cabinet picks and his executive order last week imposing a travel ban to the United States for refugees and foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. “It is time to get over the fact that they lost the election,” McConnell scolded the Democrats. “The president is entitled to have his cabinet appointments considered. None of this is going to lead to a different outcome.”\n\nSchumer and the Democrats have no way of permanently blocking Trump’s choices for Cabinet posts, and practically all should eventually make it through the process. So far, however, only three of Trump’s 15 nominees have won confirmation by the Senate: Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security secretary John Kelly and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nThat leaves some of Trump’s most controversial nominees for clearance, including restaurant businessman Andy Puzder for labor secretary, billionaire Republican operative Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) to head the Office of Management and Budget, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be the next Attorney General.\n\nBy this time eight years ago, former President Barack Obama had won Senate confirmation of practically all 15 of his cabinet picks.\n\nSenate Republicans’ decision to play hardball in forcing through Trump’s nominees comes at a time when partisan rancor on Capitol Hill is reaching a boiling point. Hatch, the Finance Committee chair, on Tuesday went after Democrats on the committee in unusually angry language on the first day of their boycott.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices – but Can He Do It?\n\n“Well, they are idiots,” Hatch said. “It’s just complete breach of decorum, a complete breach of committee rules, a complete breach of just getting along around here.”\n\nIn an extraordinary showdown in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken accused Sessions of misrepresenting his record on civil rights. He also accused fellow Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas of abetting the deception.\n\nThis led to an intensely angry exchange between Franken and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Majority Whip, that came right before a final 11 to 9 party-line vote that sent Sessions’ nomination for attorney general to the full Senate. The hearing was also disrupted by protesters decrying Sessions’ civil rights record.\n\nThe intrusion of protesters into the hearing gives a clue as Democrats’ motives for ramping up opposition to Trump’s picks, from cabinet nominees to an expected filibuster of Gorsuch, the Federal Appeals Court judge who the president nominated to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night: Their voter base is furious.\n\nAlready mad about an election in which Trump won the presidency despite a decisive popular vote loss, Democrats’ anger only surged as Trump rolled out cabinet picks that, at times, seemed intended to provoke them. He wants to place a climate change denier at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency, and an advocate of abolishing the minimum wage at the Labor Department. His nominee to run the Department of Education has no background in public education aside from longstanding support of plans to privatize it.\n\nHundreds of thousands of marchers advocating women’s rights descended on the capital just 24 hours after Trump was sworn in. Seven days later, when the administration announced an executive order banning refugees from entering the country and restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, mass protests erupted in the streets of major American cities.\n\nProminent activists began delivering the message to Democrats in no uncertain terms: the only acceptable response to the Trump presidency is resistance.\n\nBen Wikler, Washington director of the liberal group Moveon.org, told Real Clear Politics that Democrats who don’t fight back against Trump will face a “firestorm” of criticism. “The anti-Trump resistance is going to make the Tea Party seem like a tempest in a teapot,” he added.\n\nThere were plenty of high profile vows to mount primary challenges against any Democrats who offer support or cover to Trump on nominees like Sessions or Gorsuch.\n\nSenate Dems, let's be very clear: You will filibuster & block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election. — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 1, 2017\n\nAnd the partisan warfare seems only likely to escalate. On Wednesday morning, Trump went before the television cameras and said that if Gorsuch faces Democratic resistance in the Senate he wants the Republican Majority to fire their biggest weapon of all: elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees."

    "text": "With President Trump’s announcement that he has chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a judicial conservative from Colorado, to fill the empty seat on the Supreme Court, the stage is set for a confirmation drama that will play out over the next weeks and months in the Senate and in the media. Like any good drama, it will be packed with soaring soliloquies and moments of low humor.\n\nBut whether Gorsuch is ultimately confirmed or not, the story will end with one of the two major parties claiming that they have been grossly mistreated, insisting that permanent damage has been done to the structure of American democracy.\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Treasury Pick Wants to Increase the Power of the IRS\n\nGorsuch, a widely respected jurist who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, is pro-life and pro-religious liberty. He is seen at least as conservative as the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill. His confirmation will bring the court back to the same right-of-center balance that existed prior to Scalia’s death.\n\nBut Democrats have long signaled that they view the seat as “stolen” because of the extraordinary refusal of Senate Republicans to even consider former president Barack Obama’s nominee for the court, Judge Merrick Garland, a moderate who was viewed by partisans on both sides of the aisle as an exceptionally well-qualified candidate.\n\nFor almost a year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other senior Republicans in the chamber refused to move forward on Garland’s nomination, claiming that because the primary campaigns had already started, the next president should choose the next chief justice. But now they are calling on Democrats to quickly approve Gorsuch who had been approved unanimously by the Senate when he was appointed to the 10th Circuit.\n\nMcConnell, who tortured precedent and fact to construct an argument that Obama was not entitled to name a Supreme Court justice in his final year in office, is now arguing that because Trump is in his first term, he deserves more deference than Republicans offered Obama in his last.\n\n“I hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up-or-down vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four first-term nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,” McConnell said.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nBut senior Senate Democrats are not in a forgiving mood, a fact they signaled by refusing Trump’s invitation to attend the announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination at the White House last night. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promised “exhaustive” inquiries into his record of legal decisions.\n\n“Now more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights, and will stand up to a President who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,” he said in a statement.\n\nHe added, “Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard. Judge Gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated hostility toward women’s rights, and most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent Justice on the Court.”\n\nSome Democrats and liberal advocacy groups aren’t even waiting for hearings. In fact, they didn’t wait for a name before demanding that the party goes to war over the nomination and block Gorsuch with a filibuster.\n\nRelated: Trump Moves Quickly on Pledge to Contain Drug Prices – but Can He Do It?\n\nOn the right, from Trump on down, Republicans are calling on McConnell to use the “nuclear option” -- changing the Senate’s rules to allow debate on a Supreme Court nominee to be shut down by a simple majority rather than the 60-vote threshold. His predecessor, Democrat Harry Reid, used the nuclear option to confirm Obama judicial nominees obstructed by Republicans, but would not go so far as eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court picks.\n\nBoth parties in the Senate face some tricky decisions.\n\nTo successfully filibuster Gorsuch, the Democrats would need 41 of the 48 members of their caucus to agree to block a vote on him. However, some are going to be hesitant or outright unwilling to go along. Between actual Democrats and the two Independents who caucus with them, the minority will have a combined 25 seats to defend in the 2018 election, representing more than half of their strength in the Senate. Many of those seats are in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, and Indiana, which Trump carried in the 2016 election.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, whose state also went for Trump, has already signaled that he will not support a filibuster.\n\nRelated: The Top Threat to the US Economy? A Trump Trade War\n\nIf faced with Democratic obstruction, Republicans will feel pressure to do away with the filibuster for Supreme Court judges entirely. That will be its own kind of struggle because the party was unanimous in its cries of rage and betrayal when Reid nuked it over lower court judges in 2013.\n\nMcConnell, in need of a 51-vote majority (and with Vice President Mike Pence able to weigh in and break a tie in the Republicans’ favor), cannot afford to lose more than two members of his caucus if he opts to try to force through a rule change. It’s possible, though by no means certain, that some members of the body with long memories of being in the minority, will be unwilling to strip Democrats of one of the few levers of power they control, knowing that the pendulum always swings back eventually.\n\nEither way, this will end badly.\n\nIf Gorsuch is strong-armed onto the court, a very large segment of the Democratic base will view him as illegitimate -- the occupant of a “stolen” chair -- and will question any conservative rulings from the court that relied on his vote.\n\nIf Gorsuch has his nomination blocked, Republicans will howl about Democrats’ intransigence, and many will seek ways to further limit the power of the minority in the future, increasing pressure on any holdouts to take the more extreme position on the nuclear option in the future.\n\nIt’s very hard to see an ending to this play in which both sides emerge satisfied that their rights have been respected."

    "text": "California is leading scores of cities and states fighting back against the Trump Administration’s executive order seeking to punish them financially for providing safe havens for illegal immigrants threatened with deportation.\n\nJust yesterday, the city of San Francisco filed suit in U.S. District Court in Northern California challenging the legality of last week’s executive order.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nTrump has directed the federal government to withhold federal grants and assistance to “sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents in identifying and detaining illegal immigrants in their custody.\"\n\nThe lawsuit represents the first legal action brought against the Trump administration by a city being targeted for the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal assistance because of their benign, protective treatment of millions of illegal immigrants living throughout the country.\n\nCities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco that offer strong protection to illegal immigrants have the most at stake. San Francisco, for example, receives more than $1.2 billion annually in federal funding, most of which goes to health care, nutrition, and other safety net programs, according to USA Today.\n\n“The president’s executive order is not only unconstitutional, it’s un-American,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. “That is why we must stand up and oppose it. We are a nation of immigrants and a land of laws. We must be the ‘guardians of our democracy’ that President Obama urged us all to be in his farewell address.”\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nTrump is seeking to increase pressure on illegal immigrants and the cities and states protecting them as part of a larger strategy for tightening border security, building a 2,000-mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and rounding up undocumented workers with criminal records for deportation.\n\n“We’re going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters last week. “The American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.”\n\nBut California, with roughly 2.5 million illegal immigrants out of a total population of 39 million, is fighting back to defend the immigration population and protect the estimated $40 billion to $50 billion it receives annually in federal grants and aid. While the administration hasn’t specified where the cuts will be made, community law enforcement, crime victims assistance and first-responder grants from the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security are likely targets.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jerry Brown and the state’s Democratic-controlled General Assembly are mounting a sophisticated legal battle aimed at tying up Trump’s Justice Department in a “myriad” of unending and draining court cases, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRelated: Some Sanctuary City Officials Will Stonewall Trump Over Criminal Deportations\n\nState officials believe they have legal precedent on their side. And the General Assembly recently retained Eric Holder, the former attorney general in the Obama administration to advise the state on legal tactics. Officials believe that Trump and his advisers would be on “shaky legal ground” attempting to cut off any federal funds allocated for anything other than law enforcement, and even then it would be politically risky to strip away funds from local police and crime victims, according to the newspaper.\n\nOthers who are up in arms over Trump’s assault on sanctuary cities are calling for retaliatory action against the new Republican administration that would hit the government in its pocketbook.\n\nTake for example former state Assembly speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., who recently called for a tax rebellion of sorts against the federal government to protest Trump’s executive order.\n\nKPIX 5 TV in San Francisco reported that officials are looking for funds that flow from California to Washington that could be used to effectively offset the potential loss of billions of dollars’ worth of federal funds.\n\n“California could very well become an organized non-payer,” Brown said in an interview with the station aired last Sunday. “They could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code.”\n\nRelated: Is this How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\nBrown didn’t provide specifics for what he has in mind, and state and federal tax experts say they are scratching their heads to figure out what that retaliatory action might entail.\n\nAbout $205 billion flows annually from California to the federal government, but that represents individual and business federal taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury. And billions more go for federal excise and gasoline taxes, but those too aren’t under the control of the state government. So except for a few miscellaneous payments that may go from Sacramento to DC, the state has little leverage over the federal government, experts say.\n\n“I don’t see much in the way of what the state government could stop in terms of going to Washington, D.C.,” Joe Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation,” said in an interview. “Certainly the biggest leverage California has is that they pay $205 billion a year in federal taxes. But the state government is not involved in that. That’s money paid directly by Californians to the federal government.”\n\nHenchman and others see just one other alternative –- a popular uprising by California residents who stage a major protest by withholding their federal tax payments. It would be a sagebrush revolution of sorts, akin to previous tax protests over the years to object to excess government spending or U.S. warfare in Vietnam and the Middle East. But that would be a risky venture that would run afoul of the U.S. tax code and the Internal Revenue Service – and would almost certainly invite steep penalties and potential criminal action.\n\n“I’m not sure citizens would risk jail sentences for that,” said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. “So you would be asking Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg not to pay their federal income taxes.”"

    "text": "I am an Iraqi Muslim who is about to become an American citizen. In July 2011, I boarded a flight to New York City, seated next to an old Iraqi couple. When we landed at JFK, the scene was quite different from what it is today.\n\nAs soon I got off the plane, an Asian-American employee at the International Organization for Migration asked me to wait with the same Iraqi couple I traveled with from Amman, Jordan. Several minutes passed, and then she took me inside the terminal avoiding the long entry lines where hundreds of Americans and foreigners were waiting to be processed by customs.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nixonian Loyalty Test With Travel Ban: Another Display of Incompetence\n\n“Refugee!” she screamed at anyone who tried to stop us. Finally, after passing through several side doors without question, I was handled by one official for a few minutes and then admitted to the United States without even being searched or having my bag searched.\n\nThe whole thing took 20 minutes or maybe a bit more. Nevertheless, these 20 minutes ended a lengthy and thorough three-year vetting process during which I nearly lost hope in the American dream.\n\nI applied for resettlement in the U.S. as part of the so-called Kennedy bill. In 2007, after many Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with the American military in Iraq and Afghanistan as interpreters were killed, the late Senator Edward Kennedy stepped in to help. He sponsored a bill that assigned a section in the defense budget to resettle in the U.S. those of us who worked for U.S. entities in Iraq and Afghanistan for a year or more, along with our families, to protect us from retaliation and to show gratitude.\n\nBy the end of December 2016, the Mideast interpreters who were resettled in the U.S. numbered 155,000 Iraqis and 38,000 Afghans. Every one of us passed through multiple screening processes that included at least two personal interviews, a medical check, and a thorough security background check. The process takes no less than a year and could stretch to several years.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nI applied for resettlement after working as a journalist for The New York Times in Iraq. My focus as a journalist was corruption, and for that, I was sued, threatened and harassed by the Iraqi government and its insurgent affiliates. I also lost my father when he was killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq (now ISIS) in western Baghdad as part of the terror group’s effort to wipe out members of the Shiite majority in Iraq. My family and I were also displaced from our home.\n\nNevertheless, my vetting process took three years, and it only ended after my former colleague, the late journalist Anthony Shadid, who twice won the Pulitzer Prize for covering Iraq, and the late senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, personally intervened on my behalf. Also, several press protection non-profits like the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters without Borders and the International Press Institute vouched for me. My family members had waited another four years before they were admitted in late 2015.\n\nOnce in the U.S., I worked like many other refugees in several subsistence jobs in New York. Once, I worked at Dish Network answering phones as a customer service agent. It was a horrible job where I was constantly yelled at. But I made some friends, and I paid my bills. The friends I made there eased the loneliness that I felt in the America. After more than a year in that job, I quit and started writing again. Then, I eventually found my way to journalism again. I married an American woman, and we had a son. I lived in New York and in Kansas, and I was able to know both the lifestyles of the East coast and of the Midwest and the political preferences associated with each.\n\nThe very liberal environment in New York, where minorities -- including devout Muslims -- are welcomed and encouraged to participate in all forms of social life is in contrast to Kansas where minorities are just a small portion of the white Christian-dominated population. I was shocked to see how popular Halal food is in New York City. I had to explain many times to Americans that Halal food is not a cuisine, but a religious imprimatur like kosher. I was also surprised to see those religious South Asian Muslims who dress like Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban walking freely in New York’s streets after attending services in local mosques.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nLater on, I knew that while most of these Muslims were never harassed by law enforcement authorities or the FBI, the New York police department spied on some of them and the FBI engaged in “sting operations” luring them to join al-Qaeda or ISIS in response to recruitment calls by agents posing as terrorists.\n\nWhat I experienced when I entered the land of the free has changed now with the election of President Donald Trump. Even before the new administration took office, the flood of millions of refugees from the Middle East to Europe, followed by a series of ISIS orchestrated attacks in Paris, and other European cities have somehow branded all refugees as potential terrorists in the eyes of some Americans. Then came the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando, which were inspired by ISIS. The stage was set for a new era of Islamophobia, similar to the one following 9/11. Trump seized the moment.\n\nMany Americans conflated the European migration crisis and the terror attacks which took place afterward in Europe with refugees admitted to the U.S. The refugees who went to Europe were mainly people without papers who illegally landed on Europe’s shores by boats. There was no vetting process in Europe. That is not the case with the refugees admitted to the U.S. who have already passed the most extreme vetting process.\n\nWhat happened in Europe also revealed incompetence within the ranks of the French and Belgium security and intelligence services that allowed ISIS operatives to travel back and forth, conspire and conduct the attacks without detection. This is not the case in the U.S. where the FBI is much more alert to terror plots. Lastly, there is a demographic factor involved. In Europe, Muslims are the second largest religion in several countries. In France for instance, Muslims make up to 10 percent of the population.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq’s Oil\n\nWhile it is the right and indeed the duty of every government to defend its people, the temporary travel ban imposed by Trump on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries will most likely be ineffective and counterproductive. Take Iraq, for example. Few Iraqis who were admitted to the U.S. have been involved in acts of terrorism because all had to go through the same intensive security background check that I went through.\n\nIn fact, all refugees admitted to the U.S. go through these procedures. The other important point is that almost all the Iraqi refugees are actually people who risked their lives while helping the United States in Iraq. Many of them lost relatives in acts of revenge against them by anti-American insurgent groups. Arresting them in the airports after their tragic and lengthy journey to the safety of the U.S. is a blow to American patriotism and will send the wrong message to the world that the U.S. punishes its friends instead of helping them.\n\nPerhaps more important, at least 80 percent of Iraqis are actually natural enemies of ISIS and al-Qaeda because they are either Shiites who are considered heretics by ISIS, Kurds who admire and appreciate the U.S. policy in the Middle East, or minorities like Christians and Yazidis.\n\nAmong those Iraqis who can’t enter the U.S. now are a group of Iraqi Air Force pilots who should be trained on flying the F-16, the U.S. trained chief of the counter-terrorism service in Iraq whose soldiers defeated ISIS in every battle since 2014, and my good friend Lukman Faily, the former Iraqi ambassador to the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. has an obligation to admit the Iraqis and Afghans who helped the country during two conflicts, the Syrian case is different. Nevertheless, the U.S. has a moral responsibility to aid the Syrian refugees because of the horror and suffering they have experienced. America also has a legal responsibility because the U.S. is a signatory of the 1951 convention that states, “A refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.”\n\nThese so-called extreme vetting delays may not last long because of the legal battles they have generated. Nevertheless, they may have damaged America’s national security for years to come. After I received advice from some American friends asking me not to use any airport or airplane until further notice, I suddenly started to identify with what Jews felt in the early days of Nazi Germany.\n\nNote: Riyadh Mohammed is in Wichita, Kansas today for his final American citizenship interview. All of us at The Fiscal Times wish him the best of luck."

    "text": "Libertarians and conservatives who would like to dismantle or further restrain the Internal Revenue Service are not likely to applaud, but Donald Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary has been making the case for beefing up the agency and exempting it from the federal hiring freeze the president just put in place.\n\nRelated: Mnuchin Says He Takes the Debt Ceiling More Seriously Than Trump\n\nAs William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, points out in an op-ed Tuesday, Steve Mnuchin has a sizeable argument for giving the IRS more firepower: Some $510 billion of taxes were not paid in 2016.\n\n“To put that in perspective,” Gale writes, “that’s almost as large as the entire federal budget deficit – $587 billion in 2016.”\n\nAt his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 19, Mnuchin called for modernizing the IRS by upgrading its technology and adding staff. The former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, who turned the failing bank IndyMac into the successful One West, said he would use his “expertise to bring the IRS up to date.”\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, GOP presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz of Texas talked about abolishing the IRS, and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s tax blueprint would “streamline” the tax collector. In Washington parlance, “streamline” often means reducing resources and cutting staff.\n\nRelated: Wall Street's Honeymoon With Trump Is Over\n\nBut as Gale suggests, one of the reasons the IRS is not doing a better job of beating the bushes for tax cheats is that, “Adjusted for inflation, IRS funding in 2016 was the same as in 1998. As a result, IRS employment has fallen about 27 percent – by 30,000 workers – since then.”\n\nBloomberg says that the IRS budget for 2016 was “about $900 million less than its budget for fiscal year 2011, according to a report last year from the Government Accountability Office.”\n\nBy Gale’s calculations, “the IRS audited only 0.8 percent of individual and 1.3 percent of corporate returns” in 2015. That compares “with 1.1 and 1.4 percent, respectively, in 2010 and 1 and 2.1 percent, respectively, in 1998,” he writes. “The audit rate for households with income over $1 million has fallen by 40 percent since 2010.”\n\nAt the same time that its resources and staff have been reduced, Gales says that “the number of individual tax returns has increased by a third — from 123 million in 1998 to 163 million in 2015.”\n\nRelated: U.S. Treasury Nominee Mnuchin Hammered Over Offshore Tax Havens\n\nMnuchin may get a chance to make the IRS a more efficient money machine, but perhaps not right away: Democrats boycotted a Senate Finance Committee vote on his nomination Tuesday as part of a larger protest against Trump on the Hill that also sidelined the nominations of Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General and Representative Tom Prices for Health & Human Services Secretary."

    "text": "Less than two weeks into his administration, President Donald Trump on Tuesday summoned the heads of many top drug manufacturers to the White House in a first step towards making good on his campaign pledge to crack down on soaring drug prices that have dramatically driven up the costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and employee health programs.\n\nHe also pledged to speed up Food and Drug Administration approval of cutting-edge drugs for treating cancer and other life-threatening diseases. “We have to do better at accelerating cures,” he declared.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nTrump complained recently that the major drug companies were “getting away with murder” by gouging consumers and the government. And at the top of his first bargaining session with pharmaceutical industry executives and lobbyists, the president complained about “astronomical” drug price increases.\n\n“We have to get the prices way down,” Trump told the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade organization PhRMA. \"We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid, we have to get prices way down.”\n\nWhile providing few specifics with reporters and cameras in the room, Trump outlined what is likely to be the heart of his strategy for overhauling U.S. prescription drug industry practices: Jawboning companies to moderate future hikes in drug costs under the threat of government sanction; encouraging competition through government deregulation and tax breaks; pressuring multinational drug companies to bring jobs back to the U.S., and cutting the time it takes the FDA to approve new drugs by months or even years.\n\n\"We’re going to be cutting regulation at a level nobody's ever seen before,\" Trump said in the meeting with executives. \"You can’t get approval for the plant and then you can’t get approval to make the drug, other than that you’re doing fantastic,\" he said.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nReforming the FDA “to put greater focus on the need of patients for new and innovative medical products” was a key provision of Trump’s campaign health plan. Trump said today that too often, the FDA has been overly cautious in approving new drugs desperately needed by sick patients – sometimes resulting in unnecessary deaths.\n\nCongress last November approved the so-called 21st Century Cures legislation that earmarks $6.3 billion of biomedical research, opioid abuse prevention and support for the FDA in overseeing the safety of drugs. The new law also contains a handful of provisions to ease the requirements for drug manufacturers seeking government approval to sell their products. Trump says he wants to go much further.\n\n\"You're going to get your prices either approved or not approved,\" Trump told the executives. \"But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years.\" (It's not clear what Trump meant by prices being approved since the government does not negotiate drug prices.)\n\nWhether it all turns out to be political window dressing or a serious reform effort remains to be seen. Much of what Trump said was more rhetorical flourishes than specifics. And little can be done to flesh out his proposals until Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, and a new head of the Food and Drug Administration are in place.\n\nHowever, as Trump demonstrated with his initial flurry of executive orders on Obamacare, immigration and building a wall along the southern border, he is determined to quickly turn campaign promises into concrete policy.\n\nSome of the drug company CEOs expressed interest in working with the new White House on drug pricing issues as the meeting was beginning. And the National Coalition of Health Care, a group of dozens of medical groups, insurers and consumer advocates, hailed the meeting as an important first step in addressing the drug pricing issue.\n\n“We applaud President Trump for making the out-of-control prices of prescription drugs a priority in his Administration,” John Rother, the president and CEO of the coalition, said in a statement.\n\n“Increased competition in the prescription drug market, real transparency into the drivers of drug prices, and ensuring that prices are linked to the value they provide are what will deliver lower prices for hardworking American families,” he added. “We look forward to working with Congress and the Administration to ensure that all patients are able to obtain lifesaving medications at prices they can afford.”\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. Over the past two years, the country has been wracked by outrageous cases of price gouging by pharmaceutical companies by as much as 1,000 percent to 5,000 percent for some life-saving drugs.\n\nSome of the worst offenders include Mylan Pharmaceutical, maker of the EpiPen drug dispenser for allergic children; Gilead Sciences, a manufacturer of two biometric wonder drugs for treating the Hepatitis-C virus, and Turing Pharmaceutical, formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, the notorious hedge fund manager. None of those companies were invited to the White House session.\n\nTrump first highlighted his concerns about skyrocketing drug prices in September 2015 when he lashed out at Shkreli for raising the price of a 62-year old drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill. \"He looks like a spoiled brat to me,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference in South Carolina.\n\nPerhaps as a shrewd bargaining tactic going into his meeting with drug company CEOs today, the former billionaire real estate businessman held back on his toughest ideas that were aired during the campaign. That may have been a bargaining tactic to use as leverage in extracting future concessions.\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nOne idea would be to allow the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada to enhance competition. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both advocated that change, despite strong opposition from the drug industry.\n\nAnother would permit Medicare officials to negotiate down prices with major drug companies by eliminating a non-negotiation ban contained in the 2003 Medicare Part D drug legislation. That prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits.\n\nSome analysts say Medicare, the premier health program for the elderly, could save more than a half trillion dollars over the coming decade by tough negotiations with drug companies.\n\nPhRMA and its long-time GOP allies on Capitol Hill have fought for years to preserve that ban on negotiating drug prices for the national health care program for seniors and are digging in again to block efforts to repeal the restriction.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nHowever, Trump says he is determined to shake up the status quo – even at the expense of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill. And he has begun conferring with a prominent senior House Democrat, Rep. Elijah C. Cummings of Maryland, who along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have waged war with the drug companies for years and co-sponsored one of the toughest price control bills in Congress."

    "text": "Wall Street's post-election honeymoon with President Donald Trump is devolving into typical marital bickering as his controversial immigration ban and plans to clamp down on H-1B skilled worker visas is sending chills up the spines of many in the business world, especially in Silicon Valley.\n\nThis supports my long-term expectation for the Trump White House: The end of a multi-decade neo-con/neo-liberal globalization push that benefited big corporations to the detriment of the middle class and small businesses. The hallmark of this was a reorientation of the distribution of national income: Corporate profits (and thus, stock prices) surged to record highs while wages stagnated and the cost of living rose.\n\nRelated: The Top Threat to the US Economy? A Trump Trade War\n\nIf Trump continues with his unique mix of nationalist populism, this trend should reverse. Stocks could suffer along with profits; but wages, driven by a reduction in labor supply (fewer immigrants, both illegal and visa workers) and an increase in demand for American-made products (driven by trade barriers and \"Twitter shaming\" of CEOs to invest in U.S. factories).\n\nTrump is also using various tools, from executive orders to tweets, to pressure individual companies to lower their prices. He has taken on Lockheed Martin (LMT) and its F-35 program. General Dynamics (GD) has been put on notice that the U.S. Navy needs new submarines at a lower cost. Automakers have been scrambling to tout their plans for investment and hiring in the United States. And drug makers have been warned they are getting away with \"murder\" and that the U.S. government could start bidding on medicine, driving down drug prices.\n\nAdding to the change in investor sentiment are reports that Trump's tax reform plans — Wall Street had focused most on the chances of a corporate tax cut and a possible repatriation holiday — could be delayed until 2018.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nThe sudden realization that Trump may not be as beneficial to the big business establishment and thus Wall Street is coming at a time of unique vulnerability for stocks, which are coming off of one of the quietest four-year runs in market history and the lowest volatility December since 1900.\n\nYears of aggressive monetary policy stimulus have kept stock prices inflated. But now the Federal Reserve is looking to tighten policy by raising rates. Higher labor costs resulting from Trump policies will pinch corporate profitability at a time when revenue growth has stalled (look at the likes of Apple (AAPL) and IBM (IBM)). A combination of higher interest rates and margin pressure will be toxic to stock prices as equity valuations are extremely stretched.\n\nIf investors had priced in a future that suddenly looks less likely, what do we make of last week's breakout to new highs? Conventional wisdom would suggest such a breakout from a multi-month sideways crawl would presage further gains. But according to Jason Goepfert at SentimenTrader, the evidence suggests this was a head fake designed to help the big funds exit positions ahead of a bout of weakness.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Big Threat to Americans That Trump Is Ignoring\n\nGoing back to 1928, when the S&P 500 has fallen one week and jumped 1 percent to a three-year high the following week, the average return in the next two weeks and four weeks was -0.2 percent and -0.4 percent respectively — much worse than the average gain of 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent for any random such periods. Moreover, six of the last seven instances were much worse than these averages, including the start of new bear markets in 1999 and 2007 (featuring one-year losses of 12.6 percent and 32.1 percent respectively).\n\nAnthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters.

    "text": "If there is anything we have learned about Donald Trump since he descended his golden escalator 18 months ago to announce his presidential campaign, it’s that his ego is easily bruised and that he holds a grudge against whoever did the bruising. He gets and remains angry at people who have criticized him, belittled him or stolen his spotlight, and feels compelled to lash out.\n\nFor the brief moment in the campaign when Ben Carson surged ahead of him in the polls, he lashed out at the celebrated brain surgeon, comparing him to a child molester. When members of Congress make headlines criticizing him, he goes after them personally on Twitter. The idea that he didn’t win the popular vote gnaws at him enough to spawn an investigation of massive voter fraud that nobody with real knowledge of the electoral system believes in for a moment.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Immigration and Obamacare Policies Could Trigger a GOP Backlash\n\nGiven Trump’s sensitivity to slights and his anger at the suggestion that he is not as popular or as strong a leader as he believes he is, it seems reasonable to ask: How long is he going to be able to tolerate headlines declaring that it appears to be Steve Bannon, President Trump’s chief White House strategist, that’s running the administration, and not Trump?\n\nBecause there are a lot of them out there right now. The New York Times on Tuesday ran an editorial headlined simply, “President Bannon?” GQ magazine carried an article that states, “In Case It Wasn't Clear Yet, Steve Bannon Is Our President.” Politico ran with “The man behind Trump? Still Steve Bannon.” And Foreign Policy writes about “President Bannon’s Hugely Destructive First Week in Office.”\n\nThe unkindest cut of all, for a president addicted to Twitter, may have been when the hashtag #StopPresidentBannon began trending on the social media platform after the administration’s controversial executive order on refugees was released on Friday.\n\nIn the past, Trump has exploded when actors on Saturday Night Live portrayed him as an egotistical naif whose top advisers (and potential adversaries, like Russian President Vladimir Putin) are leading him around by the nose.\n\nHow much more will it irk Trump to see the question of who is really running the White House being asked openly is the media that he professes to despise, but consumes voraciously? It’s a question that must be consuming a lot of people in the White House right now, not least of them Steve Bannon."

    "text": "Say what you will about former acting Attorney General Sally Yates’ refusal to enforce the Trump administration’s controversial executive order on immigration -- she’s being simultaneously hailed as a heroic defender of the Constitution and a grandstanding hack -- but her decision and subsequent firing late Monday speaks volumes about the bumbling start the Trump administration is off to in its first two weeks.\n\nYates, a career Justice Department employee, was left running the show at the Department of Justice after President Trump was inaugurated and former AG Loretta Lynch stepped down. On Monday, she released a memo to federal prosecutors informing them that in her judgment, the executive order banning refugees from entering the country and restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries was not constitutional. She instructed them not to defend it in court.\n\nRelated: Here’s Who Wins With Trump’s Order to Slash Regulations\n\nThe memo outlined her responsibility to assure that the Department’s actions are legal and “consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.”\n\nShe added, “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.” As long as she remained acting AG, she said, DOJ “will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, she did not remain acting AG for very long. Yates was relieved of her job shortly afterward in a move the White House announced in a vituperative memo declaring that she had “betrayed” the Department of Justice and declared her “weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.”\n\nYates was promptly replaced with Dana Boente, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who said that he would instruct Justice Department attorneys to defend the executive order in court.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Big Threat to Americans That Trump Is Ignoring\n\nWhite House officials were plainly furious with Yates. Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller appeared on Fox News and declared, “It can’t be stated strongly enough how reckless, irresponsible and improper the behavior was of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, in refusing to defend the president’s order.” He insisted that the president’s action was legal and said that it had been cleared by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nThe incident quickly drew somewhat overblown comparisons to former president Richard Nixon’s infamous Saturday Night Massacre, in which he worked his way through the resignations of top DOJ officials until he found one willing to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the Watergate scandal.\n\nBut where Nixon’s actions were sordid examples of an unscrupulous man willing to push the boundaries of legality to preserve his own power, the Yates firing was more a case of borderline incompetence creating unnecessary and embarrassing chaos.\n\nThe Trump administration is staffed with people who worked on the Trump presidential campaign, an undisciplined and chaotic affair that, though ultimately successful, triumphed in spite of its own missteps. They are now learning that the process of governing isn’t nearly as forgiving as the process of campaigning.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nThe immigration order was written with little or no input from the agencies that would be required to enforce it, and it was signed with no advance warning. Even a cursory attempt to take the temperature of the agencies on the front lines of immigration enforcement might have enabled the Trump administration to avoid significant embarrassment, but even that most basic step wasn’t taken.\n\nThat’s why, instead of quietly replacing Yates with Boente on, say, Friday -- something that administration had every ability to do -- they were forced to take emergency action on Monday.\n\nThe same lack of preparation is reflected in a stinging draft of a memo dissenting to the executive order that was signed by more than 100 career foreign service officers and made public on Monday morning. Again, early steps that might have tempered that reaction were not taken, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was reduced to demanding that they “either get with the program or they can go.”\n\nSetting aside the merits of the executive order as a legal or even moral matter, what we’re seeing here with regard to its rollout and implementation looks less like Nixonian malevolence and more like the basic incompetence of a new administration learning the hard way that it cannot govern the way it campaigned."

    "text": "The “Never Trump” movement began to fade after Donald Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, and it shriveled up when Donald Trump claimed victory over Democratic Hillary Clinton and ‘establishment’ Republican naysayers climbed aboard the Trump train.\n\nWith the Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Commerce for the first time in a decade, the GOP’s agenda of repealing and replacing Obamacare, ramming through major tax relief, curtailing regulations and construction of a security wall along the 2,000-mile southern border all seemed like a slam dunk.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nLittle more than ten days into the new tumultuous Trump administration, small fissures are beginning to develop within the party that could threaten important parts of the GOP agenda in the coming months. While experts say it’s far too soon to gauge the extent of party unity heading into some of the Republicans’ biggest challenges this year – including confirming Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court – there already have been some warning signs of a possible backlash.\n\nThe first sign surfaced late last week in Philadelphia, where House and Senate Republicans staged a three-day policy retreat. During protracted closed-door meeting, both rank and file members and more senior Republicans voiced concern that Trump and congressional leaders might be inadvertently leading them into political quicksand by pressing for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act before the party has designed a practical replacement that would prevent tens of millions of Americans from losing their health insurance.\n\nWhile House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) were boasting to reporters that Republicans were moving swiftly to “rescue” Americans from a crumbling and costly Obamacare system, other members were caught on tape fretting that GOP ideas for improving the system don’t add up to a coherent plan.\n\n“We’d better be sure that we’re prepared to live with the market we’ve created” with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), according to a recording leaked by someone in the room. “That’s going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we’ll be judged in the election less than two years away.”\n\nRelated: As Trump Mulls SCOTUS Pick, Here Are The Three Top Contenders\n\n\n\nDuring that same conference, some Republicans raised concerns about Trump’s call for an historic buildup in the U.S. military and nuclear arsenal in the coming decade, asking how Congressional leaders intended to pay for that and other initiatives without sharply cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid or by simply adding to the national debt.\n\n“From what I’ve seen, there’s a lot of inner turmoil in a lot of these members that they’re getting into something – at a much earlier stage – that they didn’t think they’d have to deal with,” Norman Ornstein, a congressional political expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview. “Barely more than a week into this new world, plenty are trying to figure out how to get out of it.”\n\nSome Republicans reportedly were taken aback by Trump’s feud with the media last week over the size of his inauguration crowd, and his insistence on pursuing a wide-ranging probe into his unfounded claims that three million to five million people voted illegally for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November election.\n\nThen, amidst a global uproar and chaos over Trump’s executive order abruptly blocking all refugees from entering the country for the next 120 days and barring all visitors from seven majority Muslim countries for the next 90 days, a steadily growing group of Republican lawmakers either denounced the action or voiced strong reservations.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nRepublican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both leading voices on national defense and foreign policy, quickly complained that Trump’s executive order had not been properly vetted and could be seen as the U.S. turning its back on Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere who had risked their lives to serve as interpreters and guides to the military.\n\n“Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,” they wrote. Trump later dismissed the statement by McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a decorated Vietnam War pilot, and Graham as “weak” on national security.\n\nYet four other Senate Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Jerry Moran of Kansas, came out strongly against the executive order, according to a tally by The Hill. Collins, for example, said that \"religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our American values.\"\n\nFifteen other Republican senators, including McConnell, the majority leader, and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker of Tennessee, expressed concern or reservations about the way it was handled, according to The Hill. McConnell said that \"it's a good idea to tighten the vetting process, but I also think it's important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism are Muslims.\" Ryan has largely defended Trump’s actions.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\nCorker, Alexander and Collins have also raised concerns about their party’s health care strategy, favoring instead a more measured pace in developing a replacement for Obamacare – one that might take years rather than months to fully implement.\n\nCollins and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) have co-sponsored a bill that would essentially leave it to the states to decide whether to continue operating under the Affordable Care Act or adopt a replacement plan largely funded by the federal government. Graham recently signed onto the bill.\n\nNine or 10 House Republicans came out against the executive order as well, including conservative Justin Amash of Michigan and moderate Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. However, the Republicans hold an overwhelming 247 to 188 vote majority in the House, and Ryan should have relatively little trouble holding his conservative caucus together to advance the Trump agenda and fend off Democratic assaults.\n\nBut it is a far different picture in the Senate, where McConnell and the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 majority over the Democrats and can ill afford to suffer any defections. Much has been made about the GOP’s plan to utilize special budget reconciliation rules to push through a repeal of major provisions of Obamacare with a simple majority.\n\nRelated: Did Trump Really Just Slash the Cost of the F-35?\n\nUsually, it takes a 60-vote supermajority to cut off a filibuster and pass a major bill. Under reconciliation, however, the party in power needs just 51 votes to pass a budgets measure that eviscerates key subsidies, tax provisions and mandates on individuals and businesses. However, if just three Republicans voted against the budget, that would stop the Obamacare repeal effort in its tracks.\n\nGOP party unity will also be critical in adopting Obamacare replacement legislation. That’s because any plan advanced by the GOP would not be afforded special treatment under reconciliation rules and would need a super-majority of 60 votes to get anything done. That means McConnell and his lieutenants will somehow have to keep their party members n line while rounding up at least eight Democratic votes.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said Democrats will not help the Republicans pass a replacement plan if they forge ahead and repeal Obamacare without an acceptable replacement in hand. What’s more, Republicans will need Democratic help down the road on a broad array of spending measures -– including Trump’s proposed defense buildup –- and meeting an April 28 deadline for averting another government shutdown.\n\nThe Democrats’ most immediate concern is fighting Trump’s immigration executive order and they spent the weekend rallying opposition and resources to help refugees and migrants caught up in the crisis. Schumer fought back tears in announcing plans to introduce a bill Monday evening to stop the order.\n\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon’s Arsenal\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans blocked the Democrats effort to bring the bill to the floor, but Democrats say the fight over it served to put Republicans on the spot. Last night, a large crowd of Democrats turned out for a protest in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nWhit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster and political adviser, said that while Trump and the Republicans may have gotten off to a rocky start, the looming battle between the Republicans and Democrats over Trump’s Supreme Court nominee will soon dominate the news. Trump is scheduled to announce his choice to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia on Tuesday evening.\n\n“There will always be things that a President will do that will cause some disagreement [within the party], but it’s much too early to be talking about any split. The real question is whether the Democrats will split over a Supreme Court nominee. There clearly are as many divisions in the Democratic party as the Republican party right now.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/31/Trump-Administration-Credibility-May-be-Problem",
    "text": "As a department chair at a university, you learn that a promise from the Dean or anyone else in the administration is good for about five years. That’s approximately how long Deans last, on average, and when a new Dean arrives past commitments are not necessarily honored. Promises from administrators are not credible no matter how much assurance is given that a commitment is permanent.\n\nPoliticians are subject to the same type of credibility problem that plagues academic administrators. To what extent can Obamacare, or anything else, be regarded as a permanent change in government policy? A new president or a new Congress can potentially undo any legislation, administrative rule, or anything else enacted in the past.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq’s Oil\n\nBut politicians have an additional credibility problem over and above their inability to make long-run commitments. Little of what politicians say can be trusted even during the years they are in office. And with Trump saying whatever comes to his mind, or whatever a particular audience wants to hear, his erratic behavior, and his tendency to contradict himself, who knows what to believe? Nothing is credible until it happens, and even then it might be reversed.\n\nCredibility is essential in both monetary and fiscal policy. It is easily lost, and once it is gone it takes a long time to rebuild. Monetary policy provides a good example. During the inflation problems that plagued the 1970s, the Fed promised again and again that it would get the situation under control. Then the next year inflation would be even higher than it was before.\n\nPeople quickly learned that the Fed’s promises about inflation, and by association anything else, were meaningless. It’s like a spouse who promises to be home at a particularly time, and then consistently shows up hours late. After awhile, those promises mean nothing. Even if the behavior does change it will take a long time for trust – credibility – to be restored and a lingering doubt may always be there.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nThe Fed finally began rebuilding its credibility when Volcker took control in 1979. The Fed tightened monetary policy under Volcker and that led to the 1982 recession. The Fed was heavily criticized, but its political independence allowed it to endure and the policy turned out to be a success. After that, during what is known as the Great Moderation from the early 1980s through 2007, inflation continued to fall and it eventually leveled off around the Fed’s inflation target.\n\nThe Fed had finally gained credibility about its inflation promises, but it took decades. Even now many people –- especially those who remember the 1970s – do not fully trust the Fed to keep inflation under wraps. All of the fears about out of control inflation hyped during the Great Recession testify to that (though in many cases the criticism leveled at the Fed was politically motivated).\n\nWhy should we care about the credibility of monetary and fiscal policymakers? For fiscal policy, economic theory tells us that temporary changes in government spending will have a larger impact on the economy than permanent changes. But if Congress announces that an increase in spending is a temporary measure that will be reversed when the recession ends (we promise!), will people believe it?\n\nIf not, if most people believe that once government spending is put into place it never goes away (which is a myth), then fiscal stimulus will not be as effective as it could be. Conversely, if the government announces a permanent reduction in the size of government, will anyone believe that whatever cuts are made are truly permanent? If not, if people believe that cuts to spending will likely be restored at some point, perhaps when the other party takes back control of government then the cuts will have a more severe impact on the economy than they would otherwise.\n\nRelated: How the GOP Could Wipe Out Federal Regulations in One Easy Step\n\nCredibility is just as important, if not more so, for the Fed. When the Fed has credibility, its ability to keep inflation on target is enhanced. And if inflation does go up, credibility allows the Fed to bring it back down without creating a deep recession. I expect, but can’t be sure, that when the time comes Trump will replace Janet Yellen with someone who is at least competent, though I will likely disagree strongly with his or her views on policy. But what will happen with the other six members of the Board of Governors?\n\nThere are currently two openings (Republicans refused to confirm Obama’s nominees for these positions), and if recent history is any guide Trump, like Obama and Bush, will appoint most if not all of the Board by the time his term ends. Will he appoint people who are at least competent, or, like so many of Trump’s other appointments to important government positions, will they be cronies with little or no experience who are being rewarded for their loyalty?\n\nWill they be politically independent or beholden to whatever monetary policy changes Trump wants? If they are both lacking in experience and unwilling to go against Trump’s wishes, which seems to me a very real possibility, will anyone have confidence in the Fed? Will it be able to keep the credibility it worked so hard to establish and protect?\n\nRelated: Trump Just Blew His Chance to Renegotiate NAFTA\n\nI don’t have much faith in Congress when it comes to fiscal policy (or anything else). The little faith I once had that Congress would at least set aside politics and do what’s best for the economy during a severe economic crisis was shattered by Republican obstructionism during the Great Recession. But at least we’ve always had a relatively politically independent Fed that kept its eye on what’s best for the country rather than on winning the next election.\n\nThe Fed has made mistakes -- nobody and no institution is perfect -- but for the most part it’s done an admirable job over the last few decades of managing monetary policy (its handling of regulatory policy is another matter). If Trump compromises the independence and competency of the Fed, we will lose the only effective policymaking body we have left, and the next recession will be more severe than it needs to be. We know who will be hurt the most if that happens, and it won’t be the people still smiling about the huuuge tax cuts they got from Trump."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/30/Here-s-Who-Wins-Trump-s-Order-Slash-Regulations",
    "text": "President Trump on Monday morning signed an executive order, “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs.” The order appears to be a gift to the business community, which constantly complains of the burden of compliance with federal requirements. It also appears to vest considerable power in the director of the Office of Management and Budget to throttle federal rulemaking if that’s what the administration wants to do. But it promises no immediate disruption.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nThe headline elements of the new order are that federal agencies need to target two rules for elimination for every new rule they issue, and that the executive branch will move toward establishing a “regulatory budget” for federal agencies.\n\nWhile both of those steps might feel foreign to Washington, they’d be pretty familiar in a number of other advanced Western democracies.\n\nThe executive order stipulates that, “Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.”\n\nThe idea of a one-in, two-out rule for regulations is not a creation of the Trump administration, but is borrowed from other countries that use a similar method to assure that outdated or redundant requirements that impose a burden on people or businesses are actively sought out and eliminated. The United Kingdom, for example, instituted a similar requirement in 2013.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nThe executive order also contains the building blocks of a regulatory budget. It requires that for the remainder of 2017, the net incremental cost of the regulations federal agencies issue “shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.” In other words, the cost of the new regulations must be less than the costs of those being eliminated.\n\nIn the following years, the OMB director will, on an annual basis “identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for the next fiscal year. No regulations exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.” The order adds the warning that the annual budget could effectively be negative, requiring a net reduction in regulatory costs.\n\nAgain, this is not uncommon elsewhere. Canada, for example, has had regulatory budgeting in some provincial governments since 2001, and began moving toward it on the federal level with the election of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2006.\n\nThe big question now is how the executive order will be implemented, say experts.\n\nRelated: Trump Targets Muslims, Mexico and Iraq’s Oil\n\n“I really think that the devil is in the details on this kind of scheme,” said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe bigger challenge of the two main elements of the order will be the regulatory budget, he said. And that will be up to Trump’s OMB director, who is expected to be Rep. Mick Mulvaney.\n\n“How is cost assessed? What, exactly, counts as a regulation for these purposes? This order doesn’t define any of that stuff. It leaves it all for the director of the Office of Management and Budget to figure out.”\n\nTo know what the real effect of the order will be, Wallach said, it will be necessary to see how OMB defines many of the key terms in it and how the White House decides to handle exceptions.\n\nRelated: Why ‘Repeal and Delay’ of Obamacare Could Send Premiums Soaring Next Year\n\n“There could be a whole lot of gaping exceptions that make it so this really doesn’t do a whole lot … but that’s just one possibility,” he said.\n\nWhat the order does do, though, is at least open the door to greater White House control of the regulatory process.\n\n“I think it’s possible that the OMB could use it as a way of trying to exert a lot of control over the various regulatory agencies. We’ll just have to wait and see."

    "text": "While tens of thousands of people protested Donald Trump’s travel ban at airports nationwide, Delta Airlines announced a travel ban of its own. The company’s second major computer outage in six months froze domestic departures for hours on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of about 170 flights overnight and another 110 on Monday. It was the second major airline power outage in a week, following a United failure. Donald Trump even blamed the Delta disaster for problems at the airports, to deflect from the chaos of his immigration ban.\n\nDelta and its fellow airline giants aren’t Trump’s excuse to employ but his problem to solve. As I wrote back in August, these IT breakdowns have become more frequent as the industry has concentrated. Ancient legacy systems get grafted together with Scotch tape, without the investments necessary to keep them from imploding.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nRecent airline mergers were all sold on the basis of creating efficiencies for passengers; instead they just magnify disruptions by making supply chains more fragile. Outages among the four airlines that manage 85 percent of all domestic routes cause outsized delays, cancellations and missed connections. Judging by their actions, the airlines clearly don’t care. Delta may have lost $100 million in sales after the August crash, but with a record-breaking $6.6 billion in profits last year, it had little incentive to invest in improvements. After all, consumers have nowhere else to go.\n\nThis concept of judging corporations by actions carries over to the other major transportation snafu of the weekend. When New York City taxi drivers called for a one-hour wildcat strike, refusing pickups at JFK airport to protest the immigration ban, Uber used the opportunity to suspend surge pricing, making its service more attractive and available.\n\nUber’s knee-jerk reaction to undermine the strike overshadowed its vows of sympathy with those suffering. CEO Travis Kalanick promised to support the “dozen or so” drivers affected with pro bono compensation while they await return to the U.S., although the other vague gestures in the statement (“takes virtually no position aside from that America is great”) underwhelmed. But in a moment of decision, Uber saw an expression of solidarity with refugee families and thought immediately about how to make money off it. And people recognized this, as the hashtag “#deleteUber” went viral on social media.\n\nRelated: Silicon Valley Puts Money and Muscle into Fighting Trump Immigrant Curbs\n\nThe calculating responses by other tech companies in an attempt to avoid Uber’s pitfall didn’t end up looking much better. Lyft, Uber’s main nationwide competitor, announced it would give $1 million to the ACLU — only the fine print said that the donation would stretch over four years. Lyft’s investors include Trump advisor Peter Thiel. The same is true of Facebook and startup incubator Y Combinator, whose milquetoast statements of opposition to the ban also did not address this fact.\n\nAirbnb pledged free housing to those stranded in a country other than their own because of the immigration ban. But because the company doesn’t own any physical properties, it’s really only begging its members to volunteer their own properties for free. This costs Airbnb nothing, and relies on the generosity of their members for a PR bonanza.\n\nThis tendency to exploit public anger with a less-meaningful-than-advertised show of solidarity — call it the anti-Trump version of oil companies’ pro-environment “greenwashing,” so maybe Trump-washing — has become ubiquitous among Silicon Valley, which you can’t spell without the word “con.” The history of foreign-born entrepreneurs and employees in the tech world may make Trump’s executive order hit home, but ultimately the gestures have been toothless — and sometimes, like in the case of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, so have the words. Like Kalanick, Musk sits on a Trump administration advisory panel.\n\nRelated: Here’s How Trump Could Drive the Economy Into a Ditch\n\nThe real danger to tech giants is the threat to their desire to dominate the globe, and how Trump’s ham-fisted aggression might rub off on them. The White House’s imminent executive order limiting work-visa programs that Silicon Valley relies on for its employee base will cause far greater concern, because of the threat to the bottom line. While these programs have their place, they have also been employed to drive down worker wages.\n\nThis is why enabling massive corporate concentration that reduces the power of workers and innovators means so much more than what can be seen on the balance sheet. Multinationals seeking a foothold in every market will inevitably take no stand that might disrupt their ability to make a buck, and work with anyone, no matter how odious. Non-union behemoths with no history or understanding of solidarity will put their profits ahead of any other value. A sense of social responsibility is important, though it never appears in an economic analysis of a merger or statistic about union density. Your local monopolist is not interested in how you feel or who you support, only that you have no other choice but to purchase their wares.\n\nUnfortunately for Uber, they let the mask slip before cornering the market in ride-hailing. Anyone can build an app, even the taxi companies, without impoverishing their employees so much they have to sleep in their cars. Uber’s strategy of burning through venture capital money to attract market share, only to turn the tables and jack up prices amid no competition, ran up against a fundamental issue – losing the trust of the customer base, which finally realized that what they buy is a political act.\n\nRelated: US No Longer a ‘Full Democracy,’ but It’s Not Trump’s Fault: Report\n\nDelta is where Uber wants to be: comfortably ensconced as the nation’s second-largest airline, insulated from public opinion, regardless of quality control or greed. Delta, American and United have responded to regions that can’t support their business by simply abandoning them, something Uber would gladly emulate. Forty years of deregulation brought us to that point of ripping away airline passenger control. In other words, Uber’s biggest error lay in not securing their monopoly yet.\n\nIf Trump wants to truly make America safe, he could use the century-old laws on the books to break up monopolies that prey upon all citizens. But he’s apparently more concerned with theater that gives the impression of freedom and security, rather than making people truly secure and free."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/30/Can-We-Afford-Trump-s-Border-Wall-Mexico",
    "text": "Before President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration unleashed a firestorm of debate and waves of protests, it was his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border that was grabbing attention and stirring dispute.\n\nTrump's plans to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto broke down in acrimony over who will pay for the border wall — eventually being resolved via a phone call on Friday where both pledged to keep their discussions out of the press. But disagreements over who will pay for the wall lingered.\n\nRelated: Here’s What the US Imports From Mexico – and Who Would Pay Trump’s 20% Tax\n\nGiven an executive action signed by Trump has already authorized construction of the border wall, and given that Trump has support from Congressional Republicans, the obvious question is: If Mexico doesn't pay, what could the wall cost the average American?\n\nAccording to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the cost of construction would be somewhere between $12 billion and $15 billion. That comes out to around $100 per U.S. household.\n\nThat’s pocket change in the grand scheme of things, but it comes in the context of a serious and worsening fiscal outlook for the U.S. Treasury. Let's hope Mexico pays for the wall, because American taxpayers already have a huge bill coming due very soon: The national debt is quickly closing in on the $20 trillion mark, which is worth nearly $62,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Blew His Chance to Renegotiate NAFTA\n\nWatch for deficits and the national debt to return to the headlines soon as the U.S. Treasury once again approaches its statutory debt ceiling — the subject of repeated standoffs between President Obama and Congressional Republicans between 2011 and 2013.\n\nA fresh update on the fiscal outlook from the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget paints a bleak picture. Under their current baseline forecast, which assumes modest average GDP growth of 1.9 percent over the next 10 years, trillion-dollar deficits will return by the 2023 fiscal year, expanding from $587 billion last year (3.2 percent of GDP) to $1.4 trillion (5.0 percent of GDP) by 2027.\n\nRelated: Here’s How Trump Could Drive the Economy Into a Ditch\n\nAs a result, the national debt will grow by more than $11 trillion. Much of this, to be fair, isn't Trump's fault, as spending on \"entitlement\" programs such as Medicare and Social Security will drive the lion's share of the deficit increase. But possible policy chances, such as repealing certain cost offsets in Obamacare, cutting taxes and eliminating caps on defense spending, would worsen the outlook.\n\nIf Trump is going to balance the budget, or even just stabilize the debt by shrinking the federal deficit, we're going to need more than a big check from Mexico City. We're going to need sizable budget cuts (we’d have to slash 40 percent of non-entitlement, non-defense spending) and a big acceleration in GDP growth to boost tax receipts (especially if tax rates are cut). CRFB estimates the economy would need to grow, on average, 3.5 percent per year for the next 10 years to make this possible.\n\nIt's improbable — although that’s exactly what could've been said about Trump's candidacy at every single stage."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/30/Did-Trump-Really-Just-Cut-Cost-F-35",
    "text": "President Donald Trump boasted on Monday that he was instrumental in knocking roughly $600 million off the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program as part of his effort to bring down defense costs.\n\nDuring a White House conference on small businesses Monday morning, Trump highlighted the savings he said he squeezed out of defense giant Lockheed Martin.\n\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon’s Arsenal\n\n“We cut approximately $600 million off the F-35 fighter,” Trump said during the meeting in the Oval Office. “I appreciate Lockheed Martin for being so responsive, and that will be appreciated very much.”\n\nTrump also claimed to have fixed the F-35 program more generally: “There were great delays, about seven years of delays, tremendous cost overruns. We’ve ended all that, and we’ve got that program really, really now in good shape.”\n\nThe president acknowledged that the savings applies only to the latest batch of 90 of the stealth jet fighters, out of close to 3,000 planes called for in the overall program. He said that the savings stemmed from high-level talks that Trump instigated with Lockheed Martin beginning in early January, after he complained that spending for the aircraft was “out of control.”\n\nTrump summoned Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed’s CEO, to his Florida estate on Dec. 21 for a meeting that included the military head of the F-35 program. Trump and Hewson met again in January, this time at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Is Planning a New Super Rival to the Troubled F-35\n\nAt that second session, Hewson signaled to the president-elect that Lockheed intended to trim the price of the next batch of 90 F-35 jets. Lockheed expected the cost of the latest batch of planes to fall by 6 percent to 7 percent, compared to the previous batch.\n\nValerie Insinna, the air warfare reporter at Defense News, calculated that the $600 million reduction in costs claimed by Trump for the next batch of F-35s is roughly in line with expected drop in price.\n\nLast week, Hewson said that the cost reductions she negotiated with Trump were not tantamount to “slashing our profit” or hurting the company’s profit margins. Instead, she said, the cuts were part of the company’s long-term effort to bring down the cost of the F-35 by lowering costs in the supply chain and manufacturing.\n\nTrump targeted Lockheed Martin as part of a broader attack on costly defense contracts, including Boeing’s proposed next-generation Air Force One. Even before he was sworn in as president Jan. 20, Trump sought to burnish his reputation as negotiator-in-chief by attacking government waste and browbeating the auto industry and other manufacturers to abandon plans for moving jobs overseas.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nIn the case of the F-35, which is worth upwards of $450 billion to Lockheed Martin, Trump threatened to end the contract and replace the fifth-generation fighter plane with an enhanced version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet. He also rattled Air Force brass who felt compelled to challenge the president-elect’s dismissive characterization of the program as a financial disaster.\n\nHowever, as the military subsequently explained to Trump and his aides, the F/A-18 Super Hornet has a much different design and purpose and lacks the stealthy, radar-evading features of the F-35."

    "text": "The Trump administration is poised to pay back many of its general election supporters with a Supreme Court pick in the mold of, as the new vice president recently described him, “the late, great Antonin Scalia.”\n\nPresident Trump on Monday morning announced via Twitter that he has made his choice of a nominee for the empty seat on the Supreme Court and that he will announce his decision Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. The move represents an acceleration of the original timetable, presumably in part to deflect attention from the growing controversy that has swirled around Trump’s executive order banning refugees and residents of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US.\n\nThe addition of a Republican appointee to the court will roughly restore the balance of conservative and liberal justices that had prevailed prior to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. But the selection is heavily freighted with significance for both Trump’s supporters and his political opponents for at least two more reasons.\n\nRelated: Extreme Muslim Immigration Ban Suggests Bannon Is Running the White House\n\nMany conservatives had reservations about supporting Trump during the election because of concerns about his character, conflicts of interest, and policies. But they came around when he promised to select a justice from a list of candidates assembled by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, reasoning that their highest duty was to prevent Hillary Clinton from creating a liberal majority on the court.\n\nAfter a chaotic first week of his presidency, they will be looking to Trump’s pick as justification of their support for a candidate whose actions in office have so far confirmed many of those initial fears.\n\nLiberals will likely greet this appointee with unconcealed anger. Scalia’s vacant seat was held open by the Republican-controlled Senate that, in defiance of all precedent, refused to allow a vote on President Obama’s nominee last year. There have been suggestions of an almost unprecedented filibuster of the nominee unless Trump surprises with a moderate selection.\n\nSo far, that looks very unlikely. The smart money has the short list down to three:\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nMany believe the frontrunner to be Judge Neil Gorsuch who sits on the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver. A 49-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, Gorsuch clerked for sitting Justice Anthony Kennedy before spending time in private practice and serving in the George W. Bush Justice Department.\n\nAnother is Judge Thomas Hardiman, of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Pittsburgh. Hardiman is considered a tough law-and-order judge; he wrote an opinion (later affirmed by the Supreme Court) that held mandatory strip searches of all arrestees is not a violation of the “unreasonable search” clause in the Fourth Amendment. A Georgetown University Law School graduate, he is 51 years old.\n\nA third is Judge William Pryor, of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Birmingham. The oldest of the candidates at 54, Pryor was a popular Alabama attorney general before becoming a judge. In one of the notable episodes of his prosecutorial career, in 2003 he called for the removal of Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore over his refusal to obey a federal court order to remove a sculpture featuring the 10 Commandments from his courthouse. At the time, Pryor said that while he disagreed with the ruling, it was not acceptable for Moore to violate it.\n\nAll three of the nominees appear to be strong opponents of abortion rights, something that many of Trump’s supporters view as a “litmus test” for the nomination, even though the administration itself insists that there is no such test."

    "text": "The two biggest stories of the past few days, President Trump’s immigration ban and his restructuring of the National Security Council to elevate his chief political strategist above top military and intelligence leaders are largely being treated as separate events. But there is a case to be made that they should, even that they must be viewed as two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe ban, announced Friday night, bars all refugees from entering the country for 120 days, and singles out refugees from Syria, the victims of a horrific humanitarian disaster, for an indefinite ban. It also bars people from seven majority Muslim countries, including Syria, and those holding valid visas, from coming to the United States for at least 90 days. The ban was initially applied to legal permanent residents, but after multiple federal judges issued stays against enforcement, the Trump administration seems to be backtracking slightly.\n\nRelated: Trump Says Costs Be Damned as He Moves on Major Defense Buildup\n\nAs many warned, the decision to implement what amounts to a ban on millions of Muslims coming to the United States, combined with Trump’s spoken assurance that he will give preferential treatment to Christians, was greeted with glee by supporters of terrorist organizations. They predicted that it would reinforce the idea that the United States is at war not with terrorism but with Islam as a whole.\n\nAnd that’s where Steve Bannon comes in. Trump’s senior counselor and chief strategist does not want to prevent a war between the US-led West and Islam. He believes an apocalyptic “war of immense proportions” has already started and that the real problem is that the West isn’t taking it seriously enough.\n\nThat view is largely shared by Michael Flynn, the retired Army General who serves as Trump’s National Security Advisor and chairs meetings of the NSC.\n\nThat’s why Friday’s other executive order needs to be seen as a companion piece to the travel ban. The second EO demoted the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- key leaders of the Intelligence and Defense communities, respectively -- from the Principals Committee of the National Security Council. Both will be limited to attending meetings that address issues specifically in their areas of expertise, though many struggled, particularly with regard to the DNI, to think of a national security related subject that would not be in their portfolios.\n\nRelated: Team Trump on Immigration Disruption: ‘It’s a Small Price to Pay’\n\nIn their places, it put Bannon, the former publisher of the alt-right Breitbart News, an individual with no relevant national security experience.\n\nThe reason the refugee ban and Bannon’s elevation to the NSC need to be viewed as connected is that it is Bannon’s worldview that plainly informs Trump’s decision-making on issues like terrorism and relations with the Muslim world.\n\nIn 2014, in a lengthy video-conference presentation to the Human Dignity Institute at the Vatican, Bannon laid out his vision on the need for a “Church Militant” to fight an ongoing war between the Judeo-Christian west and Islam. It is not a struggle for land or influence, in Bannon’s view, but a truly existential fight between Islam and the West.\n\n“We’re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict,” he said. “If the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the Church Militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that’s starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.”\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq’s Oil\n\nBannon continued, in increasingly apocalyptic terms, to describe “a major war brewing, a war that’s already global. It’s going global in scale, and today’s technology, today’s media, today’s access to weapons of mass destruction, it’s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act.”\n\nGiven Bannon’s perspective, the travel ban is not a massive and counterproductive overreaction to a real but limited threat. It’s an early step in the belated prosecution of a war that -- it can’t be stated clearly enough -- he believes has already begun.\n\n“Ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they going to say about me?” he urged the Vatican audience. What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning stages of this crisis?”\n\nHe closed with this: “See what’s happening, and you will see we’re in a war of immense proportions. It’s very easy to play to our baser instincts, and we can’t do that. But our forefathers didn’t do it either. And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think it’s incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role is in this battle that’s before us.”\n\nWith that view in mind, it feels safe to say that if Trump’s immigration ban exacerbates existing divisions between Islam and the West, Bannon will view that as a feature of the new program, not a bug."

    "text": "President Trump declared last week that in seeking an historic buildup in the U.S. military and missile defense, money is no object to him. “I want a balanced budget eventually,” he told Sean Hannity of Fox News. “But I want to have a strong military. To me, that’s much more important than anything.”\n\nTrump took a first major step towards making good on his campaign pledge to boost defense spending with the issuance last Friday of an executive order. In it, the Republican commander-in-chief instructed newly installed Defense Secretary James Mattis to conduct a 30-day “readiness review” to examine needs in the ongoing war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq as well as training, equipment maintenance, modernization, and infrastructure, as The Washington Post reported.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuclear Defense Plan: Another ‘Star Wars’ Budget Buster?\n\nMore broadly, Trump has asked Mattis for a comprehensive plan within two months to improve overall readiness in the armed services by fiscal 2019, including updating the nuclear arsenal and strengthening defenses against the possibility of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea, Iran or some other adversaries.\n\nTrump complained during the 2016 presidential campaign that former President Barack Obama had dangerously depleted the armed services – especially the Navy – as he gradually disengaged the U.S. from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week Trump promised a “great rebuilding” of the armed forces – in some cases returning to levels not seen since the Reagan administration of the 1980s -- to ensure that the sacrifices of the military “are supported by the actions of our government.”\n\nLast September, Trump’s campaign outlined a highly ambitious military buildup plan that he is now attempting to push through Congress. It includes raising the number of active Army troops from 475,000 to 540,000, boosting the number of Marine battalions from 24 to 36, expanding the naval fleet from a planned 280 to 350 and increasing the number of Air Force fighter aircraft by 100 to at least 1,200.\n\nThe president also called for modernizing the nation’s missile defense system and cybersecurity, in the wake of North Korea’s aggressive efforts to develop a long-range nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States and beyond.\n\nTrump at the time promised to find some savings in other parts of the budget to help pay for his proposed military buildup, but it is far more likely that much of the new spending will simply be added to the debt. In order to do that, however, Congress will have to lift the discretionary spending caps on defense that was imposed under the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nThe BCA caps on defense and non-defense spending will last until 2021 unless Congress and the new president decide to change them. Currently, they call for a $609.9 billion limit on defense spending and a $533.4 billion limit on non-defense programs in fiscal 2017. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has cautioned that lifting the defense spending caps alone would add $450 billion to the federal debt over the coming decade.\n\nThe issue will come to a head in late April, when stop-gap spending authority to keep the government running expires and Congress must approve a final spending bill for defense and domestic programs through the remainder of fiscal 2017, which runs through September 30.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), a strong supporter of Trump’s military buildup, said last week that lifting the spending caps on defense will be a top priority of Congress this spring. And Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) declared over the weekend that Trump’s drive for a military buildup is an important step in reasserting U.S. military dominance and discouraging further military aggression and meddling in U.S. political affairs by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\n“I believe that peace through strength is an answer, and I’m glad President Trump has committed to rebuilding our military,” McCain said during an appearance Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program. “That’s one of our first priorities if we’re going to deal on an equal basis with Vladimir Putin.”\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump’s choice to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), testified last week before the Senate Budget Committee that he supports Trump's call for increased defense spending, even if it adds to the deficit.\n\nMulvaney, a Tea Party Republican who has long fought to reduce defense spending, at one time was thought to be a fly in the ointment in Trump’s call for lifting the caps. But he said during his confirmation hearing that he would focus instead on reforming Pentagon personnel policies to try to hold down costs."

    "text": "As the shock of November’s defeat and the reality of being in opposition finally sink in, Democrats are moving beyond denial and starting to think about how to win in 2018 and 2020. This month’s DNC Chair election is providing an opportunity to discuss what went wrong and how to do better. Although I am not a Democrat, I thought my friends on the left could benefit from an outsider’s viewpoint. And, please don’t worry, I won’t tell you to start acting like Republicans.\n\nClinton received 2.9 million more popular votes than Trump but lost the electoral college because her voters were concentrated in a few coastal states. Further, she would have won an electoral college majority had she been able to overcome an aggregate Trump margin of just 78,000 popular votes in three states. Trump’s razor thin victories in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania could have been reversed if more Democratic-leaning voters had turned out, if fewer voters had selected a third party candidate or if fewer voters chose no Presidential candidate, voting only in down ballot races.\n\nRelated: Will Democrats Stand Up to Trump? Here’s Their First Test\n\nThis last phenomenon – large number of voters declining to choose a Presidential candidate - was so unusual that it triggered demands for a recount. In Michigan, for example, 75,000 ballots did not include a Presidential preference, compared to a margin of just 11,000 votes separating the two major candidates. As far as we can tell, these blank votes weren’t caused by errors or fraud: they were the result of voters who disliked both candidates so much that they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for the lesser of two evils.\n\nThis is testimony to Clinton’s unattractiveness as a candidate. Hundreds of thousands of voters across the country repelled by Trump and unwilling to vote third party still could not convince themselves to vote for Clinton, despite her depth of experience and centrist platform. These voters, along with others who didn’t show up or voted for Jill Stein, could not accept Clinton’s cozy relationship with corporate interests, the whiff of corruption surrounding her family’s Foundation and her email controversies.\n\nPost-election, Democratic insiders have blamed the Russians and FBI Director James Comey for Clinton’s defeat. And I find that hard to argue: news arising from leaked DNC email messages could have easily cost Clinton 78,000 votes in three states, as could the last-minute reopening (and reclosing) of the FBI investigation.\n\nBut blaming external forces is not a solution for winning: all candidates risk running up against such headwinds, including Trump who managed to overcome a hot mic off-air recording that NBC should not have leaked. Between the 1930s and the 1980s, the Soviets intervened in US politics by supporting the Communist Party USA and beaming propaganda to us over short wave radio, so Putin’s actions in 2016 are nothing new – rather just a higher tech version of the same old thing. Comey had been painted into a corner: he had sworn during Congressional testimony to promptly notify Committee members if new evidence turned up, and the cache of Clinton emails found on Anthony Weiner’s computer counted as such evidence.\n\nRelated: The Power of the Pink Hat: Here’s How Democrats Can Win America Back\n\nRather than blaming these circumstances, Democrats should have chosen a candidate not vulnerable to the contents of a disgraced former Congressman’s hard drive. And the DNC and Clinton Campaign should not have written email messages that could later be used against them. Remember that the Democratic National Convention last August was initially rocked by revelations that DNC staff were trying to figure out how to stop Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe DNC and Democratic leadership seemed bent on protecting Clinton from serious primary opposition. This turned out to be a gross misjudgment. While the Republican process consisting of 17 candidates hurling mud at one another seemed ugly, it ultimately served a purpose. Jeb Bush, a weak candidate with strong establishment support, was winnowed out as were others that seemed to check all the boxes but weren’t ready for prime time. Trump emerged from this messy process by demonstrating that he had the will to win and the ability to motivate a large base of support.\n\nBy contrast, Hillary’s support was a mile wide and an inch deep. And the warning signs of her potential downfall were with us from the beginning of her primary campaign. News of her email server and her clumsy, shifting explanations for it date back to mid-2015. The $225,000 Goldman Sachs speeches were also in the news long before the Iowa Caucus.\n\nBut instead of providing an opening for a stronger candidate to replace Clinton, Democratic Party leadership closed the doors to effective opposition. Compared to the Republicans, Democrats held fewer Presidential debates, sometimes scheduling them at low-viewership times. Donna Brazille even abused her post at CNN by feeding town hall questions to the Clinton campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Adopt a Democratic Plan to Crack Down on Drug Prices\n\nThe fact that Bernie Sanders, who came from outside the party with a far left agenda was able to mount a major challenge to Clinton was another sign of her weakness as a candidate. But now that we have entered the post mortem period, Democrats are in danger of learning the wrong lessons from Sanders’ success. On the unproven assumption that Sanders would have defeated Trump last November, they conclude that Democrats need more progressive candidates going forward to excite the base.\n\nBut for every base voter they motivate, hard left candidates may turn off more than one middle of the road voter. The Democrats last experience with a far left candidate – George McGovern in 1972– did not end well: he lost 49 states. The British Labour Party offers its own cautionary tales. The Tories remained in power from 1979 to 1997 largely because Labour did not move toward the middle. Only when Tony Blair proclaimed New Labour and ended the party’s support for nationalizing the means of production, was the party able to defeat the Conservatives, Labour is now repeating this mistake under its far left leader Jeremy Corbyn, failing to capitalize on Tory disorder in the wake of the Brexit vote and David Cameron’s resignation.\n\nI do not believe Sanders would have defeated Trump, but I am pretty sure that Obama or Biden could have. Indeed, Martin O’Malley may have beaten Trump as well. The takeaway is that a center left candidate, advocating an approach similar to Clinton’s, but with a cleaner record and better able to connect with voters would have won in 2016 and will be best positioned to defeat Trump in 2020.\n\nThis column was mistakenly posted under Mark Thoma's byline originally.

    "text": "As federal officials across the nation and in foreign airports dealt with the impact of President Trump’s order banning refugees and nationals of seven foreign nations from entering the United States, the message his communications team brought to the public on Sunday was a simple question: What’s the big deal?\n\nDespite the large protests taking place at international airports across the country, where demonstrators demanded that officials allow legal permanent residents and refugees holding valid visas, Trump’s closest advisers portrayed the detentions as minor inconveniences that were well worth the price of protecting Americans from terrorism.\n\nRelated: Trump Pratfalls Onto the World Stage Targeting Muslims, Mexico, and Iraq’s Oil\n\nAppearing on Fox News Sunday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway insisted that the number of people affected by the ban was trivial in relation to the number who actually entered the country from foreign nations on Saturday.\n\n“With the upside being greater protection of our borders and our people, it’s a small price to pay,” she said.\n\nTelevision screens across the country have been full of images of children and elderly people detained at airports, and distraught men and women who learned that members of their families — some abroad visiting relatives, and others in possession of valid travel visas — wouldn’t be allowed back into the United States.\n\nConway ridiculed the idea that there was any serious disruption taking place.\n\n“This whole idea that they’re being separated, and ripped from their families? It’s temporary,” she said. “And it’s just circumstantial in terms of whether you were one of those three hundred and some that was already on an aircraft or trying to get on an aircraft as opposed to the more than 3,000 children who will be forevermore separated from their parents who perished on 9/11.”\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Plans to Take On China in Asia?\n\nOther administration spokespersons toed a similar line. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the detentions of travelers amounted to a minor inconvenience, and besides, he said, nobody should be surprised because President Trump “is doing exactly what he told the American people he would do.”\n\nTrump did spend his presidential campaign promising to impose “extreme vetting” on people entering the U.S. from foreign countries.\n\nHowever, Spicer and other Trump spokespeople are consistently insisting that there was virtually no system in place to clear refugees coming from war-torn places like Syrian.\n\nSpicer likened the current system to “an open door to let people march right into our country.”\n\nThis is utterly false, as multiple experts have testified. The United States’ refugee resettlement program involves intensive scrutiny of applicants that can take several years to complete. Yet it’s a line the administration is apparently sticking with, even as the plan comes under continued legal and public assault. Federal judges on Saturday issued stay orders preventing the deportation of people in the U.S. with valid visas and legal permanent residence status.\n\nRelated: Here’s What the US Imports From Mexico – and Who Would Pay Trump’s 20% Tax\n\nConway, in her appearance on Fox, suggested the ruling was politicized, and suggested that it somehow doesn’t apply to the administration’s action. “[The] Obama appointee judge in Brooklyn’s stay order really doesn’t affect the executive order at all,” she insisted.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus further muddied the water regarding treatment of green card holders, saying at different points that the executive order both would and would not apply to them going forward.\n\nWhile Republican lawmakers have been generally supportive of Trump’s actions so far, some cracks were starting to appear Sunday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he was against both a religious test for entry to the United States and against preventing people like Iraqi interpreters who had helped U.S. soldiers from entering the country.\n\n“Some of our best sources against radical Islamic terror are Muslims,” he said in an interview on Fox. He added, “It will be up to the courts to decide if this went too far.”"

    "text": "Major insurers say they could adjust to a major upheaval in the health care markets if Republicans make good on their pledge to simultaneously repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a plausible new plan.\n\nBut if Republicans fail to develop a replacement plan in timely fashion – which increasingly appears to be the case – then insurers will either bail out of the individual health insurance market in 2018 or jack up premiums by as much as 15 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRelated: Repeal and Replace Obamacare in 200 Days? Good Luck With That\n\nThese are some of the findings of a new survey of 13 health insurance companies in 28 states conducted by Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance reforms and funded by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThe insurance companies generally agreed that a repeal and delay strategy – in which Congress votes to dismantle key portions of Obamacare effective at a future date without a concurrent replacement -- would destabilize the individual insurance market.\n\nInsurers told researchers that without a replacement plan, premium increases next year could range as high as 20 percent – similar to the average premium increases for 2017 that were widely mocked by Republican critics and cited as a reason for dismantling Obamacare.\n\nIn particular, the individual market would likely be destabilized if Congress eliminates Obamacare premium subsidies for lower income Americans, the individual mandate targeted at forcing younger people to sign up for insurance, and federal cost-sharing to protect insurance companies from significant financial losses.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\n“With 13.8 million people projected to enroll in marketplace plans in 2017, the uncertain future of the ACA is of concern to the insurance industry,” Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who took part in the study, said in a statement Friday. “While insurers are confident they can adjust to new regulations given enough transition time between the ACA and its replacement, a lack of clarity from policymakers could mean that consumers will lose coverage or face dramatically higher premiums.”\n\nWhile a substantial transition or buffer period to adjust to new GOP regulations would be helpful, the insurers said, there was no consensus on how long such a period should be.\n\nThe study comes as congressional Republicans wound up a three-day policy retreat in Philadelphia in which party leaders mapped out timelines for action this year for replacing a four-year old program that insures more than 20 million Americans, but without providing clarity on how they would do that.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) outlined a schedule calling for the Republican controlled Congress to wrap up work on simultaneous repeal and replace legislation no later than the first 200 days of the new Congress and Trump administration.\n\nYet the Republicans just missed a January 27 deadline for the House and Senate Budget Committees to assemble repeal legislation and present it to members for action. That has now been put off until late March, raising suspicions that the repeal and replace campaign might be losing a little steam.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Problem With Trump’s Plan to Sell Health Insurance Across State Lines\n\nJames Wallner, a vice president for research at the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote in the Daily Signal that while the Jan. 27 deadline was not binding, “The fact that congressional Republicans are unable to meet this deadline suggests that they may be less committed to repealing Obamacare than previously expected.”\n\nWhat’s more, if rank-and-file Republicans were hoping for a detailed description of what the GOP replacement plan will look like, they were in for a disappointment. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) told reporters at the start of the retreat on Wednesday that lawmakers were clamoring for “exact, specific and detailed” information.\n\n“We’re going to own this stuff and we better be able to explain it,” he said, suggesting that he and other lawmakers are beginning to feel heat from constituents fearful of losing their coverage.\n\nInstead, they received fragmented descriptions of key elements of the GOP approach, including a system of refundable tax credits based on age to help cover premium costs, state-based high risk pools to subsidize the coverage of the oldest and sickest patients, and tax-exempt health care savings accounts.\n\nDuring his 25-minute address to the Republicans yesterday, Trump once again denounced Obamacare as “a disaster.” But he didn’t discuss his own ideas for a replacement, after boasting a week and a half ago that he was on the verge of unveiling his own plan for providing insurance “for everybody” with more choices and at a lower cost than under Obamacare.\n\nRep. Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and one of the architects of the Republicans’ emerging health care plan, cautioned that repeal and replacement of Obamacare would be handled piecemeal because of restrictions under House and Senate rules. That means that some of the initiatives would be handled as part of a special, filibuster-proof budget resolution pending in the two chambers, with the rest handled later this year through a more traditional legislative process.\n\n“Those who think we’re going to suddenly appear with a 2,000-page replacement bill are mistaken,” Walden told The Washington Post Thursday.\n\nMeeting behind closed doors in Philadelphia on Thursday, a number of Republican House and Senate members voiced sharp concerns about the consequences of their party’s quick push to repeal Obamacare, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n“We’d better be sure that we’re prepared to live with the market we’ve created” with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), according to the recording. “That’s going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we’ll be judged in the election less than two years away.”"

    "text": "In the whirlwind of activity punctuating the first week of the Trump administration, the sheer volume of new policies and pronouncements from the president and his staff made it difficult to focus on the larger picture. But by the end of the day Friday, when President Trump signed a ban on refugees entering the country, its embarrassingly chaotic rollout became the major story of the weekend.\n\nAs damaging as the ban might be to the United States’ standing in the Middle East and to Washington’s moral authority regarding the treatment of refugees, it masks the litany of executive orders issued by Trump this week that soured the relationship between this country and the rest of the world.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Plans to Take On China in Asia?\n\nThat’s not to say the disastrous executive order doesn’t deserve the attention. Trump’s plan not only bars all refugees from entering the country -- specifically singling out Syrians, who are undergoing one of the most horrific humanitarian disasters in recent memory -- but also blocks entry to the residents of seven entire countries, all majority Muslim.\n\nAnd, in a move that seemed almost intended to promote the idea that the US is against Muslims in general, Trump also announced that one of the few exceptions to the refugee resettlement ban would be Christians living in majority Muslim countries.\n\nBy Saturday morning there were reports of legal permanent residents of the US -- some of them parents of children who are citizens -- being denied re-entry to the country they and their families call home. Refugees nearing the end of a clearance process that takes two years were sent back to the wretched camps where tens of thousands of them have lived for years.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon the retaliation began. Iran barred all US citizens from entering its country, meaning that Iranian Americans with family in the Islamic Republic will not be able to visit them.\n\nRelated: Here’s What the US Imports From Mexico – and Who Would Pay Trump’s 20% Tax\n\nWhile that might seem like quite enough, the Trump administration did more than just antagonize half the Middle East in its first week in power. Trump’s newly-confirmed United Nations ambassador, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, announced her arrival at the international body with all the subtlety of a hand grenade.\n\n“You’re going to see a change in the way we do business,” she said in brief remarks to the media. “Our goal with the administration is to show value at the U.N., and the way we’ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well.”\n\n“For those who don’t have our back,” she added ominously, “we’re taking names; we will make points to respond to that accordingly.”\n\nRelated: Trump Just Blew His Chance to Renegotiate NAFTA\n\nHaley's warning followed the new president’s decision to start a Twitter fight with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the border wall that Trump insists he will build and force Mexico to pay for. Trump goaded Pena Nieto into canceling a meeting this week between the two men by claiming Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nThen Trump hit again. He sent his press secretary out to tell reporters he was planning to institute a 20 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, sending the value of the country’s currency plunging.\n\nIn addition to threatening a trade war with the United States’ third-largest trading partner, Trump repeatedly insisted that he plans to reconsider US participation in a vast array of trade pacts, claiming it would be in the best interests of the US to negotiate bilaterally with every country in the world. His words left both markets and foreign leaders nervous about the future of global commerce.\n\nTrump also hosted his first meeting with the leader of a major US ally when British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House. The Trump team misspelled May’s first name, conflating it with that of a British pornographic actress. During the joint press conference after they met, Trump again repeated his insistence that torture, which is outlawed by the US government and has been deemed ineffective by Trump’s newly confirmed Defense Secretary, General James Mattis, is an effective and legitimate means of extracting information from captured enemies.\n\nRelated: Mass Departures at the State Department as Trump Era Begins\n\nBy Saturday, it was almost possible to forget that earlier in the week Trump had suggested that the United States might get “another chance” to invade Iraq and take the country’s oil, and his claim that people who point out that this would be a war crime are “fools.”\n\nThe great danger here is that while Americans, faced with a blizzard of Trump coverage, may lose track of all the countries the new president has threatened, insulted, and bullied, those countries and their leaders surely won’t. And it will be at the top of their minds the next time an American diplomat asks for help or cooperation."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/27/31-Billion-Digital-System-Threatens-National-Security-Shut-Down",
    "text": "For now, at least, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has prevailed in shuttering a costly automated immigration naturalization processing system that he found has compromised national security.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ new Electronic Immigration System, ELIS, was supposed to speed up the cumbersome, complex and manual system for processing immigrants seeking legal status after 11 years of development and $3.1 billion of government spending. A total of approximately 240,000 citizenship and naturalization “N-400 forms” were fed into ELIS between April and August 2016.\n\nRelated: Homeland Security Just Gave Trump a New Reason to Build the Wall\n\nBut as DHS Inspector General John Roth documented in a report last November, the presumed state-of-the-art computer system had to be shut down because of a spate of technical and design problems that led to frequent power outages, lost casework, the inability of ELIS to access or add information to existing digital platforms, and even mistaken cancelations of applicants’ hearing dates.\n\nWorst of all, ELIS was so highly flawed that it granted citizenship or legal status to people who “pose national security threats,” Roth said. Not only could ineligible immigrants be approved, he discovered, but immigration officials often didn’t know if they had a criminal record or ties to terrorism.\n\nIn a stunning breach of security, ELIS had erroneously issued nearly 20,000 green cards, granting legal status to live and work in the U.S. to people who had not been properly vetted, according to the inspector general.\n\nRoth said he had received assurances from USCIS that it would continue to mothball the pricey computer system in favor of more traditional, manual paper shuffling until the multitude of problems had been ironed out. But late last week, he sounded an alarm after learning that Leon Rodriguez, Director of USCIS, intended to resume operation of ELIS before all the kinks were worked out.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US? Paul Ryan Says No\n\nRoth was furious because he had issued multiple warnings over many months to Rodriguez who had not only ignored Roth’s recommendation but denied the problem, according to a report in NextGov. In effect, Roth issued a cease and desist order to keep USCIS from bringing ELIS back online.\n\nLate Thursday, a spokesperson for USCIS told The Fiscal Times that his organization had backed away from any plans to reboot ELIS late this month until all of the technical problems had been ironed out.\n\n“USCIS reverted to using its legacy system to process naturalization applications in August 2016 while appropriate steps were taken to correct deficiencies identified within the Electronic Immigration System (ELIS),” said Daniel Cosgrove, the spokesperson, in an email. “All applications for naturalization received by USCIS are being adjudicated. USCIS will not return to processing new naturalization applications in ELIS until these issues are fully addressed.”\n\nThe USCIS statement didn’t address Roth’s concerns that tens of thousands of green cards had been issued to applicants without proper vetting."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/27/Trump-Might-Adopt-Democratic-Plan-Crack-Down-Drug-Prices",
    "text": "President Trump complained that the major pharmaceutical companies are “getting away with murder” and vowed to crack down on soaring drug prices that are draining the pockets of consumers and the coffers of Medicare and other federal health care programs.\n\nTrump has not unveiled a concrete plan for addressing the problem, although, during the campaign, he proposed allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada to enhance competition. He also favors allowing Medicare officials to negotiate prices with the major drug companies by eliminating the non-negotiating ban.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\n“I’m going to bring down drug prices,” Trump said in an interview with Time magazine that rattled the pharmaceutical industry. “I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”\n\nPerhaps even more worrisome for PhRMA and its long-time GOP allies on Capitol Hill is that Trump has begun conferring with a prominent senior House Democrat who has waged war with the drug companies for years and co-sponsored one of the toughest price control bills in Congress.\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders (IT) last year to highlight the most outrageous examples of price gouging and to fuel an election-year drive for congressional intervention. They called for harsher penalties and sanctions for price fixing, greater transparency in companies’ marketing strategies, and opening the borders to cheaper drugs from overseas.\n\nTrump told Cummings at the inaugural luncheon at the Capitol last Friday that the two needed to meet to discuss the high cost of prescription drugs, according to media reports confirmed by the congressman’s spokesman. Then Trump called Cummings on Wednesday morning to briefly confer about runaway drug prices and what could be done to rein them in.\n\nThe 20 Most Expensive Prescription Drugs in America\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry’s main trade group, recently told the Fiscal Times that “Government mandates and interventions are not the solutions for patients.”\n\nYet the fact that Trump spoke directly with Cummings twice in less than a week about drug prices suggests that the new president is getting ready to jettison traditional GOP opposition to direct government action, as The Hill noted this week.\n\nPrescription drug prices have risen at a double-digit rate in recent years and are projected to continue to rise at that clip this year. The overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow by 11.6 percent in 2017, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Specialty drugs for treating cancer, the Hepatitis-C virus and other life-threatening diseases are projected to increase 18.7 percent.\n\nThe country has been treated to a rogue’s gallery of price gouging pharmaceutical companies over the past two years. Those include Mylan Pharmaceutical, maker of the EpiPen drug dispenser for allergic children; Gilead Sciences, a manufacturer of two biometric wonder drugs for treating the Hepatitis-C virus, and Turing Pharmaceutical, formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, the notorious hedge fund manager.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nCummings could not be reached for comment on Thursday about his conversations with Trump. However, if Trump is interested in pursuing the Democrats’ ideas for bringing down costs, Cummings and Sanders have provided a road map that in some ways overlaps with Trump’s own ideas.\n\nTheir Prescription Drug Affordability Act introduced in late 2015 has four main components:\n\nIt would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies to bring down costs for Medicare drug benefits and lift that prohibition from 2003 Medicare Part D law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat prohibition provided major pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in windfall profits that Cummings and Sanders want to end. Some analysts say Medicare could save more than a half trillion dollars over the coming decade by tough negotiations with drug companies. Trump would clearly be in favor of such a move.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would provide for much tougher penalties for drug companies that commit fraud in pricing their products. In recent years, many major pharmaceutical companies have been convicted of civil or criminal fraud but treated their fines and settlements as the cost of doing business. The bill would significantly increase fines and other penalties for wrongdoing. Trump hasn’t spoken out on this yet.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nIt would prohibit the practice of brand-name drug makers paying competitors to keep lower-priced generic substitutes off the market to avoid competition and enable them to freely raise prices. The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that this so called “pay-for-delay” practice is costing consumers and taxpayers about $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.\n\nUnder the Cummings-Sanders approach, a drug company convicted of such fraudulent activities would lose its market exclusivity on the drugs they sell. Presumably, the government would pave the way for the introduction of a generic brand alternative. This, too, is not part of Trump’s approach so far.\n\nRelated: The Feds Finally Make a Move on Soaring Drug Prices\n\nFinally, the bill would allow individuals, pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed Canadian pharmacies where drug prices are 40 percent lower per person than they are in the U.S. Trump frequently mentioned this approach throughout the campaign.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute, said on Thursday, “Clearly the traditional Republican stance on government price controls is negative,” he said in an interview. “Anything that the White House might want to do with regards to price controls would almost certainly run through legislation.”\n\nRelated: Extreme Rise in Some Drug Prices Reaches a Tipping Point\n\nIn early February, Cummings lectured Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, over his decision to boost the price of Daraprim, a drug that had been on the market for years to treat a rare parasitic disease, by over 5000 percent. \"Drug company executives are lining their pockets at the expense of some of the most vulnerable families in our nation,\" Cummings said, while Shkreli smirked. \"It's not funny, Mr. Shkreli. People are dying, and they're getting sicker and sicker.\"\n\nCummings, 66, a highly regarded veteran House member, told Business Insider, “I have absolutely no problem with companies making a reasonable profit. Nor do I have an issue with them being able to recover their R&D. But there comes a point here where price hikes have nothing to do with R&D and have nothing to do with reasonable profit.”\n\n“I think companies that are doing the right thing ought to be joining me in looking for the Shkrelis of the world,” he added. “They ought to be screaming at the top of their lungs because what it does is it gives the entire industry a bad image.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/27/Trump-Just-Blew-His-Chance-Renegotiate-NAFTA",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s determination to upend the accords that frame American trade policy are taking root. Even before Trump spiked the Trans–Pacific Partnership on Monday, the White House had signaled that the new president would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, “the worst trade deal in the history of this country,” as Trump called it on the campaign trail last year.\n\nIf that’s debatable, so is the prospect that, managed badly, this could produce the worst outcome on the trade side since the Smoot–Hawley Tariff helped turn a recession into a depression in 1930.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\nNAFTA, implemented in stages from 1994 to 1998, is a three-sided accord opening America’s borders with Mexico and Canada, and there’s no question it fundamentally reshaped economic ties across the board.\n\nWhile Canada’s a major trading partner, the U.S. merchandise deficit was a very modest $15 billion in 2015. (Add in services, and the U.S. ran a surplus.) At this point Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is ducking for cover; he has already indicated that he’s willing to supersede NAFTA with a bilateral accord if that’s what things come to.\n\nMexico’s the pebble in Trump’s shoe, as he has long made plain. They run an annual merchandise surplus with the U.S. of almost $60 billion; when an American plant pulls up stakes in the Midwest, it’s almost always to set up south of the border.\n\nTrump’s not wrong to complain that NAFTA has led to American job losses. The Economic Policy Institute puts the figure at 700,000; the Council on Foreign Relations cites 600,000.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\nMore saliently, in my view, NAFTA has put Americans in unfair competition with workers in a completely different economic context. Having thus disarmed Americans at the bargaining table, NAFTA is effectively complicit in the wage stagnation and worsening income inequality evident over the last couple of decades.\n\nBut Trump betrays two potentially fatal problems, both symptoms of his profound lack of sophistication in diplomacy and international economics.\n\nOne, by signing an executive order Wednesday to begin his border wall, just as President Enrique Peña Nieto was about to begin a state visit, Trump just repeated the same mistake he recently made with the Chinese. The wall is to U.S.–Mexican ties as Taiwan or the South China Sea are to Sino–U.S. ties.\n\nMixing touchy politics, sovereignty, and national pride with economic and commercial problems is a mistake almost by definition. As a result, Peña Nieto, under intense political pressure at home, canceled his visit Thursday morning and is talking a much tougher game on NAFTA, immigration, and other such issues.\n\nTwo, and again as with China, Trump entertains a grossly simplistic notion of NAFTA’s mechanics, its plusses and minuses, and the prospect of reshaping it to better U.S. advantage.\n\nRelated: Who Will Really Pay for the Wall? GOP Struggles Over $12 Billion Price Tag\n\nTrump has said little about what he wants to emerge from a renegotiated NAFTA, but his proposed 20 percent tariff on imports from Mexico will be met with countervailing duties on imports from the U.S.\n\nThat’s called a trade war.\n\nTrump doesn’t seem to understand even the rudiments of supply-chain manufacturing structures and related production practices. Products “made” in Mexico may have components made in U.S. factories and shipped across the border. And vice-versa. What will happen if supply chains are disrupted? In all likelihood, U.S. companies will resort to another low-wage producer with whom the White House isn’t picking a fight.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s not taking the lesson he should have when Carrier consented not to shift some factory production to Mexico after Trump’s election victory. Increasing U.S. manufacturing production does not equal increases in American jobs—not any longer. Many jobs that Carrier won’t send to Mexico will be automated in Indiana. Trump may revive U.S. manufacturing to one or another degree—or oversee the trend, anyway—but the big winners will be production-floor robots.\n\nAlthough trade among the NAFTA signatories has tripled, the agreement has had a surprisingly modest impact on GDP growth. On balance, there is too little in it to protect workers, towns, and cities from the negative fallout that was perfectly predictable.\n\nBut 23 years later, it’s hard to see how Trump can do much more than ameliorate a few of the negative consequences unless he wants to risk a trade war or some other unimaginable mess."

    "text": "White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters travelling with the president on Thursday that President Donald Trump has decided to pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico by levying a 20 percent tax on all imports from that country.\n\nHowever, there is considerable confusion over what exactly the White House is proposing. Spicer said that the tariff would be enacted as part of broader tax reform. And the Republicans in the House of Representatives are considering a proposal that would create a border-adjusted tax of 20 percent on imports. But the House proposal would apply to all imports, while Spicer appeared to be talking only about Mexican goods.\n\nRelated: Before the Wall -- 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border\n\nTrade policy isn’t normally announced in the press gaggle on Air Force One, so the details of what’s really going on are difficult to determine at the moment. What’s clear though, is that slapping a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports would raise prices on an awful lot of things that U.S. consumers buy every day.\n\nAccording to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Mexico is the United States’ third-largest trading partner, with $587 billion in goods and services crossing the border in 2015. That breaks down to $267 billion in American goods and services exported to Mexico and $316 billion flowing the other way.\n\nIf the sellers of those $316 billion worth of products purchased by Americans are hit with a 20 percent increase in costs, they are going to do their best to pass that increased expense on to American consumers. And it will hit American checkbooks in multiple ways.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAccording to Commerce Department data, the U.S. imports from Mexico in 2015 were:\n\n* $74 billion in vehicles,\n\n* $63 billion in electrical machinery,\n\n* $49 billion in other machinery,\n\n* $14 billion in fuel and\n\n* $12 billion in medical instruments.\n\nMexico is also one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to the U.S., sending $21 billion worth of fruits, vegetables, beer, snack food and more across the border in 2015. Like your strawberries in February? Get ready to pay more for them.\n\nAnd there is every reason to expect that Mexico would hit back if Trump imposed an across-the-board tax on Mexican imports. U.S. exports to Mexico support an estimated 1.1 million jobs in this country, and American exporters would likely find their goods were suddenly less affordable for their Mexican customers.\n\nMexico is the second largest importer of U.S.-manufactured goods, and according to the Commerce Department, the same kinds of things that cross the border going north also cross it going south. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, “The top export categories ... in 2015 were: machinery ($42 billion), electrical machinery ($41 billion), vehicles ($22 billion), mineral fuels ($19 billion), and plastics ($17 billion).”\n\nRelated: Did Trump Just Say That Only Fools Honor the Geneva Conventions?\n\nMexico is the third-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural products as well, with $18 billion in produce and meat shipped south in 2015.\n\nAgain, it is not completely clear how serious the administration is about applying an import tax specifically to Mexico. But a couple of things are clear.\n\nIf Trump intends to effectively tax Mexican goods in order to raise money for the wall, it won’t be Mexico paying for it, as he long promised, it will be American consumers.\n\nAnd if Mexico retaliates against U.S. exporters, costing them sales and perhaps jobs, the American people will have paid for it twice."

    "text": "At a time when “fake news” and “alternative facts” are a dominant theme in American political discourse, a group of academic economists has come together in what they are describing as an effort to make sure voters and policymakers have access to verifiably true information about the state of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe EconoFact Network, as the group calls themselves, is the brainchild of economist Michael W. Klein, who holds the William L. Clayton professorship of International Economic Affairs at Tufts University. He said that the project, which officially launched last weekend, grew out of his frustration with the content of the public debate during and after the presidential election in which, he said, “so little seems to be based on real facts and serious policy analysis.”\n\nRelated: Who Will Really Pay for the Wall? GOP Struggles Over $12 Billion Price Tag\n\nKlein, who also has some experience in Washington, having served for 18 months as chief economist in the Treasury Department’s Office of International Affairs in the Obama administration, assembled a group of more than 30 economists from universities across the country. They all agreed to provide short, factual memos on issues of national interest, written in language accessible to the layman. The memos are published on Econofact.org.\n\nAccording to the group’s mission statement, “The contributing economists are encouraged to present their own conclusions or policy recommendations at the end of their memos, but only after laying out the authoritative data and facts and stating the trade-offs that different choices entail. Our network of economists might disagree with each other on policy recommendations, but all will similarly rely on widely agreed upon facts in their analysis.”\n\nKlein said the project is, in part, an effort to push back on what he and his colleagues see as the “pernicious” problem of media reporting on economic issues that supports what they see as “false equivalence.”\n\n“What we’re pushing against is this idea of a false equivalence,” he said. “There is a tendency often in the media to present two sides of a view even if the great preponderance of the evidence is on one side.”\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nHe described a personal experience with the press when he was approached by a television booker to speak about international trade issues. There was broad consensus among economists with regard to the subject, but the producer informed him that the program was looking for a contrary voice. Klein demurred, but when the program aired, he was horrified to see that for a discussion about an issue that most economists considered settled, the producers had given equal weight to the positions of a lone contrarian and an economist speaking on behalf of the vast majority of the field.\n\nIn less than a week of operation, the Econofact Network has produced several of its policy memos, and paging through the site, a common theme arises: Most of the memos address claims made by President Trump or policy proposals that he and Republicans in Congress have put forward. They include the effect of a border wall with Mexico, the feasibility of the US economy growing at an annual rate of 4 percent, and whether or not China is a currency manipulator.\n\nIn many cases, the issues are ones on which Trump has repeatedly made claims that economists believe are false or dangerous. Klein insists that this doesn’t represent an effort to go after the incoming administration specifically, but is simply a product of the reality that Trump and congressional Republicans now effectively control all federal policymaking machinery.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\n“If the Democrats were coming out with a lot of policy proposals, we’d look at those as well,” he said.\n\nAnd if most of the analyses seem aimed at debunking and questioning, rather than supporting policy proposals? “The fact that it seems tilted one way could just be reflecting that these policies that are coming out don’t really line up with the way economists think the world works,” Klein said. “We’re not afraid of making our voices known.”\n\nHere’s one example, already on the site:\n\nBy David Deming, Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Graduate School of Education\n\nThe Issue: President Trump has promised to bring back manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe Facts:\n\nThe U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the 2000s. But job losses in manufacturing began more than 30 years ago and are happening worldwide in advanced countries like Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nU.S. manufacturing is booming with production at an all-time high, even as the number of manufacturing jobs has shrunk. This is because of automation. Factories in the United States and other advanced countries are making more with fewer workers.\n\nAutomation is happening in all sectors of the economy, but much more in manufacturing than in services.\n\nIn the short-term, infrastructure spending and public sector \"make work\" projects could help workers displaced by automation.\n\nWhat this Means: Convincing manufacturing companies to keep — or bring back — jobs, one company at a time, is not going to restore the millions of jobs that have been lost due to technological change. In the long-run, we should be thinking of ways to change our education system towards teaching skills that are harder for robots to replace and will give people good jobs at good pay in our modern economy."

Good Luck With That\n\nThe majority of voters would prefer that Congress keep the ACA in place and make new regulations to fix the parts that aren’t working.

That poll found that just 15 percent of primary care physicians favor a full repeal of the law, although nearly three-quarters believe that Congress should make some changes.\n\nAfter his inauguration last Friday, Trump took the first steps toward fulfilling his campaign promise to repeal and replace the law by signing an executive order instructing federal agencies to use any method allowed by law to dismantle key elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile the exact implications of the order remain unclear, congressional Republicans are scrambling to do the heavy lifting of coming up with a suitable plan to replace the law.

    "text": "Just one day before President Donald Trump is set to meet his first foreign leader since taking office, top-tier career staff in charge of the day-to-day management of the Department of State are leaving en masse, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe most senior among the managers leaving the department is Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary for management, according to the Post’s Josh Rogin. Others include assistant secretaries in charge of administration and consular affairs, and the director of the office of foreign missions.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\nThe departures come on the heels of other losses in the management division. On the day Trump was inaugurated, the assistant secretary in charge of diplomatic security announced his retirement, and the director of the office of overseas building operations resigned.\n\nThere appears to be some question about whether the career diplomats leaving the State Department are leaving of their own accord, or are being purged by the incoming administration. While the Post reports that these were voluntary departures, other outlets including CNN are reporting that the senior managers were effectively fired.\n\nWhatever the case, the unexpected departure of such a large percentage of senior managers who had served under both Republican and Democratic administrations comes at a time when there is broad nervousness within the State Department about the direction of policy under the new president. Trump’s unpredictability and his tendency to make bombastic pronouncements about both America’s allies and its adversaries have left the world guessing about his intentions in countless arenas.\n\nJust Thursday morning, in a wildly unprecedented breach of normal diplomatic courtesies, the new president used Twitter to suggest that the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, should cancel a planned visit to Washington to meet with Trump unless he agrees to pay for a massive wall the administration plans to build between the two countries.\n\nLater Thursday morning, the Mexican president responded in kind, cancelling what would have been the first meeting between them since Trump took office.\n\nRelated: Meet the Man Who Will Explain Trump to the World’s Great Economic Powers\n\nOnly days into his job, Trump’s new secretary of state, former Exxon-Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, now needs to find a way to address a tremendous combined loss of institutional memory at a time when the new administration is attempting to find its balance in its first months in office.\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet tomorrow with British Prime Minister Theresa May.

    "text": "Congressional Republican leaders disclosed Thursday that it would cost $12 billion to $15 billion to make good on President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to build a “big, beautiful” security wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But they didn’t say how they will pay for it.\n\nMeeting with reporters in Philadelphia where Republican lawmakers are holding a policy retreat, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said they would await a request from the Trump administration for a supplemental spending request to build a barrier that Trump insists is critical to U.S. security but that critics say is a colossal waste of precious federal resources.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAs the GOP-controlled Congress begins to face up to a pile of costly Trump campaign pledges – from deep tax cuts and new highways and bridges to constructing a wall along the southern border – Ryan and McConnell are facing mounting questions about how they would achieve all of that without driving up the national debt.\n\nPressed by one reporter to assure the Republicans weren’t heading for a new debt crisis with all the spending on their agenda, Ryan replied, “You know us well. We are fiscal conservatives. What that means is, we believe government should not live beyond its means,” Ryan said.\n\n“We believe that hard-working taxpayers in this country deserve a break in this country. And that means Washington takes less money from them, and we also spend less here. That means we have to get our fiscal house in order to prevent a debt crisis in the future.” Ryan added that the Republicans could do much in “moving us in a great direction” on the fiscal front this year by repealing and replacing Obamacare and spurring the creation of new jobs.\n\nRelated: Before the Wall, 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border\n\nBut neither McConnell nor Ryan would say whether Congress would make offsetting cuts in other areas of the budget to placate Trump’s demand for swift action on the wall, a costly architectural feat that could take years to complete to tighten control along the border and halt the flow of illegal immigrants into this country.\n\n“We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,” Trump told a group of Department of Homeland Security employees in announcing an executive order to build the wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border and winding path of the Rio Grande. “Beginning today, the United States gets control of its borders.”\n\nTrump insisted throughout the presidential campaign and in the early days of his new administration that Mexico would ultimately pick up the tab for building the wall despite President Enrique Pena Nieto insistence that his government would never pay for the wall. More recently, he said that Congress would have to use taxpayer funds to cover the initial cost of the project, but that Mexico would ultimately pay back the U.S.\n\nRelated: There’s Less to Trump’s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest\n\nTrump said in an interview with ABC News last night that construction would begin “as soon as we can physically do it – I would say in months.” He stressed, “We’ll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico,” adding, “I’m just telling you there will be a payment.”\n\nThe Mexican president who was roundly criticized at home for meeting with Trump in Mexico City in late August during the campaign was scheduled to confer with Trump at the White House next week for bilateral talks on trade and the wall. But Nieto canceled the meeting\n\nafter reaffirming on Wednesday that his country “will not pay for any wall.” As expected, Trump then took to Twitter:"

    "text": "The many Americans concerned about the future of the country under President Donald Trump likely found little reassurance in his first television interview, which aired on ABC Wednesday night. The hour-long exchange with reporter David Muir touched on a wide range of topics, from the president’s insistence that torturing people for information is both effective and acceptable to lengthy complaints about how the new commander in chief believes he has been treated by the news media.\n\nBut buried in the discussion of the size of the crowd at his inauguration, bogus claims of voter fraud and the president’s insistence that only Fox News covers him fairly, was a particularly chilling moment in which Trump expressed his complete contempt not just for people who oppose him on policy grounds, but for the international norms and rules of conduct that have helped keep the world in a state of relative peace for decades.\n\nRelated: Is This How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\nMuir brought up a comment Trump had made when speaking at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency earlier this week. He began by falsely claiming that he had been against the invasion of Iraq, and then went on to complain that the United States had not materially profited from the effective takeover of a foreign country.\n\n“The old expression, ‘to the victor belong the spoils’ -- you remember. I always used to say, ‘Keep the oil.’” He later added the cryptic, “Maybe you’ll have another chance. But the fact is, should have kept the oil.”\n\nOther than the veiled suggestion that the United States might take another bite at the Iraq apple under a Trump administration, the comment was not new. Trump has repeatedly said that he believes U.S. forces should have seized the country’s oil fields. However, it was the first time that he has said so as president, lending more seriousness to his advocacy of what is, beyond question, a war crime.\n\nPlundering an occupied country has been recognized as a violation of the laws of war since at least 1907. And article 33 of the fourth Geneva Convention dispenses with the idea that the U.S. can simply take ownership of Iraq’s oil fields in exactly three words: “Pillage is prohibited.”\n\nMuir pointed that out, and Trump’s response was strikingly blunt and visceral.\n\nDAVID MUIR: You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil. But I wanna get to the words ... that you ...\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Wait, wait, can you believe that? Who are the critics who say that? Fools.\n\nDAVID MUIR: Let, let me ...\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don't call them critics. I call them fools.\n\nTrumps critics, in this case, are not fools. They are simply people who can read. And at this point, Trump must know that he is advocating a literal violation of international law. To all appearances, he just doesn’t care, and he appears to be increasingly impatient with the suggestion that his judgement about what is acceptable and what is beyond the pale may be terribly wrong.\n\nRelated: Trump Cracks Down on Sanctuary Cities – and It Could Cost Them Billions\n\nAnd because he is now entrusted with nuclear weapon launch codes, the power of the national security surveillance state, and the most powerful military the world has ever known, that should really worry everyone."

    "text": "Congressional Republicans appear to have a new, fast-track timeline for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act that was outlined Wednesday on the first day of a three-day policy retreat in Philadelphia. Similar health-plan concepts by Paul Ryan and Tom Price, Trump's choice to head Health and Human Services, have been floated, but Senate democrats are unlikely to approve either one.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) outlined a 200-day legislative game plan in which the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress would repeal and replace major elements of Obamacare by April, before turning their attention to major tax reform.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nThe first step will be to complete work on a budget reconciliation package in the next couple of weeks by repealing Obamacare and replacing key portions of it, according to media reports.\n\nThen the really hard work begins when Republicans try to assemble a workable replacement plan that not only wins approval of GOP members but somehow attracts at least eight Democrats in the Senate whose votes will be needed to put it over the top.\n\nPolitico reported yesterday that Ryan had shared his timeline chart with President Donald Trump who gave it his rousing approval. The hard-charging new president promised to use the White House bully pulpit to help line up the needed votes in both chambers and quash opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who faces a much tougher challenge than Ryan in driving a replacement plan through the Senate, reportedly is less sanguine.\n\nFor all the optimism emanating from the GOP’s policy retreat in Philly, it should be emphasized that congressional and presidential timelines have been known to frequently slip rather dramatically.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Problem With Trump’s Plan to Sell Health Insurance Across State Lines\n\nTrump, of course, boasted to The Washington Post ten days ago that he and his advisers were on the verge of completing an Obamacare replacement plan providing “insurance for everybody.” He promised he would soon unveil it with Ryan and McConnell at his side.\n\n“It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes,” Trump told the newspaper. But we are still waiting to see that plan.\n\nA half-dozen more moderate Republicans in the Senate, including Bob Corker of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine, cautioned earlier this month that the process of replacing the Affordable Care Act could be long and perilous and they urged caution.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chair of the health committee, indicated that the process of voting to just replace Obamacare likely would take until the summer to complete. After that, he said, “it’ll probably take two or three years to implement [a replacement] over time.\"\n\nRelated: Tom Price Is Open to a Major Change in How Medicaid Works\n\nBut after Trump cracked the whip and said voters won’t tolerate anything but a rapid, near simultaneous repeal and replace action, Alexander and the others fell into line. Just about every Republican on Capitol Hill is now talking about a fast-track approach to wrap things up this year so that consumers and insurers aren’t left in the lurch.\n\nBut whether anyone has a real handle on how this health care saga will play out remains to be seen.\n\nWhat seems crystal clear at this point -- after more than six years of seeking the demise of the Affordable Care Act – is the Republicans are nowhere near a consensus on replacement legislation. The new Trump White House and congressional leaders appear to have plenty of random ideas for creating a more market-oriented, consumer friendly, less costly health insurance system.\n\nThere is plenty of talk about encouraging the interstate sale of insurance to encourage competition, more tax-exempt health savings accounts, refundable tax credits to help the rich and poor alike cover their premiums, “risk pools” for older and sicker insurance applicants and block granting Medicaid to cut costs and empower state officials.\n\nYet neither Trump nor Ryan nor McConnell can honestly point to an approach that would win the support of the health care, drug and insurance industries -- which must have buy-in -- as well as rank and file Republicans and their constituents throughout the country.\n\nAnd the heat is on from Republican governors, hospital administrators and insurers who fear that Trump and the GOP are leading the country into a health care abyss. Practically every day now, someone is stepping forward with a possible solution that promptly gets shot down.\n\nOn Wednesday, for instance, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul introduced the Obamacare Replacement Act, which he declared would create more affordable insurance plans, eliminate the gap between private and employer-sponsored care, and allow consumers to save unlimited amounts of money in health savings accounts, according to Morning Consult.\n\nEarlier in the week, Collins and GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana unveiled a plan they hoped would bridge the vast political divide on Capitol Hill by allowing blue states that are happy with Obamacare to keep coverage as it is, while allowing other red states that want to repeal the law and its mandates to create an alternative program with 95 percent federal funding.\n\nCritics on the right and the left both howled at the plan as being grossly inadequate, and Collins and Cassidy quickly retreated.\n\nA spokesman for Collins insists that Collins and Cassidy were not in retreat, and noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) signed onto their proposal on Wednesday. “Our plan represents a growing coalescence of Republican ideas on health care while returning power to states and fulfilling President Trump’s pledge to bring health care coverage for all,” Cassidy said in a statement.\n\n(This story was updated at 12:10 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 26.)"

    "text": "What’s more daunting than creating a massive federal entitlement program? Unwinding it with the least amount of damage to people and providers, as Republicans are learning about the Affordable Care Act. After seven years of opposing the ACA, forever known as Obamacare, the GOP finds itself in a position to finally fulfill their promises to repeal it entirely and replace it with market-based reforms.\n\nOver the past few weeks, since running the table in the 2016 election, Republicans on Capitol Hill began backing away from a firm commitment to “repeal and replace,” their mantra since the disastrous October 2013 rollout of the ACA exchanges. Murmurs of “repeal and delay” began swirling in Washington, even as now-president Donald Trump chose chief Obamacare opponent Tom Price to run Health and Human Services. Democrats began crowing “I told you so,” and started demanding that Republicans work with them to “fix’ the problems in the ACA.\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nThe daunting scope of the challenge, both practically and politically, has my good friend Matt Lewis wondering whether the effort is worth trying. Writing at The Daily Beast, Matt suggests that Republicans should retreat from the “thankless task of fixing America’s health care system.” The problem, Matt argues, is that the central argument of Obamacare has already been adopted by both sides – that the responsibility for universal health insurance coverage falls on the federal government.\n\n“Even President Donald Trump agrees with this promise of universal coverage,” Matt notes from Trump’s interview with The Washington Post. The ship has sailed on sending the issue back to the states or reforming the entire system on free-market grounds. The proliferation of alternatives makes the task a “Rubik’s Cube,” and “a fool’s errand that is almost guaranteed to backfire. Sometimes,” Matt concludes, “you have to punt.”\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans don’t have that as a realistic option – either politically or practically. They have fought Obamacare in four successive national elections, winning three of four and sweeping the field in 2016 to return to single-party governance in Washington DC. Trump and almost every Republican who ran for the House and Senate explicitly cited Obamacare repeal as a top priority. Punting on repeal in favor of a few incremental changes would only deepen the hostility and suspicion that the populist-minded grassroots on the Right already have for Republican leadership. The potential backlash could cost the GOP a chance to gain a large Senate majority in 2018, or possibly even control of the House.\n\nRelated: There’s Less to Trump’s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest\n\nPractically speaking, a punt won’t work because of the increasing instability in Obamacare exchanges. Democrats insisted that the ACA would deliver near-universal health insurance coverage and that 23 million Americans would get insurance through the exchanges by 2017. Instead, a new projection from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 10 million will pay premiums for coverage this year, and that number will only go up to 13 million after another decade. On top of that, the number of uninsured Americans will “remain around 27 million or 28 million” each year under the current system.\n\nThat makes it rather difficult to pin a failure to achieve universal coverage on a repeal of Obamacare and calls into question whether it’s a worthwhile goal. The Affordable Care Act has not just missed the mark on universal coverage, and the attempts to achieve it have made insurance coverage more unaffordable than ever thanks to massive premium increases (averaging 25 percent this year alone) and skyrocketing deductibles that make accessing insurance benefits all but impossible anyway.\n\nThus, the crisis has reached a pitch to where a choice to avoid governance no longer exists. Add in the flight of insurers from the exchanges and the collapse of the government-backed co-ops, and the acute need for action becomes undeniable, regardless of the difficulty. Failure to act is simply not an option any longer.\n\nFortunately, Republicans have already begun the process of working out an eventual replacement plan by introducing a few options this week. Senator Rand Paul offered his more libertarian approach on Wednesday, featuring a reliance on free-market innovation in coverage rather than mandates, interstate sales of policies, and broaden access to HSAs. His colleagues Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins offered a significantly different approach – giving each state the option to set up its own version of Obamacare, or choose a “free-market alternative.”\n\nRelated: The Sneaky Democratic Politics Behind the Scary New Obamacare Numbers\n\nThat approach still keeps in place some of the community-rating mandates while eliminating some of the other mandates on coverage, which makes it look like a bad system that has only been transferred to another level of government. Paul Ryan still has his “A Better Way” in the House, while Price will continue to work off his repeatedly offered legislation that closely resembles Ryan’s plan.\n\nSome may see this multitude of options as evidence of chaos and division. Instead, it’s part of the necessary process of working through all the options to get to a consensus solution, one that may well include various parts of all these approaches. Until Republicans gained control of Congress and the White House and replacement became a real possibility, few were willing to do this work and risk the potential political backlash. Now, with not just the possibility but necessity of replacing a collapsing and failing experiment in a command economy, this work can begin in earnest.\n\nAnd after this week, Republicans simply have no other choice. Trump’s executive order on Obamacare on Monday acted in the same manner as Hernando Cortes burning his boats at Veracruz, ensuring that the status quo would be untenable. Punting is no longer an option – and in truth, it never was."

    "text": "President Donald Trump took his first big steps on Wednesday towards strengthening the border and increasing the pressure on millions of illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nDuring an afternoon appearance at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump issued executive orders to authorize construction of a much ballyhooed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, hire 5,000 more border patrol agents, and restore a “secure communities” program that grants the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency wider latitude in targeting illegal immigrants for detainment and deportation.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nAnd in a retaliatory move against scores of cities across the country that have refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in detaining illegal immigrants, Trump ordered cuts in potentially billions of dollars’ worth of Department of Justice, Homeland Security and other federal grants to those communities.\n\n“We’re going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters. “The American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.”\n\nThe order, titled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” declares that cities that fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement agents “are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.”\n\nThe document also says that the director of the Office of Management and Budget will be responsible for obtaining “relevant and responsive information” on all federal grant money that currently flows to any sanctuary jurisdiction.\n\nWith an assist from the GOP-controlled Congress, Trump can punish as many as 300 “sanctuary cities” that are protecting illegal immigrant by cutting off grants of more than $1 billion a year from the Justice Department and $1 billion from the Department of Homeland Security, according to policy experts.\n\nRelated: Some Sanctuary City Officials Will Stonewall Trump Over Criminal Deportations\n\nThose grants range from funding for enhanced community policy services, criminal prosecution, sheltering battered women and compensating crime victims to urban area security initiatives, funding for first responders and even local and state efforts at border security, according to a summary compiled by USA Today.\n\nDemocratic mayors and police chiefs of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, among others, have long resisted federal demands for cooperation in tracking and detaining illegal immigrants. Now, as Trump begins to ramp up his promised crackdown on illegal immigrants and tightening of security, these ity officials are vowing not to cooperate with Trump’s plans to arrest and deport nearly a quarter of the 11 million illegal immigrants who have criminal records or are deemed dangerous to society.\n\nWithin days of Trump’s election last November, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio strongly signaled they would stand by their illegal immigrant populations. Emanuel created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. “Chicago will always be a sanctuary city,” Emanuel declared.\n\nSanctuary cities have been around since the 1980s, and they previously have come under fire from Republicans and even the Obama administration for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, or for adopting policies to assure that illegal immigrants and their families are provided with social services. Those cities came under fire again last year after a 32-year-old San Francisco woman, Kathryn Steinle, was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant with a felony record who had been deported five times.\n\nRelated: Is this How Trump Will Get Mexico to ‘Pay’ for His Wall?\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Trump’s choice as Attorney General, introduced a bill in 2015 aimed at cutting off Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nSessions can be counted on to aggressively implement Trump’s retaliatory executive order if he is confirmed to head the Justice Department. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) argued that the punishment should be broadened to include community and economic development funds.\n\nToomey introduced a bill in 2015 that would have denied sanctuary cities their share of roughly $3 billion a year in community development block grants and $238 million of economic development administration grants. The new administration might dust off that proposal.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Deport Millions of Illegal Immigrants with Criminal Records\n\nTrump complained this afternoon that many Americans have been victimized or killed by illegal immigrants, while millions of undocumented residents are “rewarded” with legal protection and social programs. “For years the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders,” Trump said. “To all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words: We hear you, we see you and you will never, ever be ignored again.”\n\nLazaro Zamora, a senior policy adviser and immigration expert with the Bipartisan Policy Center, describes the threat of a loss of funds a “meat-axe” approach to addressing a long-standing feud between federal and local officials that won’t be resolved through bitter fighting.\n\nTrump and his advisers are trying to enforce their immigration policies “by kind of bashing the states over the head with counter-productive measures that may just make everything worse and put state and local police officers in a more defensive position,” he said in an interview. “There is a long history here and there’s a lot of ego and territorial attitude in law enforcement, and part of that has been dealing with this issue of where is the line between federal immigration enforcement and police officers.”\n\nThere is little question Trump can punish sanctuary cities financially, and he appears determined to following through on his executive order. But in so doing, he may be punishing the very same local police and law enforcement officials he has vowed to champion as a “law and order” commander in chief.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\n“The devil is in the detail here,” said Laurie Robinson, a former Justice Department official who now teaches at George Mason University. “At a time when our law enforcement officers need support, it’s slightly counter-productive to cut the resources to police.”\n\nWhat’s more, she said, slashing Justice Department and Homeland Security grants to sanctuary cities and communities would have a serious, adverse impact on vocal and important constituencies, especially victims of crime who qualify for compensation.\n\n“That would be very, very sensitive because this is directly assisting crime victims, and that’s an extraordinarily strong constituency, a very vocal constituency, and one that has had strong support in the conservative community,” Robinson said, noting that the Justice Department crime victims assistance office was originally created by President Ronald Reagan."

    "title": "Why the Keystone XL Pipeline May Never Happen, Even With Trump's Approval",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Why-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-May-Never-Happen-Even-Trumps-Approval",
    "text": "President Donald Trump moved to fulfill one of his campaign promises on Tuesday, signing an executive order to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. The former had been rejected outright by the Obama administration while the latter had been given an indefinite delay.\n\nThe industry hailed the executive order, but just because President Trump wants to see the pipeline built does not mean TransCanada will move to break ground anytime soon. There are a number of uncertainties that could prevent construction from progressing.\n\nRelated: Environmentalists’ Worst Fears About Trump Are Coming True\n\nFirst, the President said that he would “renegotiate” the terms of the Keystone XL pipeline, presumably to get a “better deal” as he promised during the campaign. The specifics of “renegotiating” the pipeline are unclear – he also signed an executive order to expedite the environmental review process for major infrastructure projects, so it is not as if he has a problem with the pipeline’s route or environmental impact. “The regulatory process in this country has become a tangled mess,” President Trump said.\n\nBased on his comments during the presidential campaign, it would appear that he wants to ensure some of the oil flowing through the Keystone XL Pipeline would be consumed in the U.S. rather than be shipped to the Gulf of Mexico for export. Again, it is unclear what kind of requirements he wants to place on the project and how that might complicate the calculations for TransCanada.\n\nAnother complicating factor for the project is that President Trump signed a separate order calling for all pipelines to be constructed with American-made steel. If that order is binding on TransCanada, it is uncertain how that will affect the ultimate cost of the project.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups argue that the executive order does not resolve all legal questions surrounding both pipelines and have promised to resume the fight against the project. “President Trump appears to be ignoring the law, public sentiment and ethical considerations with this executive order aimed at resurrecting the long-rejected Keystone XL pipeline,” Trip Van Noppen, President of environmental group Earthjustice wrote in a statement. “He should brace himself to contend with the laws he is flouting, and the millions of Americans who are opposed to these dangerous and destructive projects. We will see his administration in court.”\n\nRelated: Quick action Trump could take on energy, environment, climate\n\nOn top of that, President Trump is proposing a border-adjustment tax as part of his larger tax reform push for this year. The idea is that products exported from the U.S. will be exempted from tax while at the same time companies will no longer be able to deduct the expenses of imports from their tax bill. The proposal is highly controversial and it would have huge ramifications for the oil industry.\n\nThe effects of such a tax would be complex, but would boil down to prioritizing U.S.-produced oil and gas, making oil from Canada less competitive. Oil from the U.S. shale patch would be priced at a premium to oil from abroad because of the tax. If such a tax were passed it would damage the prospects of oil exported through the Keystone XL Pipeline. President Trump would be pursuing one of his priorities at the expense of another.\n\nFinally, Canada has moved on since the Obama administration rejected the pipeline back in 2015. Just a few weeks ago the Canadian government gave the greenlight to Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion, which would nearly triple the volume of the pipeline’s existing line from 300,000 to 890,000 bpd, taking Alberta oil to the Pacific coast for export. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also approved Enbridge’s Line 3, a more than $7 billion overhaul of a pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin in the U.S., taking Canadian oil to Midwestern refineries. Enbridge’s project has received considerably less attention from environmental activists, but it would double the pipeline’s capacity to 760,000 bpd. The two pipelines together would add more capacity than Keystone XL would. The midstream market is different than it was back when Keystone XL was the only game in town. It is not at all clear that Keystone XL makes sense anymore with two major competing pipelines now moving forward.\n\nIn short, President Trump, with the stroke of a pen, has put Keystone XL back on the map. But it will take more than that for the pipeline to move forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com: Read more from OilPrice.com\n\nAramco Pulls Out Of Joint Venture Talks With Petronas\n\nIs Libya A Bigger Threat To Oil Prices Than U.S. Shale?\n\nDespite Trump’s Rhetoric: U.S. Needs OPEC Oil"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/How-Trump-Will-Get-Mexico-Pay-His-Wall",
    "text": "Since the earliest moments of his campaign for the White House, President Donald Trump has promised that he will build a wall on the Mexican border and that he will force the Mexican government to pay for it.\n\nThe promise to wring funds out of Mexico for a barrier meant to block its own people from entering the U.S. always seemed a bit far-fetched, and only became more so when the Mexican government angrily announced that it would never pay for Trump’s pet project. But Trump never stopped insisting that the funds for the wall would come from Mexico, even if he eventually began tweaking his explanation of how it would happen.\n\nRelated: Before the Wall, 18 Photos of the US-Mexico Border\n\nThe payment might not be a direct exchange of funds, he began suggesting over the past year, but might involve the U.S. extracting money from the Mexican government by other means. Later, he moved from the “will pay for” the wall to a “will reimburse us for the wall” argument. That change, he said, was so that construction could start right away.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News Monday, Trump said that he expects construction on the wall to begin within months and gave an even more convoluted explanation of how Mexico will “100 percent” be made to finance it.\n\n“All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico,” he told reporter David Muir. “I’m just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. What I’m doing is good for the United States. It’s also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, though, when he signed what the White House described as an executive order that would launch construction of the wall as well as significantly toughen border enforcement, Trump may also have dropped a more substantive hint about how he might be able to claim that Mexico “paid” for the project.\n\nRelated: Homeland Security Just Gave Trump an Alarming Reason to Tighten the Border\n\nBuried in the order is this direction to federal agencies:\n\n“The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.”\n\nIt goes on to submit that list to the secretary of state within 30 days. The order then gives the State Department another 60 days to “submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.”\n\nMexico is one of the larger but by no means the largest recipients of foreign aid from the United States. The Mexican government and military received nearly $420 million in assistance in 2013, with most of the money going to economic development.\n\nIt’s unclear from the text of the order what the purpose of the data collection is, but it is at least plausible that Trump is considering one of two possible courses of action. First, he could present the figures to Mexico and use the threat of withdrawal of the aid as leverage to compel some sort of payment for the wall.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US?\n\nAlternatively, he could cut out the middleman and just try to withhold aid payments until he feels he can make a credible case that Mexico has actually “paid” for the wall.\n\nWhatever the eventual plan, the move on Tuesday is certain to anger the United States’ southern neighbor. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is supposed to meet with Trump next week, but reports from the Mexican capital early Tuesday suggested that if Trump went forward with the executive order, he might cancel his trip to Washington."

    "text": "It is probably too early and too strong to say that parallel governments are emerging in Washington – one disturbing, the other reassuring – but in its first week, the Trump administration is showing two faces.\n\nRelated: US No Longer a ‘Full Democracy,’ but It’s Not Trump’s Fault: Report\n\nOn one side of the Potomac, there is the never-ending carnival that took the crazy train from Trump Tower to the White House: Kellyanne Conway spouts “alternative facts” and Sean Spicer plays the calliope as the stream-of-consciousness barker goes on about mounting an investigation into how the “illegals\" cost him the election, about crowd size at the inauguration, about going back into Iraq to snatch the oil, about “TheWall” and about whatever else pops into his presidential head.\n\nOn the other side, newly installed Defense Secretary James Mattis, the former Marine general whom some conservatives once talked about as a candidate to challenge Donald Trump, has hit the ground running like a gung-ho recruit on Parris Island.\n\nIn contrast to a White House said to be beset by back-biting and turf wars, Mattis appears to be thoughtfully assembling a team and making smart strategic moves. That may help offset the show on Pennsylvania Avenue that the wide-eyed world is watching -- sometimes appalled and trembling, sometimes pointing and giggling.\n\nAs the Military Times reported on Monday, Mattis has made three key appointments. Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work, another former Marine officer and a Pentagon professional who served in the Obama administration, has been asked to stay on to smooth the transition and manage the bureaucracy, at least for the short term.\n\nRear Admiral Craig Faller will be the chief uniformed adviser to Mattis. A combat veteran with deep experience in the Middle East and Asia, Faller once worked for the late Senator Ted Kennedy and has dealt with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as the Navy’s chief of legislative affairs.\n\nAs his chief of staff, Mattis has appointed retired Rear Admiral Kevin Sweeney, who the Military Times said is seen as a manager familiar with the inner workings of the Pentagon.\n\nRelated: How an Important NATO Ally Is Dealing With Putin -- and Trump\n\nMore important, the Military Times quoted a Pentagon spokesman as saying Mattis had reached out to NATO allies, including the NATO secretary general and the British and Canadian defense ministers. CNN said he reassured them of America’s “unshakeable commitment” to the alliance.\n\nThat was no doubt intended to counter-balance Trump, who rattled NATO with talk during the campaign about alliance partners not paying their fair share and has repeatedly offered warm words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, NATO’s chief antagonist.\n\nWhen asked about Mattis’ outreach, Press Secretary Spicer said on Tuesday: \"I think that Secretary Mattis and others have some ideas about how to reform and make organizations like NATO more effective and benefit the amount of money that the United States is putting [in] whether it's NATO or the UN or other organizations like that. But I think [Trump] is not pleased in terms of what he sees in terms of the U.S. contribution and the output it's getting.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership as he promised during the campaign, but as numerous news stories and commentaries have pointed out, one of the goals of TPP was to counter the influence of China. By pulling back from the 12-nation trade deal, the new President gives an opening to Beijing, whom he also repeatedly railed against on his way to the Oval Office.\n\nAlmost on cue, it was announced that Mattis will visit Japan and South Korea next month in his first official visit outside the U.S. as Defense Secretary. The purpose, according to The Financial Times, is to reassure America’s Asian allies.\n\nIn his first memo to the Defense Department, issued on Inauguration Day, Mattis also signaled that he would work closely with the Intelligence Community, which took a beating from Trump both as a candidate and as the president-elect. Even a conciliatory visit by the president to the CIA wound up hitting an off note, with Trump standing in front of a wall commemorating fallen and largely unsung officers to complain about the media distorting attendance figures for the inauguration.\n\nWith former Republican congressman Mike Pompeo, a West Point graduate, now confirmed as CIA director and the nomination of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state moving forward, Mattis may soon have other grown-ups governing, too. But Tillerson has no Washington experience and won’t be immediately up to speed.\n\nRelated: 9 Things to Know About Trump's Pick for CIA Director, Mike Pompeo\n\nPompeo, on the other hand, was a member of the House Intelligence Committee and should be more immediately ready to stand with Mattis, who in his memo called the military and the Intelligence Community “the sentinels and guardians of our nation.”\n\nAt least someone will be watching America’s back while Trump and his troupe are careening toward the formation of a government."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/25/Hidden-Messages-Behind-Trump-s-Evolving-Signature",
    "text": "Whether you believe in handwriting analysis or not, it’s fun to hear how graphologists interpret the signatures of famous people. In September 2015, Politico Magazine asked Michelle Dresbold, who analyzes handwriting for the U.S. Secret Service, to evaluate the signatures the presidential candidates. Here’s what she said about then candidate Donald Trump:\n\nDonald Trump’s signature has absolutely no curves, only angles. Curves in handwriting show softness, nurturing and a maternal nature. Angles show a writer who is feeling angry, determined, fearful, competitive or challenged. When a script is completely devoid of curves, the writer lacks empathy and craves power, prestige and admiration. Besides the bigheadedness that shows in this script, there is something else that is rather over-sized—the “p” in “Trump.” This large phallic symbol shouts, “Me … big hunk of man.”\n\nIf Dresbold’s analysis is even mildly correct, Trump has made a huge leap toward power since the election. Note, in particular, that the ‘p’ is now the largest element in the signature. The dramatic difference between the two signatures over the last 16 months is the difference between an uncertain candidate and a triumphant sitting president.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther analysts have examined the signature. Tracey Trussell of the British Institute of Graphologists explains in the The Independent that the large writing, upright slant and long tall letters indicate a whole host of characteristics about Mr. Trump. Ms. Trussell says: “His signature transmits wild ambition, dynamism, bravery and fearlessness ... He's hungry for power and has both determination and stubbornness in spades.” She claims that Mr. Trump's style indicates that, despite his forceful nature, he is protective too, especially when it comes to his family.\n\nCNN quotes graphologist Kathi McKnight on Trump’s signature: \"Needle-sharp points and wedges throughout reveal acute analytical and lightning speed quick thinking. No softness is found anywhere in his handwriting.”\n\nAt Quartz, handwriting expert Marc J. Seifer, who observed the ceremonial signing, noted how deliberate Trump’s penmanship was. He sees Trump’s strokes as a mirror of his leadership style. “I also noticed that the last letter ‘d’ is made by moving to the left instead of the right, which reflects his nature, which goes against the grain,” he notes. “The use of all angles relates to his aggressive nature and tendency to see things black or white, one way or the other, with little room for compromise.”"

    "text": "President Trump, who has promised to utterly reshape the United States’ economic relationship with the rest of the world, has named the man who will be the public face of that change for many of the country’s top partners and allies.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported early Tuesday that Kenneth I. Juster, a managing partner with the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, has been named deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs. He will fill a policymaking position with responsibilities that extend across multiple federal departments and agencies, including the departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nJuster will also be in charge of managing the White House’s relationship with key international bodies, including the Group of Seven, made up of the largest industrialized economies, and the G20, made up of the 20 largest economies in the world. That by itself will be a challenging role given Trump’s intention to radically rewrite trade policy.\n\nFurther, Juster will have to navigate a Trump administration in which some traditional roles have been scrambled, particularly when it comes to issues of international trade.\n\nJuster brings considerable experience to the role. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he has served multiple stints in the federal government, including several years as deputy and senior adviser to Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger in the final years of the George H. W. Bush administration. He returned to government service in 2001, serving in the first term of the George W. Bush administration as an undersecretary of Commerce in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Security, which overseas export control and trade-related treaty compliance, among other things.\n\nAfter leaving the government, he worked as a senior executive at the software firm Salesforce until joining Warburg Pincus in 2010.\n\nRelated: Democrats Block Trump at Their Peril as Labor Climbs Aboard Trump Train\n\nJuster will enter a White House that from an international trade perspective looks different from those he may have been familiar with in the past. President Trump has promised to tear up multilateral trade deals, both long-standing agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement and others that have not even been ratified, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he effectively killed shortly after taking office.\n\nThe administration has said that the president believes the U.S. ought to negotiate trade deals country by country, because he believes that maximizes the leverage the White House has to extract the best possible terms for the country.\n\nIn addition, Trump has set up a structure in the White House in which the traditional duties of the USTR have been thinned out somewhat. For example, incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected to play a larger-than-normal role in setting trade policy.\n\nTrump has also created an entirely new entity in the West Wing, the National Trade Council, and has named University of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro to run it. When the creation of the council was announced, transition team members suggested it would occupy status similar to the National Security Council in Trump’s hierarchy of advisors.\n\nRelated: Trump v. Truth: How Will the New Administration Make Policy?\n\nOfficials said that the mission of the National Trade Council would be to work “collaboratively and synergistically with the National Security Council, the National Economic Council, and the Domestic Policy Council to fulfill the President’s vision of peace and prosperity through military and economic strength” and to “think strategically about the health of America’s defense industrial base and the role of trade and manufacturing in national security.”\n\nIf Juster finds himself parachuting into uncertainty, it won’t be the first time. In addition to his work in the private sector, he has been very active working on economic development and civil society promotion in the developing world and in post-communist Eastern Europe.\n\nDavid Kramer, president of Freedom House, said Juster “has great personal integrity and character, a wealth of knowledge ... and a proven track record of leadership.”"

    "text": "Predictions are a treacherous business, especially when they concern Donald J. Trump. Nevertheless, I'm going to stick my neck out: Within four years, President Trump will tank the economy.\n\nFirst off, a few things that I don't think will matter, since a lot of other commentators obsess over them: Trump's erratic behavior isn't going to panic the stock market, and his changes to global trade arrangements will be modest, perhaps even positive.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\nWorries to the contrary all make a similar mistake: They assume the wealthy and their willingness to invest is the central driver of economic action. Instead what matters is the activity of ordinary people: their trades, their purchases, their daily work, their small risks, their ongoing efforts to make life for their families a bit better. Without all that, there are no financial assets for investors to park their money in.\n\nThis brings us to Trump and the Congressional GOP.\n\nIt's unlikely their policies will create a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. They could if they dismantled Dodd-Frank's financial regulations, but the Republicans' majority in the Senate isn't anywhere near big enough to break a filibuster. To paraphrase Tolstoy, all happy economies are the same; all unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.\n\nInstead, Trump and the Republicans will gut the U.S. budget, and thus the economy, via reconciliation, a Senate procedural move that allows lawmakers to pass bills with simple majorities if they're solely concerned with budgetary questions. They'll use this tool to suck hundreds of billions of dollars out of ordinary economic activity every year, depriving Americans of spending money, shrinking business revenue, lowering investment, and cutting tens of thousands of government jobs. This will lead to even less macro-economic spending, thus sending the economy into a tailspin.\n\nRelated: As the US Turns Inward, China Picks Up the Mantle of Free Trade\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has his budget ready to go, which would take an axe to Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance, and the rest of the safety net. Then there's another budget-slashing proposal from the arch-conservative Heritage Foundation, which is apparently serving as a basis for Trump's plans as well. As The Hill just reported, these cuts would extend far beyond the safety net, and decimate most of the government's investments in civil society.\n\nA quick sampling: Programs at the Department of Justice that deal with civil rights and violence against women will be reduced or eliminated; energy programs to promote nuclear physics, green energy, efficiency, and more will be cut; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be privatized; the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities would be wiped out entirely. Tens of billions will be cut from energy subsidies, transit, water conservation, and more.\n\nEvery safety net program is extra money in people's pockets to spend in their communities, sustaining business and the jobs they create. Every government project invested in, every staff position created, is one more person with a paycheck, who can then go out and spend, producing ripples through the private sector, and leading to more investment and more hiring. Trumps' cuts will bleed hundreds of billions of dollars out of those virtuous cycles every year.\n\nTo get a sense of the sheer scale of the change, the total reductions in the Heritage blueprint come to $10.5 trillion over the next decade. That's roughly one quarter of all federal spending. That's truly gargantuan.\n\nNow, some of the cuts in Heritage's budget are to Medicare and Social Security, which Trump is staying away from so far. Ultimately, the GOP may even balk at repealing ObamaCare's subsidies. All of which would bring that $10.5 trillion down to $7.5 trillion or $6.5 trillion. Which is still a gargantuan sum.\n\nOn top of that, Trump's appointments to the Federal Reserve will probably slow the economy further. During his campaign, the president was all over the place on monetary policy. But he eventually settled on the standard GOP line: Tight money and higher interest rates. This would be like tying weights to the economy's back after Trump's budgets have already bled it by a thousand cuts.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. the Dollar: Why Investors Are Right to Be Nervous\n\nOne could argue that Trump's tax cuts will offset all this. They could add up to $6 trillion themselves to the debt over 10 years, though right now no one really knows what Trump is planning. But the vast bulk of those cuts would not put money back in the pockets of ordinary workers and consumers. They would put money back in the pockets of wealthy investors. Even Trump's much-ballyhooed infrastructure plan is reportedly going to be graft for big business via corporate tax cuts. All in all, spending reductions will probably far outweigh tax cuts, at least in terms of the economic activity that drives most economic growth.\n\nTo get a sense of the sheer scale of the change, the total reductions in the Heritage blueprint come to $10.5 trillion over the next decade.

Trump could defy his party and resist more than just the cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Or he could switch back to his old love for low interest rates. Or the Republicans themselves could just wimp out in the face of popular backlash. All of that seems unlikely, though.\n\nMy analysis might even be too optimistic. Trump is a consummate salesman but an empty vessel when it comes to policy. So he could just wind up caving to the congressional GOP's demands, and give the country the \"full Heritage.\"\n\nSo, best-case scenario: The already-lackluster economic recovery slows even further to a bare crawl. Worst-case scenario: The policies of President Trump and the Republicans pitch us into recession sometime in the next four years.\n\nYou heard it here first.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Week.

By tapping a deep strain of political disaffection with the functioning of democracy, Mr. Trump became a beneficiary of the low esteem in which US voters hold their government, elected representatives, and political parties, but he was not responsible for a problem that has had a long gestation.”\n\nThe US, it adds, had been “teetering on the brink” of falling out of the ranks of full democracies, and would have done so in this year’s report even if there had been no presidential election at all.\n\nThe EIU democracy rankings are based on a ten-point scale, with a score based on combined rating of Electoral process and pluralism, the functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an ‘America First’ Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nA cumulative score below 8.0 drops a country out of the “full democracy” ranks and into those of “flawed democracies,” where the US now keeps company with countries that include Italy, Botswana, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.\n\nDragging the country’s score down was its rating in the “functioning of government” (7.14) and “political participation” (7.22) categories.\n\nThe EIU cites multiple “long-standing reasons” for the decline in the country’s government function ranking, including “ideological entrenchment of congressional representatives” leading to “bitter partisanship.”\n\n“The upshot is a stronger emphasis on ideological purity and less appetite for compromise, which reinforces a lack of confidence in Congress among voters. Nevertheless, respect for the constitution and democratic values are deeply entrenched as a result of centuries of democratic practice. For urgent and crucial decisions majorities can normally be obtained, but solutions to long-term problems often fall victim to deadlock.”\n\nRelated: No, Trump Didn’t Just Make the Day He Took Office a National Holiday\n\nThe EIU report, being descriptive rather than prescriptive, doesn’t offer the country a roadmap back to full democracy status. However, it offers some hope that economic growth could help ameliorate some of the country’s problems.\n\n“If income inequality has exacerbated American trust in government and public institutions, continued economic progress should start to reverse this trend in the coming years. The unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, average hourly wage growth is at its highest level since the financial crisis, and income inequality should gradually narrow if the economic recovery continues. If these trends are maintained, the US could improve in our 2017 rankings.”"

    "text": "In November 2016, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a bombshell: After spending 11 years and $3.1 billion, the automated immigration processing system designed to prevent terrorists from entering the United States simply didn’t work.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ new Electronic Immigration System, ELIS, was supposed to speed up the cumbersome, complex system for processing immigrants seeking legal status. Instead, it did the opposite because of a spate of technical problems and poorly conceived specifications. Operational deficiencies ranging from frequent power outages to the inability of ELIS to access or add information to existing digital platforms added hours of human labor. Naturalization cases frequently got stuck in the ELIS workflow and applicant interviews were often mistakenly canceled.\n\nRelated: Are Mass Deportations Coming in the US? Paul Ryan Says No\n\nWorst of all: ELIS is so highly flawed that it could grant citizenship to people who “pose national security threats.” Not only could ineligible immigrants be approved, you might not know if they had a criminal record or ties to terrorism because of the glitches in the system. And here’s the kicker: ELIS had erroneously issued nearly 20,000 green cards, granting legal status to live and work in the US to people who were almost certainly improperly vetted.\n\n“Since its deployment on April 13, 2016, ELIS has impaired the ability of USCIS Immigration Services Officers and field personnel to conduct naturalization processing,” said John Roth, the inspector general. Roth thought he had received assurances from USCIS that it would mothball the pricey computer system until the multitude of problems had been ironed out.\n\nBut late last week, Roth was forced to issue a cease and desist order to Leon Rodriquez, Director of USCIS, after learning that the agency intended to resume operation of ELIS before all the kinks were worked out.\n\nRelated: Trump Stands Alone Calling for Mass Deportation of Illegal Immigrants\n\nThe Homeland Security Inspector was no doubt spitting bullets by this time, since he had issued multiple warnings over many months to Rodriguez who had not only ignored Roth’s recommendation but also denied the problem, according to a report in NextGov.\n\nRoth said that during an ongoing follow-up investigation by his staff in the USCIS headquarters and field operations he had discovered “alarming security concerns regarding inadequate applicant background checks, as well as significant problems in using ELIS to process naturalization benefits for immigrants.”\n\nHomeland Security is not the only federal agency to spend taxpayer money freely with little to show for it. In 2015, the Brookings Institution assessed government investment in IT projects and concluded, “U.S. government spent 75.6 billion dollars on IT projects in 2014. That is enough to save the world and still have 600 million dollars to spare.” A study by the Standish Group revealed that only 6.4 percent of federal IT projects costing $10 million or more were successful.\n\nAt a time when the debate over immigration and terrorism has reached a fevered pitch, the debacle over a vital new computer system for vetting immigrants seeking to enter the country is remarkable.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Deport Millions of Illegal Immigrants with Criminal Records\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the election on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigrants and deny entry to the U.S. by Muslims or people from countries experiencing rampant terrorist violence. Today, Trump signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, and he has promised to beef up border patrols and immigration services. Like President Obama before him, Trump also plans to deport millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records. But Trump is going further by proposing that immigrants from countries that are experiencing terrorism be barred from the U.S.\n\nTrump might want to look as well at a failing immigration computer system that the Homeland Security inspector general says poses a threat to national security. The USCIS press office declined to comment for this story.\n\nELIS dates back nearly a decade as a system originally designed and budgeted to cost $536 million. Those numbers went out the window long ago as costs are now projected to be 480 percent higher. Promises of state of the art vetting and administrative efficiencies never materialized, while the long-delayed website won’t be fully operational for another two years or more, if ever.\n\n(This article was updated on January 26, 2017)"

    "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday morning declared himself an “environmentalist” in public remarks before meeting with automobile manufacturers, but as the day wore on, he and his new administration seemed intent on realizing the worst fears of the broader conservation movement.\n\nIn the same breath in which he characterized himself as an environmentalist, Trump said that he believes that the movement is “out of control” and promised a “very big push” to have more cars built in the United States. He also promised for the second day in a row to roll back regulations that he said are stifling the productivity of U.S. businesses. On Monday, he told a different group of business leaders that he believes he could do away with 75 percent of federal regulations or more.\n\nRelated: Trump v. Truth: How Will the New Administration Make Policy?\n\nJust a few hours after the meeting with automakers, Trump signed executive orders that, according to the White House, direct federal agencies to clear the way for construction of two controversial oil pipelines, Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Both are adamantly opposed by environmental groups that say they promote the use of highly-polluting fuels and pose the danger of leaks and explosions.\n\nThe Obama administration had essentially killed the Keystone project, and Trump’s plan invites Trans Canada, its builder, to re-submit its application. The Dakota Access Pipeline, subject of intense protests this fall and winter, was indefinitely delayed by the Obama administration before Trump was sworn in last Friday.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough to send environmental activists to the barricades, multiple federal agencies dealing with the environment, agriculture and public health received instructions from Trump administration officials to cease all communications with the public -- and in some cases even with members of Congress.\n\nSpeaking from the podium at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that what many began referring to as a “gag order” was simply an effort by the Trump administration to assure that the messages coming out of various government agencies were in line with the new president’s policies.\n\nRelated: How the Senate Could Stop Trump's Drive to Slash Federal Spending\n\nHowever, the fact that scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, parts of the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Health and Human Services were instructed to cease all public communication on Tuesday -- a move that appeared to include the publication of new data to the agencies’ websites -- played right into existing fears among many in the scientific community.\n\nOf particular concern is what the new administration’s policies will be with regard to climate science. Trump’s decision to appoint Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the EPA made it seem clear to many that those policies will not track with the preferences of environmental groups. Pruitt spent much of his time as attorney general filing lawsuits against the EPA, claiming that the agency’s regulations on the oil and gas industry are unconstitutional.\n\nIn the months between Trump’s unexpected election victory and his swearing in last Friday, environmental groups and scientific organizations had begun an unofficial effort to gather and safeguard research data and other government information related to the subject of global warming and climate change. The fear among many was that the Trump administration would reduce the focus on climate science within the federal government and that it might also make federally collected data that outside academics and researchers rely on unavailable.\n\nToday’s announcements came just as news outlets began widely reporting on a National Institutes of Health conference on the public health threats posed by global warming that was cancelled, apparently out of concern that the new administration would not approve of it."

    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has invited President Trump to address a joint session of Congress on February 28. This is a genius move. If Democrats boycott the gathering, as some surely will, they will commit political suicide.\n\nMore positively, maybe Trump can convince members of both parties to do what is right for the country: enact tax reforms that benefit small and large businesses, reduce the regulations that inhibit investment, and push healthcare reform that will actually give middle-class families access to medical care.\n\nRelated: The Smart Money Is Betting Against Full Obamacare Repeal\n\nRyan announced the invitation in his weekly press conference, explaining, “This will be an opportunity for the people and their representatives to hear directly from our new president about his vision and our shared agenda.” In other words, unfiltered through the mainstream media. A Ryan spokesman earlier said, “The Speaker and President Trump are eager to continue moving forward on their shared agenda to jumpstart the economy and get the country back on track.”\n\nWill Democrats play ball? Maybe not. Democrats have so far opposed every single proposal from Trump, demeaned and criticized nearly every cabinet nominee, sat out the inauguration in large numbers and generally conducted themselves as sore losers. If they persist, they will further alienate the group that elected Donald Trump – middle-class Americans who have traditionally supported Democrats -- and relinquish any hope of rebuilding their decimated party.\n\nThe Trump agenda is beginning to roll forward, picking up followers like a snowball picks up snow. In particular, labor unions and American workers are cheering some of the very first measures signed by the president – walking away from the TPP and green-lighting the Keystone Pipeline. On Monday, shortly after announcing the official termination of the multi-nation trade agreement, the president met with labor leaders who applauded his move. Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa said in a written statement, “With this decision, the president has taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies that have cost working Americans millions of good-paying jobs.”\n\nRelated: How Donald Trump Is Winning His War on Hollywood\n\nSean McGarvey, president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, said after the confab (most of which was private), “He intends to do the work on the issues he discussed on the campaign trail…It was by far the best meeting I’ve had in Washington.”\n\nThis new-found harmony between the GOP and Big Labor should have Democrats shivering in their Gucci’s. The party is in the midst of the sort of intensive self-analysis that accompanies a colossal defeat. They continue to pin Hillary Clinton’s loss on Vladimir Putin and James Comey, ignoring the real reason for their defeat: the defection of their core constituency, blue collar workers.\n\nMoreover, anxious Democrats are looking in the wrong places for salvation. There are some who see in last Saturday’s large and news-grabbing women’s march the seeds of renewal. They liken the outpouring of millions of exuberant demonstrators to the stirrings of the Tea Party in the early days of the Obama administration. They are wrong. The activists who railed against rising deficits and debts, kicked into action by Rick Santelli’s famous on-air rant and call for a “Tea Party,” did indeed rouse Republicans from the depths of despair and help put the party back on the map. But the call to action was a national call, appealing to all Americans who worried about the country’s soaring debts and unsustainable spending.\n\nRelated: Here’s How Inflation Could Suck the Wind Out of Trump’s Economy\n\nBy contrast, the marchers in Washington and other cities around the world had no unifying theme. It was not pro-women; after all, pro-life women’s groups were excluded. It was a crew of often vulgar anti-Trump sloganeers who were championing the kind of identity politics that Democrats have embraced to their peril for the past eight years. This was the weekend of a presidential inauguration; for most Americans a time of national pride. There was no such sentiment offered up by the women in the streets.\n\nColumnist David Brooks points out that the marchers “could have offered a red, white and blue alternative patriotism, a modern, forward-looking patriotism based on pluralism, dynamism, growth, racial and gender equality and global engagement. Instead, the protests offered the pink hats, an anti-Trump movement built, oddly, around Planned Parenthood, and lots of signs with the word “pussy” in them.”\n\nNot quite the cohesive message that will start a political movement, which is the only kind that matters.\n\nThe same issues arise as Democrats consider who will lead their party out of the darkness. There are now three African-Americans, two whites and one Hispanic vying for the position. At a recent candidates’ forum, Sally Boynton Brown, who is white, garnered attention by saying that if successful, her job will be to “shut other white people down”; she lambasted fellow Democrats for not talking enough about Black Lives Matter and said if selected, she would make sure that “[white people] get that they have privilege.” Is that really the burning issue for Democrats today? Or for the country?\n\nRelated: Why Trump Can’t Turn Back the Clock on Clean Energy Transition\n\nPresident Obama left office with high approval ratings even though he arguably never put the country’s overriding concern – job creation – at the top of his agenda. Instead, Obama catered largely to environmental and minority issues, leaving behind a nation more divided that when he took office. Hillary Clinton lost in part because she mistook Obama’s personal popularity for approval of his policies.\n\nIn 2018, there are 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in states that Trump won; five in states that Trump won decisively. Some, like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, have already started to back Trump’s policies. Others may follow suit, undermining the current brick wall of Democrat opposition to Donald Trump. If they don’t climb aboard the Trump train, the GOP could well enter 2019 with a filibuster-proof majority.\n\nDemocrats have a chance to work with President Trump to boost the economy and raise incomes. So far, newly elected Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised no cooperation and pledged no backing down. He could play the part of Bill Clinton’s Newt Gingrich or Ronald Reagan’s Tip O’Neil, the loyal opposition helping to pass popular legislation and at the same time build up his party. If he does not, Democrats will be in the wilderness for some time to come."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Tom-Price-Open-Major-Change-How-Medicaid-Works",
    "text": "Facing new claims that he has not been forthright about his investments in health care stocks while working on legislation that could affect their value, Georgia Rep. Tom Price appeared before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday in advance of its vote to approve his nomination to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. He also conceded that an administration proposal to turn Medicaid into a “block grant” program could end its status as an entitlement program.\n\nPrice had previously been bludgeoned by Democrats over his investments, who have suggested that his behavior, which included sponsoring legislation that would benefit a company whose stock he owned, was unethical. On Monday, a Finance Committee staff report revealed that Price had also been forced to address inconsistencies in his financial disclosures and had failed to disclose that he had once been the subject of an investigation by the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nRelated: There’s Less to Trump’s Obamacare Executive Order Than Some Suggest\n\nThe senior Democrat on the Panel, Ron Wyden of Oregon, forcefully reiterated a string of investment decisions and reporting failures, and demanded of Price “Yes or no? Doesn’t this show bad judgement?”\n\n“Well, if what you said was true, it might,” Price replied, setting off a back and forth that was interrupted by Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) who spent much of the hearing acting as Price’s defender.\n\nThe nominee later pressed back against claims that he had behaved unethically, saying, “The reality is that everything I did was ethical, above board, legal, and transparent. The reason that you know about these things is because we have made that information available in real time as required by the House Ethics Committee.”\n\nWhile the questions about his stock trades have caused some discomfort for Price, there doesn’t seem to be much wavering about his nomination in the ranks of Senate Republicans, who would be able to confirm him with a simple majority vote.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nWyden also asked Price to address the executive order issued by President Trump on the day of his inauguration that directed all government agencies to “exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”\n\nThe order left many wondering if the new president’s plan was to begin disassembling the Affordable Care Act even before Congress passed a repeal bill.\n\nWyden, saying that rolling back the law without a replacement would “destroy the market on which millions of working families buy health coverage,” asked Price if he would commit to not acting on the order until a replacement for the ACA had been put in place.\n\nPrice declined to do so, saying that what he would commit to “is to keep patients at the center of health care. And what that means to me is making sure every single American has access to affordable health coverage that provides the highest quality health care that the world can provide.”\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nPrice also dodged Wyden’s attempt to get him to promise that nobody would be “worse off” under whatever replacement plan the administration puts forward. However, in later questioning, he went on to say that no one will lose coverage as a result and to agree to the promise that no one would be “worse off.”\n\nIt’s important to note, when Price refers to “affordable health coverage,” that the definition of “insurance coverage” is all important in this discussion. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that some of the more bare-bones plans that opponents of Obamacare would like to see as offered as legitimate options after repeal would have such scant benefits that the agency would not consider them health insurance coverage at all.\n\nIn an exchange with New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, Price appeared to be at least open to ending the status of Medicaid as an entitlement. Under the current structure of the program, anybody who meets the qualifications for the program is entitled -- has a right -- to receive care under it.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has signaled its intention to turn the program into a block grant, under which each state would be given a fixed sum for the program, creating the possibility that coverage might not be available to all qualified applicants.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Will Test the Definition of ‘Insurance’\n\nPrice said he agreed with Menendez that under a block grant, there would not necessarily be a right to coverage under Medicaid. “I think it would be determined by how it was set up, if that was in fact what Congress did. Again, the role of the Department of Health and Human Services is to administer the laws that you pass, not to make the law.”\n\nMenendez urged the nominee not to pretend that, as HHS secretary, he won’t have enormous influence on policy and how it is implemented."

    "text": "President Donald Trump’s choice to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) declared on Tuesday that the government must address the nearly $20 trillion national debt in the short term by making “fundamental changes” in the way Washington spends and taxes.\n\nDuring a confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) foreshadowed the Trump administration’s drive to eliminate waste, fraud, and duplication of effort in government and scale back the size of the federal workforce. He made this pledge even while Trump presses for new spending on defense and infrastructure and major tax cuts that analysts warn would further drive up the debt.\n\nRelated: How the Senate Could Stop Trump's Drive to Slash Federal Spending\n\n“I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later,” Mulvaney, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a sharp critic of government spending, said in his opening remarks. “I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our government’s long-term fiscal path – which is unsustainable.”\n\nMulvaney also testified that he would support raising the retirement age in order to save Medicare and Social Security for future generations.\n\nMulvaney’s hearing coincided with the release of the Congressional Budget Office’s revised ten-year budget and economic outlook showing the government still on track for historic surges in the federal debt, even while the fiscal 2017 deficit picture has brightened somewhat since last August.\n\nCBO’s latest deficit projection for fiscal 2017 is $559 billion, or $35 billion less than the previous estimate -- but still $28 billion more than the government’s revenue shortfall in fiscal 2016.\n\nLast year was the first time the budget deficit rose since 2009 – an ominous signal to lawmakers and policy experts that the government was once again on the road to massive $1 trillion a year deficits that were common during the worst of the Great Recession.\n\nAs annual revenue deficits pile up in the coming years, publicly held debt will rise from 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2017 to 89 percent of the overall economy by 2027. In dollar terms, publicly held debt will increase from $14.8 trillion at the end of this year to $24.9 trillion by 2027, according to CBO’s baseline analysis.\n\nRelated: CBO Says Deficit on the Rise for the First Time Since 2009\n\nPublicly held debt is the sum total of the government’s borrowing to meet its obligations in a timely fashion, while the gross national debt – now closing in on $20 trillion – includes both the publicly held debt and internal government borrowing by agencies and trust funds like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n“Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion,” Mulvaney said today. “That number is so large as to defy description.”\n\nWhile the national debt draws most of the attention and is viewed as the ultimate symbol of government waste and spending excesses, the CBO warns that the steadily mounting publicly held debt poses long-term threats to the economy and the government’s ability to react to crises or unexpected expenses.\n\nAnnual deficits or revenue shortfalls are largely driven by mounting defense and domestic spending programs and entitlements for the elderly and low-income Americans. According to CBO’s latest projections, budget deficits will remain below three percent of GDP through 2019, but then begin to climb dramatically – driven by spending on Social Security, Medicare for seniors and net interest costs on the debt.\n\nRelated: Big Deficits Loom as Candidates Pile on Spending and Tax Cuts\n\nBy 2027, the deficit will reach five percent of GDP, or $1.4 trillion, absent any change in government policies to address the long-term deficit.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, issued a statement describing the latest CBO report as a “dangerous debt picture for the United States.”\n\nMacGuineas and other deficit hawks have warned that Trump’s agenda of major spending hikes combined with hefty tax cuts for individuals and corporations will greatly add to the country’s long-term debt woes. Her group has estimated that Trump’s plans, when taken together, would increase the debt by $5.3 trillion over the coming decade. Her group did not score Trump’s impact “dynamically,” meaning Trump’s plans to reduce government spending are not accounted for in this estimate.\n\nTrump and his economic team, including Mulvaney, argue that the administration’s spending and fiscal policies, including the tax cut, will turbocharge the economy and more than offset any revenue shortfalls in the long term. “Fixing the economy doesn’t mean just taking a green eyeshade approach to the Budget,” Mulvaney said today. “Our government isn’t just about numbers. A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable.”\n\nBut MacGuineas said, “Policymakers should not go into debt denial with hopes that unrealistic growth and rosy projections will save the day. Ignoring these fiscal facts is like ignoring a coming storm. Our nation will be drowning under red ink if policymakers do not reverse course now.”\n\nBeyond budget and deficit matters, Mulvaney was grilled today by Democrats for failing to pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a babysitter who worked for the family for four years.\n\nMulvaney said that he and his wife “made a mistake” because they didn’t consider the babysitter – who helped in caring for their triplets -- a household employee. He said he didn’t realize that he should have paid taxes on her until he was preparing for the nominating process. Since then, he has paid the taxes."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Why-We-ll-Never-Know-What-We-Need-About-Trump-s-Most-Important-Adviser-Michael-Flynn",
    "text": "On paper, Michael Flynn, the ex-Army general and campaign cheerleader chosen by Donald Trump to be his National Security Adviser, has top-notch credentials.\n\nA career military officer, Flynn came up through the ranks the hard way: He began not with the pedigree of a West Point cadet but as a graduate of the ROTC program at the University of Rhode Island.\n\nRelated: Out Like Flynn: Why Trump Must Dump the ‘Fake News’ General\n\nAs chief of intelligence for Gen. Stanley McChrystal when he was running the war in Afghanistan, Flynn is said to have distinguished himself with an uncanny ability to unravel terrorist networks and has been called “one of the most respected military intelligence officers of his generation” by The Washington Post. Such a record no doubt contributed to his selection by former President Obama to head the Defense Intelligence Agency, one of the military’s major spy services.\n\nThe role of National Security Adviser has been in place since the beginning of the Cold War, and Flynn is by no means the first ex-officer to hold the critical post; former Lt. General Brent Scowcroft and former four-star Gen. and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell are among those who preceded him.\n\nIn fact, National Security Advisers have had a mixed-bag of qualifications, including careers as diplomats and academics. Notable examples are McGeorge Bundy, Walt Rostow, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, all of whom became involved in disastrous military actions overseas.\n\nHowever, perhaps no recent appointment to this role has been as controversial as Flynn’s, and it raises a question that begs to be answered, especially in light of the threats America faces and the fact that Trump, like the three presidents who came before him, has zero experience in foreign affairs: Why is one of the jobs most important to the safety of the nation not subject to Senate oversight?\n\nRelated: Day of the Generals: Trump’s Tilt Toward the Military\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report last month, Flynn was investigated in 2010 when he was intelligence chief in Afghanistan for inappropriately sharing secrets with allies. But the more disturbing questions center on his activities and behavior after being ousted as head of the DIA, reportedly following clashes with other powerful spooks within the Obama administration.\n\nThe consulting firm he started, Flynn Intel Group, was a paid lobbyist for a Turkish businessman with ties to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, according to The New York Times. And in an op-ed for The Hill on Nov. 8, Flynn identified the Pennsylvania-based mullah Fethullah Gülen, a fierce opponent of the Erdoğan regime, as a radical Islamist whose “vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network.”\n\nGiven Flynn’s intel bona fides, those charges are not to be taken lightly. But it is the general’s hyperbolic tone, evident at Trump rallies where he led chants of “lock her up” directed at Hillary Clinton, that seems alarming in an adviser charged with giving clear-headed opinions to a commander-in-chief who isn’t known for keeping a cool head.\n\nBeyond that, Flynn was a purveyor of fake news during Trump’s campaign and has recent history with Russia that is troubling: In 2015, he was a paid speaker for RT (formerly Russia Today) and attended an anniversary gala for the Kremlin-backed TV news network in Moscow, where he was seated at the right hand of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Flynn Is Manipulating Trump on Russia. Where’s His Pink Slip?\n\nOn Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Flynn was being investigated by U.S. counterintelligence for calls to Russian officials around the time Obama was imposing sanctions on Moscow for hacking and interfering in the American election (including by using RT to disseminate anti-Clinton stories). However, on Monday night a Post story said the FBI had reviewed intercepted communications between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S. and found “no evidence of wrongdoing.” How all that shakes out remains to be seen.\n\nBut if the Flynn appointment has had one beneficial effect, it has been to put a spotlight on the job he now holds. The Senate must confirm the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security and the Director of the CIA. It even gets to grill the nominee for Commerce Secretary. So why not the National Security Adviser? Because that job has never has required advice and consent? Because it doesn’t control a major budget?\n\nGary Samore, executive director for research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, offers another reason why Flynn or anyone else appointed to his position should not have to sit for a Senate grilling.\n\n\"In my experience, the Senate confirmation process is badly broken, with many lengthy delays or senators seeking to extract concessions in exchange for voting for nominees,\" said Samore, who served for four years as President Obama’s White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction. \"So I would not favor requiring Senate confirmation for the National Security Adviser.\"\n\nYou could also argue that there are numerous other advisers who have the president’s ear and won’t be vetted, some of whom may be highly influential. But given the checkered, life-and-death advice National Security Advisers have delivered in the past and given the clear-and-present dangers, shouldn't the nation have the right, through its elected representatives, to question the counselor whose views may directly affect its safety?\n\nWill Flynn be the honest broker that the role demands? That’s hard to know if we don’t get to ask him.\n\nThis article was updated at 6:14 p.m. on Jan. 24."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Trump-v-Truth-How-Will-New-Administration-Make-Policy",
    "text": "The truthfulness of President Donald Trump and those surrounding him in the White House is and will continue to be a subject of intense media interest over the coming years. From Saturday’s falsehood-littered first media briefing to a meeting Monday night in which Trump insisted to lawmakers -- against all evidence -- that he had only lost the popular vote because millions of fraudulent votes were cast, the new administration has shown that it cares little about the literal truth of the information it gives the American public.\n\nThe mainstream media reaction has been palpably angry. In a remarkable series of tweets last night, The New York Times called out Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for a collection of untruths. On its front page Tuesday, the paper addressed the president’s claim about voter fraud with a headline that flatly said he was lying: “Meeting with Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie.”\n\nRelated: How the Senate Could Stop Trump's Drive to Slash Federal Spending\n\nSo far, most of the new administration’s mendacity has been focused on things that appear to embarrass Trump. That includes things like his popular vote loss to Hillary Clinton or the acres of empty space on the National Mall during his inauguration and the countless empty seats along the route of the parade that followed.\n\nBut as the inauguration fades into the past, what will be really instructive about the future direction of the Trump administration is how it deals with a different kind of fact -- the ones that, unlike crowd size and whether the skies miraculously cleared as soon as Trump began his inaugural address, actually have an impact on the lives of the American people.\n\nThat’s what one reporter at Spicer’s Monday afternoon press briefing appeared to be trying to get at when she asked him “What is the average national unemployment rate?”\n\nWhat many saw as a strange “gotcha” type query meant to catch Spicer out over a specific statistic, was really something else entirely. The official unemployment rate is currently 4.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but on the campaign trail, Trump frequently insisted that the official figures are fraudulent, insisting that the “real” rate could be as high as 42 percent.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Would Get Hit Hardest in a Trump Trade War\n\nThe issue the question was trying to probe is whether or not the Trump administration is going to accept the assessment of economists and other experts when they do their best to gather hard evidence about the state of the country.\n\nTo his credit, Spicer gave a rough description of how the BLS looks at unemployment in the country, pointing out that the official rate is one of several measures that the agency takes “so that economists can view them and...look at different landscapes on...how to make economic policy.”\n\nWithout trying to defend Trump’s indefensible 42 percent claim, Spicer promised that in the White House, “[the] economic team is going to look at a multitude of statistics and drive economic policies.” However, Spicer also made it plain that when his boss thinks about things like unemployment and job creation, he is less focused on hard numbers than he is on what is, effectively, anecdotal evidence.\n\nRelated: Why Trump's Family and Friends Are in for Heavy Financial Scrutiny\n\n“[W]hen he sees people that are hurting, that haven't had wages lifted up, that are unemployed, that can't save for their kids’ future, that are having a trouble with their healthcare costs, that's what he really cares about,” Spicer said. He added, “Those are the kinds of things the president, he's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether or not the American people are doing better as a whole.”\n\nSpicer defended Trump’s focus on relatively trivial actions, like pressuring the Carrier company to preserve between 800 and 1,000 jobs in Indiana -- not even a rounding error in national employment numbers -- rather than focusing on the bigger picture.\n\n“I think for too often in Washington, we get our heads wrapped around a number and a statistic,” Spicer continued. “And we look at and we forget the faces and the families and the businesses that are behind those numbers. And so, I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his event, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say, ‘Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.’”\n\nRelated: Trump Escalates His War With Media On First Full Day in Office\n\nThe thing is, the United States is a big country. Somebody’s always getting screwed somewhere. Somebody else is also getting really rich. But lots and lots of other people are muddling along somewhere in the middle. The chance that someone motivated enough by their own circumstances to come to a rally or to cut a politician a big check falls in that broad middle is probably a lot smaller than Trump and his team seem to want to admit.\n\nMany people close to Trump have complained that the person who has the most influence over his decision-making is, frequently, the last person he spoke to. What the nation and the media will need to be vigilant about in the years ahead is the danger of federal policy guided more by anecdote and feeling than by provable facts and well-researched figures."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/24/Trump-s-Nuclear-Defense-Plan-Another-Star-Wars-Budget-Buster",
    "text": "President Ronald Reagan cowed the Soviet Union and eventually brought its leaders to the bargaining table with the threat of a costly space-based nuclear missile system dubbed “Star Wars.” In March 1983, Reagan formally launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to develop and deploy an “impenetrable shield” to protect the U.S. from a Soviet missile attack.\n\nAlthough the U.S. ultimately spent more than $200 billion on a system that was never successfully developed and deployed, Reagan’s high-stakes defense gambit was credited by many for helping to hasten the end of the Cold War.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nNow newly inaugurated President Donald Trump may be trying to play a similar head game with North Korea’s 32-year-old leader Kim Jong Un. Kim recently declared that his rogue nation is in the final stages of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear tip capable of reaching parts of the United States.\n\n“It won’t happen!” Trump tweeted Jan. 2 in a dismissive rejoinder to Kim, which he followed up with a sharp criticism of China, North Korea’s patron, for not doing enough to restrain Kim’s soaring nuclear ambitions.\n\nLast Friday, shortly after Trump was sworn in as the 45th president, the new White House website declared in a policy statement that Trump will rebuild the U.S. military, boost its anti-missile capabilities and make it a top priority to defeat ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups. Now a new addition to Trump’s evolving defense posture, the website declared that the United States would develop a “state of the art missile defense system” to guard against attacks from North Korea, Iran, and other rogue states.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nThe announcement was bereft of details about the technical capabilities or the potential cost to taxpayers for a more sophisticated missile defense system than the land-based and seaborne systems currently deployed in California and Alaska and aboard Navy destroyers in the Pacific.\n\nIn addition to the missile shield, the Trump White House said a new military budget would be submitted to Congress outlining a plan to rebuild the military and increase cyber-warfare capabilities. “We will make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans to serve in this crucial area,” the statement declared.\n\nSince then, Trump and his aides have had little more to say about their proposed missile defense initiative, leaving defense policy experts to scratch their heads and speculate on what the new president has in mind. Some believe the U.S. doesn’t currently have a reliable system to deter North Korea’s emerging road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology from delivering nuclear warheads to the U.S. mainland, according to reports.\n\nRelated: Was Trump’s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nTrump once said that he would be happy to meet with Kim over hamburgers to try to reach an accommodation. Now that they are in power, Trump and his national security advisers are signaling they intend to take a much harder line with the unpredictable and highly dangerous North Korean dictator.\n\n“Arguably you could say the only anti-ballistic system we have that has some proven track record of success is the sort of mid-course phase intercept system that is deployed in Alaska and California, which is targeted at the North Korean threat,” Gordon Adams, a military analyst and historian, said in an interview Monday.\n\n“It’s basically a ground-launched missile system that is capable of taking out” North Korean missiles, and that has done reasonably well in tests. “I suspect it’s something that somebody else got to him on or got the White House’s agreement to put it on the website,” he added.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the declared mission of SDI, which became known as the National Missile Defense (NMD) program, changed dramatically. It went from a “skies the limit” scientific and engineering venture to a more modest goal of preventing the United States from being subjected to nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism by a rogue state like North Korea or Iran.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nUnlike the Star Wars program – which would likely cost $400 billion or more to replicate in today’s dollars – the NMD is not equipped to provide a robust shield against large attacks from a technically sophisticated adversary such as Russia. Moreover, it can’t handle enemy missiles with multiple warheads, according to Adams.\n\nThe NMD in time may become less useful as North Korea rushes ahead to develop a long-range nuclear missile program – one that would threaten Alaska and the West Coast, and that also poses a more immediate threat to neighboring South Korea and Japan. This may help to explain why Trump decided to sound the alarm and pledge a more up-to-date nuclear defense system last week.\n\nLast month, former Defense Secretary Ash Carter called Kim’s New Year’s day ballistic missile threat serious. Carter said U.S. forces would shoot down any missile aimed at it or an ally.\n\nAt present, the U.S. has roughly 40 interceptor missiles deployed at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and the Fort Greely Army launch site in Alaska, near Fairbanks. Their locations are optimized to defend against North Korea but with some capacity against possible future Mideast threats to the homeland, according to Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRelated: The Navy’s $7 Billion Stealth Destroyer Could Be ‘an Unmitigated Disaster'\n\n“The success of those interceptors in tests has been mixed, so their likely effectiveness is uncertain,” O’Hanlon said in an email. “They are already being upgraded, and Trump could simply implement that plan and declare a measure of success. Or he might add other types of technologies too--which are better than they used to be but . . . still not all that great or promising.\n\nFinally, Trump might hedge and improve the California/Alaska system while devoting more money for research and development for next-generation ideas without committing to any deployment yet. “I'd put my money on that last option based on the politics and the military/strategic dimensions of the situation,” O’Hanlon said."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/23/How-Senate-Could-Stop-Trumps-Drive-Slash-Federal-Spending",
    "text": "President Donald Trump wasted little time in trying to make good on his campaign pledge to slash government spending to make room for his initiatives, beginning with an executive order issued Monday morning freezing hiring in the federal workforce except in the military.\n\nBut Trump may be on a collision course with key Republicans on Capitol Hill over his drive to simultaneously cut fat from the government and reduce the deficit while promoting an ambitious agenda of new spending and tax cuts. Many of the programs Trump’s advisers are targeting have long enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nEven before the billionaire businessman was sworn in as the 45th president last Friday, Trump’s budgetary transition team reportedly began working with the conservative Heritage Foundation on the group’s wish list of major cuts in departments including Commerce, Energy, Justice and State, and the elimination of long-standing programs including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nHeritage recently unveiled a blueprint for achieving a balanced budget necessitating nearly $10 trillion in cuts and savings over the coming decade. Trump, apparently, is eagerly embracing the spending cut road map – especially deep cuts in non-defense domestic discretionary spending, according to The Hill.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said today that members of Trump “landing teams” met with department and agency officials before the inauguration and talked about ways to create greater efficiencies, eliminate duplication and maximize federal tax dollars.\n\n“It’s more a question instead of cutting, it’s about how do we spend and respect the Americans’ taxpayer dollars more going forward,” Spicer told reporters at the White House in discussing proposed spending cuts and the federal employee hiring freeze. “There’s been frankly some degree of lack of respect for taxpayers’ dollars in this town for a long time.”\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an ‘America First’ Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\n“And I think what the president is showing through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today, is that we’ve got to respect the American taxpayers,” Spicer added. “They are sending us a ton of money ... and to see money wasted in Washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work they do to pay their taxes.”\n\nSpicer didn’t highlight specific cuts the new administration has in mind – or confirm a goal of $10 trillion in cuts over the coming decade. Nor did he reconcile the administration’s drive to slash spending with Trump’s ballyhooed agenda that will substantially add to the deficit.\n\nThat includes $7 trillion or more in tax cuts, construction of a costly wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a massive buildup of defense and the U.S. nuclear arsenal, $1 trillion of highway, bridge and other infrastructure projects, and government subsidies for paid family leave, just to name a few.\n\nIf Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Trump’s choice to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), survives his Senate confirmation hearings beginning on Tuesday, the fiscal conservative may have a tough time reconciling some of the more glaring contradictions in Trump’s fiscal strategy while the national debt fast approaches $20 trillion.\n\nMulvaney will likely be grilled by Senate Budget Committee Democrats about his failure to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes for a household employee. But he may encounter even more difficult questions about how he will make the numbers in Trump’s budget add up.\n\nRelated: Trump Again Calls for Rebuilding US Infrastructure in Inaugural Address\n\n“There seems to be a hell of a lot on the table, and it’s not just in discretionary spending,” Jim Dyer, a former Republican chief of staff of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Monday. “I am stricken by the sheer volume of stuff that has been thrown out there.”\n\nDyer warns that the new Trump administration will soon experience fiscal circuit overload, as it tries to balance its major challenges of new tax and trade policies, infrastructure construction and rewriting of the nation’s health care laws with more small-bore concerns of conservative activists such as doing away with the National Endowment for the Humanities or the Legal Services Corporation, an agency that provides financial support for civil legal aid to low-income people.\n\nHe continued, “You only have so much political capital, and it seems to me that if I were at the White House I would be investing all of my political capital in taxes, trade, infrastructure and social safety net.”\n\nTrump and his advisers have been counting on an extended honeymoon with House and Senate Republican lawmakers, as they drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act early in the year and complete work on spending bills for fiscal 2017 that runs through next Sept. 30.\n\nRelated: GOP Governors Voice Alarm About Losing Expanded Medicaid\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pushed through a short-term extension of spending authority through late March to allow Trump and his budget advisers to have more input in funding the government through the remainder of the fiscal year. “I think the new, incoming government would like to have a say-so on how spending is allocated,\" Ryan said at the time.\n\nHowever, The Hill reported today that Trump may be headed for a tough fight with Republican lawmakers – especially veteran members of the Senate—over his plans for deep cuts in federal programs and agencies.\n\nPrograms like legal services, essential air service for remote parts of the country including Alaska, and the endowment for the humanities and for the arts all have strong backing on Capitol Hill in both parties and have weathered previous GOP efforts to gut them.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\n“I think that would be hard thing to do,” Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch (R-UT), said of any attempt to kill legal services, despite the projected savings of $400 million next year. “Even if you wanted to do that, you couldn’t get it through the Senate,” he said.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior Republican from Alaska, told the newspaper that she would lead a vigorous battle against any effort to cut funding for essential air service. “It would basically shut down rural Alaska,” she said. “If there is discussion about that, we as the Alaska delegation really have to ramp it up and let people know how critical it is.”"

    "text": "Social media went into freak-out mode on Monday after reports surfaced that President Donald Trump had declared the day of his inauguration a “National Day of Patriotic Devotion.” Outraged reaction on Twitter and other platforms accused the new president of channeling North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and other leaders obsessed with their own personality cults.\n\nRelated: The Best Signs from the Women's March on Washington\n\nThe stilted language in the federal register notice, set to be published January 24, contributed to the impression that the release might have been crafted in some office in Pyongyang.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2017, as National Day of Patriotic Devotion, in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country -- and to renew the duties of Government to the people.\n\nBut before we declare the end of the republic, it should probably be noted that this is not the introduction of a new national holiday marking Dear Leader Trump’s inauguration. It’s also not new or even all that interesting. In fact, presidential proclamations giving symbolic weight to inauguration day are commonplace.\n\nAnd they all appear to share almost the exact same ponderous language. Note the following proclamation from then-President Barack Obama in January of 2008:\n\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2009, a National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation, and call upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century.\n\nOr this one, from then-President George W. Bush in 2001:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 21, 2001, a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving and call upon the citizens of our Nation to gather together in homes and places of worship to pray alone and together and offer thanksgiving to God for all the blessings of this great and good land.\n\nRelated: Trump Escalates His War With Media On First Full Day in Office\n\nTo be sure, the phrase “National Day of Patriotic Devotion” does arguably have echoes of authoritarian nationalism. But given the tenor of Trump’s inaugural address, that’s hardly a shock. What it wasn’t was a declaration of a self-aggrandizing new national holiday."

    "text": "After searching in vain for enthusiasm throughout 2016, Democrats found it in the streets the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration, as over 3 million attended the Women’s Marches to protest the president. Among the masses, you could not only find overflowing energy Democrats could tap into in future campaigns, but an actual policy example to guide the way forward.\n\nI’m talking about hats.\n\nPink hats, to be precise, although they went by a more, er, colorful nickname, a reference to Trump’s boasts about sexual assault on the infamous Access Hollywood tape. The hats became the primary iconography of the marches, with hundreds of thousands of women wearing them as a symbol of resistance to the Trump regime. What makes it more remarkable is how the hats were manufactured and distributed.\n\nRelated: Obama Left Us Much Better Off. Can Trump Top That?​\n\nAs everyone knows, America makes few textiles anymore. The economics are supposed to be next to impossible, with cheap unskilled labor abroad and supply chains constructed to move clothing from Asia or Latin America to U.S. stores. The dominance of national retail chains, which have consolidated over the years and are in the throes of another disruption from Amazon, leaves little room for locally produced goods.\n\nNone of those suppliers and retailers had anything to do with the pink hats. They began in the minds of friends at the Little Knittery in Atwater Village, California. The shop created a pattern — a simple rectangle that would reveal “cat ears” when worn — and posted it for free online. Knitting clubs around the country and around the world started making the hats, selling out local craft stores of their pink yarn. Activists taking on the project identified collection points nationwide for distribution. Knitters gifted hats to their communities; it became a way for those who couldn’t attend the marches to get involved, an outlet for activism from an unlikely source.\n\nI don’t have exact numbers, but I’d estimate that hundreds of thousands of hats were manufactured, shipped and worn in a matter of a few weeks, without the involvement of any big-box store or multinational corporation. Local craft stores supplied the raw materials and local knitters supplied the labor, savoring the dignity that came with their contributions. Their talents were put to use and the money stayed within the community.\n\nRelated: The Best Signs from the Women's March on Washington\n\nI’m not suggesting the entire global textile supply chain could be thrown over in favor of people making hats for each other. But the strain of local self-reliance that permeated the Women’s March could actually serve as a primary rallying point for progressive resurgence.\n\nAs Barry Lynn writes in the Washington Monthly, the path back to respectability for Democrats runs directly through challenging ever-concentrating corporate power, which not only drives inequality and stunts wages but hollows out huge swathes of America and depresses entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nThe greatest threat to this corporate monopoly is a new individualism, a locally focused crusade that gives Americans the freedom to share their skills and control their own destiny. Lynn describes how this would return the Democratic Party to its roots, as an anti-monopoly movement safeguarding citizens from corporate dominance.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces an ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nThat may sound like something Trump promised in his defiant inaugural address, which took aim at the nation’s elites. “The establishment protected itself but not the citizens,” Trump thundered. “While they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.”\n\nThere was some truth in that passage, visible in the faces of forgotten men and women who suffered while elites partied. Twenty-five years of Democratic disconnection from their self-image as the party of the people alienated many voters previously within the coalition. Elites protected their own interests and sold out voiceless workers, while assuring the public that it was for their own good. Despite hundred year-old laws to constrain monopolies, successive governments of both parties have failed to use them since the 1980s, producing a homogenized landscape of Walmarts and chain restaurants and despair in too much of our country, a regional inequality Trump capitalized on during the election.\n\nBut Trump’s version of anti-elite populism conveniently left out corporate elites, who nearly destroyed the economy in the financial crisis and have pursued even more domination in the aftermath. Indeed, plenty of those corporate elites are taking roost in Trump’s cabinet, and his expected selections to police market power specialize more in turning away from enforcement. He’s considering naming Josh Wright, an avowed enthusiast of concentration (and its “significant benefits for consumers”) who has twice been on Google’s payroll, as his head of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.\n\nRelated: Why the Political Mainstream Keeps Failing America’s Workers\n\nThis is the opening for Democrats, and the Women’s March supplied proof of its power. Independent citizens created the signature icon of the protests, through their own labor and ingenuity. This return to localism creates dignity among citizens, and pride in their skills being valuable. Monopolies rob people of the liberty to display those talents. The struggle against monopoly is a struggle for equality, a struggle for the restoration and vibrancy of community, an affirmation of life over control. It encapsulates the struggle for democracy.\n\nThe chroniclers of the establishment snicker that populism is too simple-minded to lead to a better world. But there’s a smart populism that would allow for broader opportunity and prosperity. Some Democrats are beginning to understand that the concept of breaking corporate power provides a framework on which to hang every critique of American politics and economy. But by and large, they have forgotten to tell this story — and after decades of hitting up capital to fund campaigns, too many of them no longer believe it.\n\nWhen you have coal lobbyists running to lead the national party and the board of the outgoing president’s foundation stocked with private equity barons and venture capitalists, rank-and-file progressives can be forgiven for becoming cynical. If Democrats want to return to power, they’ll have to return to their roots. Just follow the pink hats."

    "text": "A watchdog group that had criticized Donald Trump during his time as president-elect over his failure to divest his business holdings has now greeted President Donald Trump with a federal lawsuit claiming that he is violating the Constitution by allowing his company to accept payments from foreign governments. But legal experts are dubious about the suit’s potential for success.\n\nFiled by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the suit claims that by accepting payments from foreign governments, Trump is violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which holds that “no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump's Family and Friends Are in for Heavy Financial Scrutiny\n\nThe suit claims that Trump “has violated the Constitution during the opening moments of his presidency and is poised to do so continually thereafter for the duration of his administration.” Violations occur every time the Trump Organization accepts payment from foreign government sources for the use of his hotels, golf courses, resorts, and other businesses.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC Monday morning, CREW board chairman Norman Eisen, who served as the White House ethics attorney under Barack Obama, was explicit about what the ultimate goal of the suit is: getting access to the tax returns that Trump has consistently refused to make public, even though presidents have routinely done so for 40 years.\n\n“In order to establish the emoluments violations, we are going to need to see the president’s tax returns,” Eisen said. “We’re going to seek them in discovery, so this is a vehicle in order to enforce the Constitution to get those taxes. Seventy-five percent of Americans, many Trump voters agree, we must have them. It’s unprecedented not to. We’re going to get them.”\n\nHowever, successfully bringing a lawsuit requires that the plaintiff has the legal standing to do so, which in this case requires making a credible claim that CREW has suffered an injury from Trump’s alleged violation. Attorneys who have read the group’s complaint, though, were not convinced that it had done so.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nCREW’s claim alleges, “CREW has been forced to divert essential and limited resources—including time and money—from other important matters that it ordinarily would have been handling to the Foreign Emoluments Clause issues involving Defendant, which have consumed the attention of the public and the media.”\n\nGoing forward, it claims, “CREW will essentially be forced into the role of litigating and educating the public regarding Defendant’s Foreign Emoluments Clause violations, rather than continuing its mission of serving as a watchdog on all ethical issues involving all parts of our government.”\n\nJonathan H. Adler, who directs the Center for Business Law and Regulation at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, called it “quite a stretch.”\n\n“The mere fact that they are devoted to the issue and are going to have to spend some time on the issue is not enough,” he said in an interview. “If it worked, then any time any interest group sued over an issue they were focused on,” it would be granted standing, he added.\n\nRelated: Why Stocks Could Have a Rocky First Month Under Trump\n\nIn an analysis of the complaint, Josh Blackman, an Associate Professor of Law at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, agreed, calling the claim “incredibly weak.” Blackman points out that the precedent CREW relies on for its standing claim, Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, addresses a very different set of circumstances than those claimed by CREW, in which a court ruled that the defendant had violated a specific duty to the plaintiff.\n\nWhile Adler and others said that the core of the complaint -- that Trump is in violation of the emoluments clause -- might have merit, others contested even that.\n\n“Standing aside, the merits are what are lacking here. They make over-the-top allegations that are absurd against Mr. Trump, and if there’s a violation of the emoluments clause they haven’t made the case,” said Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch.\n\nFitton’s organization, a conservative-leaning, anti-corruption watchdog group that has spent years on lawsuits related to former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state and recent Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, has been cautiously supportive of Trump’s decision not to divest his business.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nHe said that CREW’s complaint doesn’t show any concrete proof of an emoluments clause violation because it misunderstands the definition of the term.\n\n“It’s a legal word that has meaning, and that’s not what this is,” he said. “It is absurd to suggest that foreign dignitaries going to Trump hotels are an emolument. This is the silly season for the anti-Trump movement.”\n\nDespite the apparent weakness of the standing argument, a number of prominent attorneys attached their names to the complaint, including Harvard University Professor Laurence H. Tribe, University of California-Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, and two former White House ethics lawyers, Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who both serve on CREW’s board of directors. This led many to suggest that actual success in court might be a secondary concern to the plaintiffs.\n\n“This is a way of keeping attention to the emoluments clause issue,” said Prof. Adler of Case Western Reserve. “Sometimes when you file a lawsuit you are as interested in the court of public opinion as you are in a court of law.”\n\nAdditionally, he pointed out, “They may be thinking that filing the suit ... will induce people who might have a stronger standing claim to perhaps join the litigation or file a lawsuit of their own.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/23/Why-Trumps-PEP-Family-and-Friends-Are-Heavy-Financial-Scrutiny",
    "text": "Last Friday, with his swearing-in as president of the United States, Donald Trump joined one of the most exclusive clubs in the world. At the same time that he become one of a handful of living people ever to sit in the Oval Office, he effectively inducted his entire family and all of his close associates into a different club, somewhat less exclusive and far less prestigious.\n\nAs of Friday, the entire Trump family became what is known in international financial and law enforcement circles as “politically exposed persons,” or PEPs. That means that all of their interactions with financial institutions, whether in the United States or in many countries overseas, will automatically become subject to an extra layer of scrutiny in order to protect against proceeds of bribery and official corruption.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nIn addition, the designation could extend to senior executives in the Trump organization who, because of Trump’s refusal to divest himself of ownership in the company, are now effectively employed by the president of the United States. It would also touch on business partners and other people closely associated with the new president.\n\nThe working definition of who falls into the category and who does not is articulated in Article 52 of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, which asks signatories to require financial institutions under their authority “to conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates.”\n\nIt is amplified by guidance issued by the Financial Action Task Force, a membership organization of 36 countries that includes the U.S., European Union, Russia, China, and most major developed nations. FATF defines family members as “individuals who are related to a PEP either directly (consanguinity) or through marriage or similar (civil) forms of partnership.” Close associates, according to FATF are “individuals who are closely connected to a PEP, either socially or professionally.”\n\nAccuity, a company that provides compliance services to banks and other financial institutions, created this chart outlining who might be designated a PEP.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an ‘America First’ Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nThe law enforcement focus on PEPs was heightened dramatically in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as governments around the world struggled to choke off money financing international terrorism. The state-sponsored nature of some terrorism helped expand the focus of anti-terrorism operations to official corruption as well.\n\nThe PEP designation doesn’t come with an assumption of guilt or nefarious activity but is a simple recognition that people close to the levers of governmental power are uniquely able to use their authority for their own personal benefit or to channel public money to non-public uses.\n\nThe designation is not unique to the Trump family. The same would have been true for the families and associates of presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\n\nWhat is unique to the Trump clan is its continued operation of a string of for-profit businesses in many countries around the world. President Trump, notably, refused to divest himself of his business holdings, insisting that he could satisfy all concerns about conflicts of interest by passing day-to-day management authority to his two adult sons.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nThe companies in the Trump Organization, and potentially their senior executives, will now find their financial transactions attracting much closer scrutiny from banks and other institutions that reserve a higher level of vetting, known as “enhanced due diligence,” for deals involving PEPs.\n\nGiven Trump’s decades in the business world, not to mention his collection of ex-wives, and his daughter’s marriage to the scion of another wealthy real estate empire, that extra attention will likely spread to a much larger collection of people than it has under previous US administrations."

    "text": "If you want to check out the financial health of companies like Amazon, Amgen or Apple, it is easy to do so. Just go to Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, CNBC or any of a host of other web sites, type in the company name or ticker symbol, and you can see full financial profiles of each company. Some sites also make it easy to compare the earnings performance of multiple companies.\n\nBut what if you want to see the financial status of cities like Amarillo, Akron or Alexandria? It’s not so simple. Because these cities had fewer than 200,000 people in 2015, they were not included in our City Financial Strength Index published earlier this month. Other groups that collect and publish local government financial data, like Truth in Accounting, also focus on just the biggest cities. Creating a comprehensive resource for government finance would be a complex and costly undertaking.\n\nRelated: How Strong Are Your City's Finances? 116 US Cities Ranked\n\nYet the need for such a resource is real. An online database of local government financial statistics would provide early warning of potential fiscal crises. Since fiscal crises trigger public employee layoffs, deep service cuts and sharp tax increases, they affect a large cross section of the community. By identifying which governments are most vulnerable, policymakers and citizens can take early action to avoid or minimize such emergencies. A fiscal data repository would help researchers answer such questions as whether bankruptcy filings by Stockton, San Bernardino and Detroit were straws in the wind presaging a more generalized problem, or were they exceptional events not likely to be widely repeated? And, which financial data points are the best indicators of future trouble (while I believe the indicators and weightings I used for the Financial Strength Index were appropriate, others differ)?\n\nHistorically, we have relied on rating agencies to assess government financial health, but Department of Justice settlements with S&P and Moody’s over their actions that precipitated the financial crisis, suggest that we need alternative measurements. Also, many cities do not carry credit ratings. An online database would also help us assess relative government performance, showing us which units are spending their tax dollars more or less efficiently. And, it would let us see how spending priorities differ across governments, letting us determine whether they are properly emphasizing public safety or social services.\n\nThe Current Mess\n\nMost major cities publish their budgets on their websites, but budgets contain forecast revenues and expenditures, which are not completely accurate. Budgets are also not well standardized, making peer comparisons difficult. Even though they’re less timely, actual financial statements certified by an independent auditor are the better choice for analyzing financial performance across governments.\n\nRelated: Chicago, New York in Worst Financial Shape Among Large US Cities\n\nMost major cities (as well as counties, states and special districts) also publish audited financial statements in a document known as a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or CAFR). The Government Finance Officers Association sets standards for these reports and awards a “Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting” to filers meeting these standards. The core of the CAFR, the government’s basic financial statements, must adhere to principles set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board (notably, New Jersey cities do not use this standard.)\n\nWhile these annual financial reports possess a wealth of useful information about government financial condition, they are not widely used. Historically, the documents have been hard to find, and, because their data is locked in PDFs, they are difficult to analyze.\n\nFinding the reports has become much easier in recent years. While in the 1990s, obtaining a CAFR might have required a trip to the library or municipal building, now these documents are generally online. State and local governments that issue municipal bonds usually post their CAFRs on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s EMMA system. Unfortunately, finding CAFRs through the system is not straightforward: EMMA was designed to provide information about individual municipal bonds, not as a database of government financial statistics.\n\nRelated: 15 States Americans Are Ditching: What’s the Matter With Wyoming?\n\nRecently, the federal government has launched a new resource that eases the process of finding and downloading local government financial statements. Governments and non-profits receiving federal funds above a certain threshold (currently $750,000 annually) are required to submit audited financial statements to the federal government. Last year, the Census Bureau, which collects these statements, started to place new local government audits online with a somewhat more user-friendly interface than EMMA. Finally, many states have CAFR repositories. Good examples are those provided by Illinois, Michigan and Washington State.\n\nStill, extracting and standardizing the data from these reports remains challenging. Three years ago, the Sunlight Foundation held a hackathon to tackle the issue of “scraping” data from PDFs and none of the developers attending could come up with a good solution for CAFR data extraction. Since then, software tools facilitating PDF data extraction have only improved marginally.\n\nA Better Way\n\nA more useful approach is to move away from PDF filings and instead encourage or require governments to submit their financial statements in a “machine readable format” like XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). It would then be possible to create an online, searchable repository of government financial statistics. (The Census Bureau does currently provide annual state and local financial data, but, because the Census information is derived from a survey rather than the audited reports, it is inconsistent with CAFR data, unaudited and limited in scope.)\n\nRelated: The Financial Health of All 50 States, Ranked\n\nThe implementation of a machine-readable filing standard is one reason why standardized corporate financial data is so much more readily available than government data. Since the 1990s, the SEC has made corporate financial statement filings (Forms 10-K and 10-Q) available in a text format known as SGML, which is much easier to process than PDFs. In 2009, the SEC began requiring companies to file their financial statements in XBRL, which better enforces standardization across filings and internal consistency of data within a single filing.\n\nWith the 2014 enactment of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, the federal government embraced the use of machine readable fiscal data. The act requires the executive branch to “establish Government-wide data standards for financial data and provide consistent, reliable, and searchable Government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for taxpayers and policy makers.” DATA Act implementation, which is being led by OMB and the Treasury Department, includes an XBRL schema that facilitates standard reporting of federal expenditures.\n\nCorporate and federal XBRL filing standards offer useful precedents for a state and local government standard, which has been slow to emerge. While some existing projects are in preliminary stages, larger organizations that could all promote a single standard have yet to do so. Congressional action may be required: A bill that would have mandated a machine-readable municipal financial filing standard proposed in the last Congress died despite attracting 35 cosponsors. Perhaps this idea could be resurrected as part of Dodd-Frank changes expected in the current Congress. Citizens interested in understanding the financial health of their cities would benefit."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/23/There-s-Less-Trump-s-Obamacare-Executive-Order-Some-Suggest",
    "text": "For all of the controversy and anxiety it stirred up over the weekend, there is still considerable uncertainty over the practical impact of the executive order newly inaugurated President Donald Trump signed Friday night instructing federal agencies to use any methods allowed by law to dismantle key elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump made good on his campaign pledge to take action his first day in office to begin the unprecedented task of wholly repealing and replacing a major modern-era health care program by signing the order. His executive order reaffirmed his intention to seek “prompt repeal” of former President Barack Obama’s signature health insurance program which covers more than 20 million Americans.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nThe House and Senate last week approved a budget resolution under special reconciliation rules as the first important step towards dismantling Obamacare and replacing it with a GOP plan. Trump’s executive order is designed to try to speed up Obamacare’s demise from within the executive branch.\n\nThe order instructs federal agencies – including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service -- to “exercise all authority and discretion available to them” to waive, defer or delay any provision of the law that imposes fiscal hardship on individuals, families, insurers or the health care industry.\n\nThe goal is to hasten the demise of a four-year-old subsidized health care program that has been plagued by soaring premiums and co-payments, the collapse of more than 20 experimental co-ops, and major financial losses by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield and other that have driven out of some markets. Yet, Obamacare enrollment for the 2017 season is setting records and the nationwide rate of uninsured has dipped below 10 percent – its lowest point ever.\n\nSign ups don’t always translate into premium payments, of course, and the lowered insurance rate can be credited equally to the ACA’s expanded Medicaid option and the health care exchanges.\n\nRelated: Trump Escalates His War With Media On First Full Day in Office\n\nWhile Trump’s executive order doesn’t specify actions that might be taken, the news media and others have speculated that they could include granting states and insurance companies much wider latitude in setting minimum standards for drug and medical treatment provided and creating a freer and more open market. The Washington Post speculated that the order could end up unwinding regulations that include enforcement of the penalty for people who fail to carry health care insurance.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, said on Sunday that the new administration may stop enforcing the mandate requiring most Americans to carry health insurance even before Congress repeals Obamacare –- but without explaining how that would be accomplished.\n\n“What President Trump is doing is, he wants to get rid of that Obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of Americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health insurance,” she said on ABC News’ This Week.\n\nHowever, while the one-page executive order exhorts federal agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act to the maximum extent permitted by law,” some healthcare experts say the new administration edict would have far less authority to weaken Obamacare than many assume.\n\n“I think Trump has done what he promised his voters he would do, which is to put out an executive order on the first day in office, beginning the process of rolling back the Affordable Care Act” Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee College and an expert on health care, said in an interview. “So I don’t know that we’re going to see a lot more out of him in the coming weeks.”\n\nJost said that there are limits to what Trump and his agency heads can do on the administrative front without going through a long and tortured federal rule-making process. He told VOX.com in a separate interview, “I think he’s been advised that he can’t repeal the Affordable Care Act through executive action, and now we see where this goes.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nIndeed, many of the provisions that Trump and his GOP allies are determined to root out – especially premium subsidies for lower-income Americans, mandates, and taxes on insurers and businesses and financial penalties for individuals who fail to purchase coverage – are embedded in law and can only be changed by congressional action.\n\nThe individual mandate, which requires uninsured Americas to purchase coverage under the threat of penalty on their federal tax returns, is essential to forcing younger, healthier people to join the pool of beneficiaries and help offset the cost of coverage for older, sicker people. Without the mandate, insurers couldn’t make a profit.\n\nBut that mandate has not panned out. After doing the math, many younger Americans have opted to pay the penalty rather than sign up for Obamacare and expensive premiums, which they cannot afford. So they’re taking their chances that they remain healthy and avoid serious accidents.\n\nWhile the Obama administration often granted hardship waivers to people facing penalties, experts say it is highly unlikely the Trump administration could greatly expand the waivers without congressional authorization.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump’s executive order “is more of an admonition and political statement than an instruction to act.” He predicted that little will happen internally until Trump gets his health care team in place – and that may not be for a while.\n\nRep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, has run into tough opposition from the Democrats during his Senate confirmation process because of allegations he repeatedly engaged in insider stock trading as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Those hearings could drag on until the middle of February or longer. Without Price and Seema Verma, Trump’s choice to head the HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in place, there is relatively little the new administration can do to alter Obamacare.\n\n“Any concrete action will require leadership from the Secretary of HHS,” Antos said in an email. “Acting officials are careerists who generally won’t get out ahead of the politics. Tom Price would have some ideas about what could be slowed down or not pursued, but he won’t be Secretary very soon.\n\nLarry Levitt, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and an expert on Obamacare, said in an email, “The [Trump] order doesn’t by itself do anything, but it signals the direction the Trump Administration intends to go in.”\n\nRelated: Trump Promises to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nLevitt noted that the Obama Administration delayed the enforcement of a number of rules and penalties, including a mandate for businesses to provide health insurance to their employees, so there certainly is precedent for the Trump administration to come up with other waivers and exceptions.\n\nYet unless Trump and the Republicans are willing to risk the complete collapse of the individual insurance market before they can agree on a suitable replacement, they will have to be careful not to spook insurers too much – especially after the release of Trump’s executive order on Friday night.\n\n“One thing for sure is that this order creates significant uncertainty for insurers just as they are deciding whether to participate in the individual market for 2018 and how much to increase premiums,” Levitt said."

    "text": "This should have been a celebratory weekend for the new Trump administration – a jubilant time for newly inaugurated President Donald Trump and his top aides who assumed the reins of power on Friday with a populist vow to push aside the political establishment and “Make America Great Again.”\n\nInstead, Trump’s first full day as president on Saturday was one bitter fighting with the news media and the former head of the CIA. At the same time, millions of Americans marched in Washington and scores of cities across the country to protest Trump’s election and policies that threaten women’s rights, illegal immigrants, health care coverage for more than 20 million people, and long-standing international alliances.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\nThe day’s events were both breathtaking and alarming, as Trump and his new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, appeared unhinged at times as they clashed with reporters and bitterly complained that the media had vastly understated the size of the crowd on hand for Trump’s swearing in ceremony. The White House also complained about what proved to be an inaccurate tweet by a Time Magazine reporter that Trump had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump appears to be digging in for what is likely to be a long and contentious relationship with the news media that could mean less access for reporters or even eviction from the current White House press room. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus did little on Sunday to try to calm the roiled waters, declaring on Fox News Sunday that Trump won’t allow his critics in the media and elsewhere to delegitimize his presidency.\n\n“I’m saying there’s an obsession by the media to delegitimize this president and we are not going to sit around and let it happen” Priebus said. “We’re going to fight back, tooth and nail, every day.”\n\nWithout conceding that the president and Spicer had grossly exaggerated the size of the inaugural day crowd, claiming that as many as 1.5 million people had turned out when it was closer to 250,000, Priebus said the controversy “is really not about crowd size, what it’s about is honesty in the media.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nTrump’s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, also complained about the “unfair” treatment of Trump during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. She added, “I don’t think ultimately presidents are judged by crowd sizes at their inauguration, I think they are judged by their accomplishments.”\n\nConway and Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd then engaged in an extraordinary, protracted argument over why Trump sent Spicer into the White House press room to deliver an obvious lie about the size of the inaugural crowd on Friday.\n\n“Why was it necessary to send out the press secretary on his first day in office to utter a provable falsehood that now calls into question everything the press secretary will say from here on out for many Americans?” Todd asked. “What was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?”\n\n“Your job is not to call something ridiculous that is said by our press secretary and our president, that’s not your job,” Conway fired back. “You’re a news person, you’re not an opinion columnist. Think about what you just said to your viewers. That’s why we feel compelled to go out and clear the air.”\n\nRelated: ‘America First’: Full Text of President Trump’s Inaugural Address\n\nConway never answered Todd’s question, saying instead that the news media should devote more energy to highlighting the “provable, quantifiable facts” that Trump outlined in his acceptance speech, including the “devastation and destruction” in our schools, with our health care system, the economy and national security efforts against terrorists.\n\nFor his part, Trump spent the morning downplaying the importance of Saturday’s protest in Washington by an estimated half million people, tweeting that “Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn’t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.”\n\nLater, however, he leavened his critique, tweeting that “Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don’t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump used a visit to the CIA – intended as a peacemaking gesture after weeks of clashing with the intelligence community over its assessments of Russian hacking and interference in the U.S. election—to tee off against journalists, who he called “the most dishonest human beings on Earth,” according to an account by The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\nTrump called out Zeke Miller, the Time magazine reporter who mistakenly tweeted a report that the Martin Luther King Jr. bust had been removed from the Oval Office and subsequently apologized and corrected the report. But other reporters had already reported the missing bust as fact. “They said that ‘Donald Trump took down the bust — the statue of Dr. Martin Luther King. But it was right there,” Trump told the CIA gathering. “There was a cameraman that was in front of it.”\n\nTrump sought to express his gratitude to the intelligence community, despite repeatedly railing against it during the transition and likening alleged leaks of unflattering and unsubstantiated intelligence about Trump to a Nazi-style smear. Standing before the CIA’s hallowed wall of stars honoring the agency’s fallen, Trump launched into a rambling, campaign-style monolog blaming the media for stoking dissension between him and intelligence agencies.\n\n“I have a running war with the media,” Trump declared. “They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth, right?”\n\nTrump’s statement drew laughter and applause from dozens of CIA employees who showed up for the meeting on their day off and other Trump loyalists. But John Brennan, who resigned Friday as CIA Director at the conclusion of the Obama administration, said through a spokesperson that he was saddened and angry at Trump’s “despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA’s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes.” Brennan added that Trump “should be ashamed of himself.”\n\nSpicer later summoned reporters to the White House briefing room for a tongue-lashing, falsely insisting that more than 700,000 people stretched from the West Front of the Capitol down the Mall to the Washington Monument to observe Trump’s inauguration. He falsely insisted that the turnout was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period – both in person and around the globe.”\n\nFigures from Nielsen confirm that 31 million people watched the Trump inauguration worldwide—but that was still 9 million less than Obama’s inauguration in 2009.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nMany reporters were shocked that Spicer would use his maiden appearance at the White House podium to advance the preposterous notion that the turnout for Trump’s inauguration was larger than that of President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, or that Trump’s crowd reached all the way to the Washington Monument. Side by side aerial photographs of the Mall taken shortly before noon during those two events showed that Trump had grossly exaggerated the size of his crowd.\n\nSpicer refused to take questions from the reporters but set an ominous tone before stalking out of the press room: “There’s been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways,” he said. “We’re going to hold the press accountable as well.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/22/Obama-Left-Us-Much-Better-Now-8-Years-Ago-Can-Trump-Top",
    "text": "With Donald Trump now ensconced in the White House, that makes two improbable presidents in a row. All the marchers in America can’t stomp out the fact that both Barack Obama and Trump entered office with four sizeable similarities.\n\nBoth began their quests for the presidency as political novices: Obama was a young, African-American former community organizer without even a full term as a U.S. senator under his belt. Trump was an aging real-estate mogul with a second career as a reality TV star and had never held public office.\n\nRelated: What We Will Miss Most About Obama\n\nBoth owe a debt of gratitude to Hillary Clinton because the undeniable and immeasurable antipathy toward her by so many Americans won them votes they might otherwise have never received. In Trump’s case, his victory was as much a vote for a true outsider and symbol of change as it was a defeat for a consummate insider and a symbol of business as usual.\n\nBoth (plus Bernie Sanders) recognized what the Washington Establishment did not – that “It’s my turn” coronations either in primaries or the general election are a dead concept. Mitt Romney didn’t get that. Clinton didn’t get it twice. And both had the winds of audacity at their backs. In Obama’s case, it was the audacity of hope. In Trump’s, it was just unvarnished audacity.\n\nA less politically significant similarity is that they both seem to be loving fathers, though that is not a quality in a leader to be dismissed. Beyond all that, however, Obama and Trump are polar opposites when it comes to their approach – to politics and, from what we have seen so far, to America’s challenges.\n\nIn 2009, it cannot be said often enough, Obama was dealt the worst hand of any president since FDR. Certainly, Richard Nixon was left a bed of thorns by Lyndon Johnson: the bright and shining lie of the Vietnam War, a nation torn apart and confused and a particularly weak economy.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Brand of Nationalism Reinforces a Divisive ‘Us v. Them’ Playbook\n\nBut Nixon didn’t have to contend with two unfinished wars (one as unnecessary as Vietnam); a devastating financial crisis that threw millions out of work and homes, blew the doors off the stock market and decimated savings; plus a failing auto industry.\n\nAs inexperienced as Obama was, he looked toward the uncertain future with homegrown faith and rallied American spirits with his rhetoric.\n\nIn his first Inaugural Address, Obama said, “We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week, or last month, or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. “\n\nEight years later, a visitor from the Red Planet listening in the rain to Trump’s Inaugural Address might be forgiven for thinking the economy remains in shambles, the unemployment rate is still in double digits, the Dow is dismal and Detroit is shuttering its factories.\n\nRelated: Trump Era Begins with Moves Against Regulations, Obamacare\n\n“Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves,” Trump said. “These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”\n\nSure, we have plenty of problems, not the least of which is a major city that should have been locked down and cleaned out years ago. But “carnage”? Really?\n\nYou want “carnage,” time-travel back eight years and take a look at the landscape of a frightened America, a country on its economic knees, blood running out of its nose, eyes pleading for hope.\n\nTo not recognize where America was then and where it is now is to dishonor the hard work and heroics of names like Paulson (Hank not John), Geithner, Bair, Bernanke, Petraeus, and McChrystal, to cite a handful.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\nWe wanted “Morning in America.” We got “Mourning in America.”\n\nThat’s fine. Trump is not Obama. He runs hot and dark; Obama runs maybe too cool and glossily optimistic. But in crafting his grim, nationalistic call to arms, Trump’s speech writers (as identified by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday), Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, might have given the outgoing centrist president his due: Obama already made America great again.\n\nThe new president’s job is to build on that astonishing recovery and make us greater."

    "text": "The extraordinarily nationalistic tone of President Donald Trump’s inaugural address on Friday surprised many Americans who are used to hearing presidents use that particular moment to deliver hopeful remarks about a kind of national greatness that extends beyond simple self-interest.\n\nHowever, the bluntness of Trump’s “America First” vision of the country’s relationship with the rest of the world and his call for “total allegiance” to the country -- presumably the country as he believes it should be -- probably didn’t come as much of a shock to people who had been paying close attention to the stump speeches of candidate Trump, or even his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an ‘America First’ Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nThe inaugural address would also have sounded quite familiar to other listeners, particularly some on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTrump’s vision of a United States turned inward is, in many ways, an echo of calls for more nationalism that can be heard right now from the anti-immigrant hard-right National Front in France. It was on display last year, as advocates of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, particularly the UK Independence Party, pressed their case. From the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been relentlessly pressing a renewed Russian nationalism.\n\nIndeed, appeals to the preservation of national identities have been heard across Europe for years now, particularly in countries that have seen large inflows of migrants, and they often come with a side order of racism and religious bigotry.\n\nSo it was no real surprise when, on Saturday, the White House dispensed with the fiction that the president wrote Friday’s speech himself, and admitted that the words had been heavily influenced, if not outright written, by a pair of his closest aides. One of them is Trump’s chief strategist and senior White House counselor, Steve Bannon, a self-professed “economic nationalist.”\n\nRelated: ‘America First’: Full Text of President Trump’s Inaugural Address\n\nA former Goldman Sachs banker who went on to make a small fortune in movie and television production, Bannon took over the right-wing Breitbart News in 2012. The site became an unabashed supporter of Trump’s campaign, which Bannon eventually joined himself last August. (Bannon rejects the accusations that Breitbart has become a forum for not just nationalists, but for white nationalists.)\n\nBannon’s comments in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter late last year, in which he claimed the economic nationalist mantle, could have been the rough draft of part of Trump’s inaugural address.\n\n“The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia,” he told reporter Michael Wolff. “The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver, we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.\"\n\nIt’s a vision that Bannon has had consistently for some time. In a lengthy question and answer session delivered to a conference at the Vatican in 2014, Bannon laid out his vision of how the world is being realigned by a new political reality in which national identity plays a central role.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\n“Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement,” he said, according to the audio of the event obtained by Buzzfeed. “We’ve seen that. We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front National and other center-right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that will all be worked through with time.”\n\nThose remarks bear a striking similarity to Trump’s inaugural address in their contempt for a globalist worldview and their call for a return to traditionalism and nationalism. They also help explain the deference that the Trump campaign has shown to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Bannon referred to as a kleptocrat, even as he acknowledged his success in rallying the Russian people behind him.\n\nI think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty of their country, they want to see nationalism for their country. They don’t believe in this kind of pan-European Union, or they don’t believe in the centralized government in the United States. They’d rather see more of a States-based entity that the founders originally set up where freedoms were controlled at the local level.\n\nHowever, we the Judeo-Christian West have to look at what [Putin is] talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it’s what can see us forward.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nThe fact that the only specific issue of global concern that Trump mentioned in his inaugural address was the fight against the terror group ISIS can be chalked up to Bannon as well. Trump pledged to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.”\n\nIn Bannon’s worldview, the fight against militant Islam is the single biggest threat -- “a war of immense proportions” -- that takes precedence over things like Russian aggression.\n\n“[A]t the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that wants to expand,” he said to the audience in Rome. “However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you’re facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying we can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.”\n\nThat tracks very closely with Trump’s repeated insistence that the US should look away from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and evidence of massive war crimes in Syria, and focus instead on convincing Putin to assist the US in fighting ISIS.\n\nAt the earliest stages of the Trump presidency, it’s impossible to know where the former reality television star who now sits in the Oval Office will take the country. But Friday’s inaugural address made it pretty clear who will be giving him the directions."

    "text": "For tens of millions of Americans, the start of a new year means the counter has gone back to zero on their health insurance deductibles. If they need health care, they’ll pay for some of it out of their own pockets before their insurance takes over.\n\nBut what do those plans mean for people with common chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, joint problems, and heart disease? The short answer: a hit to their wallets.\n\nRelated: Rising Health Care Costs Will Push the Nation’s Debt Into High-Risk Territory\n\nPeople with chronic conditions who choose deductible-based plans should be prepared to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars of their own money on their care—perhaps even beyond what they spend to buy the insurance plan in the first place.\n\nThe results of a new study show the impact of high-deductible health plans that now cover 40 percent of Americans who buy their own health insurance or get it through an employer. Data from a national survey of Americans younger than 65 show that having a high-deductible plan makes it more likely that health-related costs will take up more than 10 percent of a chronically ill person’s total income.\n\nResearchers uncovered wide disparities in out-of-pocket spending among patients with the same condition, even for those in low-deductible plans. Despite these out-of-pocket costs, few people with chronic illnesses say costs or insurance coverage issues had gotten in the way of getting the care or prescriptions they needed.\n\n“Increasingly, these plans have become woven into the fabric of health insurance in America, so it’s important to look at the impact of deductibles on people who need care on an ongoing basis,” says senior author Jeffrey Kullgren, assistant professor of general medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\n“Not only on how they spend their money on care for their everyday health needs but also how that affects spending in the rest of their lives.”\n\nRelated: Health Care Costs for Average American Family Now Exceed $25,000 a Year\n\nOut-of-pocket spending\n\nFor the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Kullgren and first author Joel E. Segel, a health economist at Penn State, analyzed data from 17,177 people interviewed for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data were collected from 2011 to 2013 when many more employers started offering high-deductible health plans.\n\nOf all the respondents, slightly more than 4,100 had a high-deductible health plan, and more than 7,600 had a chronic health condition. About 45 percent of those with high-deductible plans had at least one chronic condition.\n\nResearchers looked at data from people who had heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, joint diseases, cancer (except for skin cancer), and mood disorders such as depression. They compared those patients’ out-of-pocket costs against those of individuals with none of these conditions. The data encompassed those who had plans with high deductibles, low deductibles, and no deductibles.\n\n“One challenge of high-deductible health plans is that clinical decisions made in a doctor’s office are often completely disconnected from the reality of what a patient has to pay out of pocket.”\n\nRelated: US Health Care Costs Surge to 17 Percent of GDP\n\nIn 2013, a plan was considered high deductible if it asked patients to pay the first $1,250 in care costs for an individual or $2,500 for a family. Only people with deductibles above this amount qualify to open a health savings account that lets them put away cash to use tax-free to pay for some health costs.\n\nThe data primarily come from the time before people who needed to buy their own insurance could do so on the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Since the launch of the marketplace, more than 90 percent of shoppers have chosen high-deductible plans.\n\nLower-income people who choose silver-level marketplace plans can get assistance with out-of-pocket costs from the federal government. But those who opt for bronze-level plans with high deductibles—but lower monthly premium costs—aren’t eligible for deductible help. Neither are people who make more than the income limit or receive coverage outside of the marketplace.\n\n“If changes in health policy remove marketplace subsidies, that could rewind the clock to the era we studied,” says Kullgren, who specializes in studying the impact of consumer-directed health care plans—a phrase that encompasses those with high deductibles or other cost-sharing arrangements.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nWhat will it cost?\n\nHe also studies how the companies that run such plans or offer them to their employees can help participants understand the costs and medical choices they will be responsible for.\n\n“A lot of plans, employers, and policymakers are using these plans as vehicles to make consumers more active in their care, more cost-conscious, and more interested in optimizing the value of their care,” Kullgren says. “This includes offering price-transparency tools that people can use to see what the care they need will cost and quality tools to show which hospitals or providers offer the best value.\n\n“But we don’t know yet how often people are using these tools to help them get the care they need and avoid the care they don’t need, nor how well the tools serve their needs. We need to focus on helping people who are in these plans use them better.”\n\nKullgren is analyzing national survey data from people enrolled in high-deductible health plans who were asked about these topics. He is also partnering with Priority Health, a major private insurer, to design a pilot project that will launch early this year. It will test a price transparency tool that patients and health providers can use together, during a clinical appointment, to make decisions based on medical need and cost.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\n“One challenge of high-deductible health plans is that clinical decisions made in a doctor’s office are often completely disconnected from the reality of what a patient has to pay out of pocket,” he says. “Patients have to decide whether and where to get a service, such as an operation, lab test, or medical imaging exam, that they must pay for under their plan. These are decisions where clinicians can help patients navigate—and in some cases help them avoid care they don’t need.”\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and Penn State and from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System are coauthors of the study."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/21/Trump-Era-Begins-Moves-Against-Regulations-Obamacare",
    "text": "President Donald Trump got something of a late start on Friday after an inaugural parade ran late and left marchers trudging past empty bleachers in the rain and dark. But on his way to a trio of inaugural balls, Trump took the time to authorize a flurry of actions signaling his new administration’s intention to shake up Washington.\n\nFrom a blanket instruction that all federal agencies should immediately suspend any pending rules or regulations to a vaguely worded executive order instructing those same agencies to relieve the “burden” imposed on citizens and businesses by the Affordable Care Act, Trump’s early moves reflected the breadth and depth of his plan to remake the country in a new image.\n\nRelated: Trump Outlines an ‘America First’ Agenda in a Dark Inaugural Address\n\nThe White House website was completely overhauled, virtually erasing the legacy of Trump’s predecessor, former president Barack Obama. Gone were plans to protect the environment and provide assistance to undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, replaced by promises of increased fossil fuel extraction and border walls.\n\nIn what many viewed as a rather odd choice, the first clearly stated change in policy from the new administration was the shelving of a plan to lower insurance premiums for low-income homeowners who hold Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages. The insurance premiums were increased during the housing crisis to reflect the increased risk of borrowers defaulting on mortgage loans, which cost taxpayers $1.7 billion during the Great Recession.\n\nWith improvements in the economy and a strengthening housing market, the Obama administration had determined that it was time to lower premiums again -- a move that would have saved borrowers roughly $500 per year. The plan was opposed by Republicans, who warned that it could put taxpayers on the hook for a bailout in the event of another housing market crash. On Friday, the Trump administration announced that the premium reduction, set to take effect later this month, had been suspended indefinitely.\n\nAlso Friday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus issued a memo to all federal agencies placing a freeze on new regulatory actions “to ensure that the President's appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations.”\n\nRelated: Trump Again Calls for Rebuilding US Infrastructure in Inaugural Address\n\nThe move, a common practice for incoming administrations of both parties, instructs agencies to refrain from publishing new rules, and in the case of regulatory actions that have been announced but have not yet taken effect, it instructs agencies to delay their implementation where possible. The memo makes exceptions for emergency measures and rules that have to be completed by statutory deadlines.\n\nBut it was Trump’s executive order on Obamacare that garnered the most attention Friday night, primarily because it was unclear exactly what its impact would be. The order stated that it is the policy of the new administration to seek repeal of the law, but said that in the interim it would look to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens” associated with it.\n\nTo that end, Trump ordered all federal agencies to “exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”\n\nThe broad language of the order suggested that Trump might require federal agencies charged with enforcing elements of the ACA, like the individual mandate requiring every US resident to have a health insurance policy, to stop enforcing them. If that were to happen, experts warned, it could have dire and almost immediate effects on the market for individual health insurance policies, with younger, healthier patients abandoning their coverage, and health insurers reconsidering whether or not to offer policies to a population that has suddenly become older, sicker, and more expensive to cover.\n\nRelated: ‘America First’: Full Text of President Trump’s Inaugural Address\n\nWhile Trump did not issue a large number of orders Friday night, there were clear signals that much more is coming. Almost within minutes of Trump taking the oath of office, the official White House website was wiped clean of any trace of former President Obama’s policies and populated with many of Trump’s key policy objectives.\n\nThe new 45th president “believes the United States has incredible potential and will go on to exceed anything that it has achieved in the past,” the website declared. “His campaign slogan was Make America Great Again, and that is exactly what he intends to do.\n\nThe new Trump White House site outlined a series of hardline stands on law enforcement, defense, foreign policy, and trade; renewed Trump’s promises to grow the economy through corporate and individual tax cuts and unleash energy production and “clean coal” technology. Trump pledged to create 25 million new jobs in the coming decade.\n\nRelated: GOP Governors Voice Alarm About Losing Expanded Medicaid\n\nThe new administration vowed to rescind Obama’s Climate Action Plan aimed at combating global warming while pulling the plug on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and renegotiate the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe Trump White House reiterated its pledge to greatly build up the military, wipe out ISIS and other terrorist groups, increase cyber-security capabilities, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, develop a “state of the art missile defense system” against possible attacks by North Korea and Iran, and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes.\n\n\"He is dedicated to enforcing our border laws, ending sanctuary cities, and stemming the tide of lawlessness associated with illegal immigration,\" the White House website declared.\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\nAnd in further describing Trump’s foreign policy ambition, the site reads that \"In pursuing a foreign policy based on American interests, we will embrace diplomacy. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.\"\n\nOddly, though, the website is silent about the health care law and Trump’s pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Eviscerating President Obama’s signature health insurance program was a central issue in Trump’s campaign, and he and GOP congressional leaders currently are brainstorming ways to simultaneously repeal key portions of Obamacare and replace them with a more market-oriented system.\n\nAt the same time, Trump aides yanked a climate change section off the website and declined to replace it except for a fleeting mention of Obama’s Climate Action Plan, a series of efforts to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has yet to provide any definitive word on whether the U.S. will continue to abide by the international global warming agreement reached in Paris a year ago. Nor has he disavowed previous assertions that climate change was a “hoax” perpetrated by the Chinese, although several of his cabinet nominees have acknowledged that climate change is partially man-made and a threat to the globe."

    "text": "President Donald Trump shied away from a lengthy laundry list of promises on the economy in his inaugural speech on Friday, instead delivering sweeping pronouncements about making America great again and vastly improving the fortunes of a “forgotten” middle class.\n\n“From this day forward it’s going to be only America first, America first,” Trump said during his 20-minute address on the West Front of the Capitol. “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.”\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nOne notable exception to that was the billionaire businessman’s determined effort to foster $1 trillion or more of major infrastructure spending in the coming years to complement his tax cut and other economic policies for creating more jobs.\n\n“For many decades we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for a very sad depletion of our military,” Trump said. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.”\n\n“We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation,” he pledged. “We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor,” he added.\n\nTrump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign to at least double Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s infrastructure investment target. His detailed proposal depends heavily on private investors, with the federal government encouraging investment by providing highly generous federal tax credits.\n\nRelated: Here’s Why It Will Be So Hard for Trump or Clinton to Rebuild America\n\nHowever, that plan has encountered resistance on Capitol Hill from both Republicans who are concerned about adding to the debt and Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) who argue it won’t do enough to spur economic growth.\n\nNotably, 66 percent of Americans oppose Trump’s plan that would offer nearly $140 billion in federal tax credits to private investors that back transportation projects, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nTrump has not yet provided a more definitive outline of his infrastructure initiative, although he has promised to unveil it within the first 100 days of his administration. Two of his economic advisers, Peter Navarro, a University of California-Irvine business professor and Wilbur Ross, a billionaire private-equity investor who has been nominated to head the Commerce Department, contend that the offer of $137 billion of tax credits to private firms could unleash a total of $1 trillion of new investments in transportation projects.\n\nRelated: As Roads Crumble, Infrastructure Spending Hits a 30-Year Low\n\nBut critics say the plan is highly unconventional and will only attract investors to projects that can recoup their investment costs through revenue streams, such as tolls or user fees, according to The Hill.\n\nLiberal Democrats are keen on developing an infrastructure program that goes well beyond the renewed federal highway authorization legislation approved last year, but favor increased spending or taxes to finance it.\n\nPelosi told reporters last week that she and other Democrats would be willing to negotiate with the Trump administration on a compromise measure, “as long as it’s a real infrastructure bill that rebuilds the infrastructure of America, creates good-paying jobs, increase the paycheck of American workers and is not a tax break at the high end, disguised as an infrastructure bill.”"

    "text": "President Donald Trump, in his inaugural address, revisited the themes of his presidential campaign, describing an America in economic and social decline. The country, he said, is being “ravaged” from without by foreign competition and faces “carnage” within as a result of self-dealing politicians, failing schools and “the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”\n\nIn his relatively brief remarks, given just moments after he took the oath of office on the steps of the US Capitol, Trump described a nation of “mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities” and “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.”\n\nRelated: ‘America First’: Full Text of President Trump’s Inaugural Address\n\nAs he did for nearly a year and a half on the campaign trail, Trump outlined his remedy: protectionist trade policies, massive spending on infrastructure, and a resurgence in patriotism. That last element, he suggested will bring Americans together in common purpose and help drive the country forward.\n\n“At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other,” he said. “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.”\n\nThroughout his remarks, Trump returned to the idea that with his election, power was being returned to the people, at the expense of a corrupt elite who have used it to enrich themselves.\n\nAlmost immediately, he went on the attack against the Washington establishment, referring to “a small group in our nation's capital [that] has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.”\n\nRelated: 8 Steps Trump Could Take on ‘Day One’ to Remake the Country\n\nIt was a marked departure from many past inaugural addresses, which have frequently urged citizens toward service and self-sacrifice. Exactly 56 years ago, delivering his inaugural address on the same steps where Trump stood Friday, John F. Kennedy urged Americans to “ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.”\n\nSpeaking directly to those who supported him during the election, Trump outlined a very different way of thinking about the country and its relationship to the people.\n\nHe described his supporters as participants in a movement “the likes of which the world has never seen before.”\n\nHe continued, “At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.”\n\nRelated: Why All the Ethical Problems of Trump’s Cabinet Nominees Won’t Matter\n\nAnd he left no question about where the government would get the resources to deliver on those promises -- not from hard work and self-sacrifice so much as by disengaging with the wider world.\n\nIn fact, the speech seemed to signal a major retrenchment in US foreign policy and did so in a tone that can hardly fail to make US allies, many of whom have come to rely on and expect military and economic support from Washington, very nervous.\n\nThe president said that for too long the US has “enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military” and “defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.”\n\nHe spoke of “trillions” of dollars spent overseas to help other countries “while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.” All the while, he added, “the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country have dissipated over the horizon” and “the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Penthouse vs. the White House: Which Is Worth More?\n\nThe answer, he insisted, is a more inward-focused country:\n\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.\n\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\n\nProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down.\n\nOther than promising to pry jobs away from other countries, Trump made little reference to the world beyond US borders, with the exception of a vow to “reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump ended his remarks with a promise to “make America great again,” echoing his campaign slogan. Apparently, he plans to do it on a much smaller stage than his predecessors."

An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\n\nWe are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n\nFor many decades we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.\n\nWe've defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\n\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.\n\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.\n\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\n\nTrump’s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again. Winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\n\nWe will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\n\nWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.\n\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\n\nWe must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly, we will be protected by God.\n\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\n\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.\n\nWe all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky. They fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\n\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America! Thank you. God bless America."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/20/GOP-Governors-Voice-Alarm-About-Losing-Expanded-Medicaid",
    "text": "“Repeal and replace Obamacare” was a potent campaign slogan for the Republicans that helped make it possible for Donald Trump to claim the presidency at noon on Friday.\n\nBut as the new president and congressional Republican leaders have discovered in the aftermath of the historic Nov. 8 election, the challenge of uprooting a major federal health insurance program that covers more than 20 million Americans is a lot harder than they ever imagined.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nThe day before Trump was sworn in as the 45th president, a group of Republican governors were on Capitol Hill pleading for a sensible overhaul of the Affordable Care Act that won’t strip millions of their constituents of health care coverage, disrupt the insurance market and swamp hospital emergency rooms.\n\nGovernors from Ohio, Nevada, Idaho and even Alabama urged “a heavy dose of caution,” in meetings with congressional leaders, according to a report by Bloomberg. “We must be careful not to increase the rate of uninsured, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in a letter “Reforms must be fiscally prudent, but should maintain or improve affordable access to health care for those that are currently covered.”\n\nHerbert and eight other GOP governors were in town Thursday to confer with congressional leaders about the strategy and timing of repealing key portions of Obamacare, including taxes and subsidies, and phasing in a GOP replacement. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) have vowed to simultaneously unveil repeal and replacement legislation in the coming weeks, although it is clear the Republicans are far from a consensus on replacement legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has counseled a more deliberate pace, in which Congress first votes to repeal Obamacare, and then develops replacement legislation during an extended transition period. However, Trump is impatient to achieve both tasks simultaneously in order to make good on his campaign pledge.\n\nRelated: How Block Grants Cap Federal Costs -- and Make States the Cost-Cutting Bad Guys\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest concerns of Republican and Democratic governors alike from the 31 states receiving expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor under Obamacare is that the program will be jettisoned as part of the repeal.\n\nMany governors have complained about the Medicaid program more generally, saying that the states should be granted more leeway and flexibility in administering the program and setting eligibility requirements. However, the expanded Medicaid coverage has been a boon for many of their residents, and they don’t want to lose it in a rush to eviscerate the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Expanded Medicaid currently provides insurance for about 11 million low-income able-bodied single people across the country.\n\n“We have over 600,000 Michiganders, and we have a lot of positive data showing some good things going on in our state with this program,” Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said of the program, according to The Hill.\n\nBut Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate Majority Whip, sought to allay the Republican governors’ concern. “Nobody’s going to lose coverage,” Cornyn told reporters after meeting with the governors. “If there’s one word that came up most, it’s flexibility. One-size-fits all Washington doesn’t take into account the differences between a state like Texas with 28 million people and a state like South Dakota, for example.”"

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump raised plenty of eyebrows during the campaign by lightly dismissing the importance of the debt ceiling. He suggested that if push came to shove, he would negotiate down the debt with the country’s biggest creditors.\n\n“I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal” to pay bondholders less than the full value of the government’s obligations, the billionaire New York businessman and reality TV showman explained last spring.\n\nRelated: As the Debt Hits $20 Trillion, Has the US Reached a Tipping Point?\n\nWith the national debt fast approaching an historic $20 trillion, Trump’s cavalier attitude towards the Treasury debt management practices roiled the financial markets and Wall Street.\n\nBy mid-March, the incoming Republican administration will be faced with its first debt ceiling challenge. It will have to convince the GOP-controlled Congress to increase the Treasury’s borrowing authority beyond $20.1 trillion – to cover government expenses already incurred -- or face the first default in history.\n\nOn Thursday, former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s nominee to be the next Treasury Secretary, was grilled on Trump’s position on U.S. debt during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager quickly doused the concerns of lawmakers and his former Wall Street associates that the new president would essentially treat U.S. obligations to creditors like just another one of his real estate negotiations.\n\nRelated: Why All the Ethical Problems of Trump’s Cabinet Nominees Won’t Matter\n\nWhen Democratic Sen. Mark Warner declared that Trump must “never again question America’s willingness to stand by its debt obligations,” Mnuchin replied: “Senator, I agree with that 100 percent.”\n\nWarner, a Virginia Democrat and former telecommunications entrepreneur, said, “I have been very troubled, by even some folks in elected office who have somehow said we can ignore the debt ceiling without consequences.”\n\n“There are even some that are going out and saying somehow we can prioritize those debt obligations and potentially pay bondholders – many of them foreign, many of them Chinese—and ignore our obligations” to others, he added.\n\n“Absolutely,” Mnuchin said. ”I hope you all work with me so that we get that done. We already spent that money, we have the obligations, there should be no uncertainty that we are paying the bills.”\n\nRelated: Why the Debt Limit Is the Next Threat to the US Economy\n\nHistorically, raising the debt ceiling to cover U.S. obligations has been one of the most politically onerous but necessary chores for the party in power because it typically becomes a symbol of excessive or wasteful government spending.\n\nIronically, outgoing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew recently argued that it was long past time for Congress to jettison the statutory ceiling on the debt that has become a political weapon in the budget wars – and one that has brought the U.S. to the brink of default several times in recent decades.\n\nIn a new article to be published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation, Lew argues that the system originally set up to facilitate the Treasury’s borrowing has transformed into “a broken, outdated system that no longer meets our country’s needs.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/20/8-Steps-Trump-Could-Take-Day-One-Remake-Country",
    "text": "Anybody who watched more than a handful of Donald Trump’s appearances on the campaign trail got used to hearing the man who today will become the 45th president promise to do any number of things on “day one” of his term in the Oval Office. Now it’s time for him to deliver.\n\nBut first, the weekend.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Blunders on NATO and Russia Make Our European Allies Cringe\n\nAsked about his plans for the first day of his term, Trump said in an interview with The Times of London and Germany’s Bild newspaper earlier this week that he’ll be taking a couple of days off before getting down to the serious work of running the country.\n\n“Day one -- which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday, right? I mean, my day one is going to be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration,” he said.\n\nBut regardless of when he actually gets going, Trump is facing quite the to-do list, and at a luncheon for supporters Thursday, the incoming president seemed to acknowledge that he would have to take some sort of significant action today, if only as a nod to his repeated promises to hit the ground running.\n\n“We will be signing some papers that will be very meaningful tomorrow right after the speech to get the show going,” Trump told the crowd of donors and senior Republican lawmakers.\n\nRelated: Why All the Ethical Problems of Trump’s Cabinet Nominees Won’t Matter\n\nTrump was not specific about what he would do today, and his incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, was equally vague, telling reporters that the president-elect was still “working through” his options.\n\nWhile it’s anybody’s guess what Trump will actually do after he’s sworn in at noon today, here are some of the things he repeatedly promised to do on his Day One that might get immediate attention from the new president.\n\nBuild the Wall. Perhaps Trump’s single most frequent campaign promise was that he would build a “big, beautiful wall” between the United States and Mexico (and to force the Mexican government to pay for it.) A symbolic step toward starting construction of the wall is one of the more likely things to come out of a Trump White House today.\n\nStart Mass Deportations. Second only to the wall, at least early in his campaign, was Trump’s vow that he would immediately deport the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. While senior Republicans, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, have thrown cold water on the idea that Trump will be able to form a “deportation force” to start moving people across the border, it’s not out of the question that the new president could take some early steps to speed up the removal of criminal aliens.\n\nRelated: Germany, You’re Fired! How Trump Is Bringing Reality TV to US Foreign Policy\n\nOverturn Executive Orders. Trump repeatedly vowed to void executive orders signed by President Obama, sometimes suggesting he’d invalidate all of them, sometimes promising to undo just the ones he views as “unconstitutional.” It seems safe to expect that there will be at least a gesture toward rolling back his predecessor’s legacy of aggressive executive actions. A possible target, of a piece with promises to deport the undocumented and build a wall, is Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which lifted the threat of deportation from certain immigrants brought here illegally as children. Obama's order was nullified by an appeals court and left in place by the Supreme Court in a 4-4 decision last June.\n\nRepeal Obamacare. The law Trump called a “disaster” is not going away at the stroke of a pen, regardless of how much its opponents might like to see that happen. The Affordable Care Act is far too woven into the fabric of the nation’s healthcare system to be eliminated in an instant. However, given that doing away with it has been a key promise from not just Trump, but the entire Republican Party, some precursor step from Trump today directing federal agencies to prepare for a post-Obamacare world would not be a surprise.\n\nInstitute a Lobbying Ban. Trump’s repeated promises to “drain the swamp” of Washington -- personified, more often than not, by lobbyists -- was another standard on the trail. Trump said that he would take steps to shut down the revolving door between the federal government and the K Street offices of major lobbying firms. He could formalize his promise to require all his White House employees to agree to a five-year ban on lobbying after leaving they leave, and a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments. He could also request that Congress follow suit, however unlikely such a move would be.\n\nWithdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The massive trade deal, years in the making, was a constant target for Trump, who has criticized that treaty and others like it for costing America jobs. At this point, anything other than total withdrawal from the arrangement will look like a failure, so an official announcement that the US will not seek to ratify the deal could be something that comes out of the White House this afternoon.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Penthouse vs. the White House: Which Is Worth More?\n\nGo After China’s Currency. Usually mentioned by Trump in the same breath as the TPP was China, the great bogeyman of his story of American industrial decline. On the trail, he constantly hammered on the idea that Beijing is using unfair trade practices to make US products uncompetitive on the world market. A common Trump vow was that he would label China a “currency manipulator,” claiming the Chinese government takes illegitimate steps to keep the yuan’s value artificially low. Though experts say China hasn’t actually engaged in currency manipulation for several years, Trump has continued to insist that they do.\n\nGet ‘Tough’ on ISIS. Getting “tough” on the terror group ISIS was also one of Trump’s go-to promises during the campaign. From saying he would reinstate torture, target terrorists’ families, or just plain “bomb the shit out of them” stepping up the campaign against ISIS is something his supporters will expect Trump to do very early in his term. So, some sort of initial steps toward broadening the campaign against ISIS could also be on the table for this afternoon."

    "text": "It didn’t take long for President-elect Donald Trump and his senior advisers to begin backing away from Trump’s promise to provide “insurance for everybody” as part of his incoming administration’s evolving plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWithout ever explaining precisely what he had in mind, Trump told The Washington Post last weekend that he would push for something resembling universal coverage that would insure even more than the 20 million Americans who currently benefit from Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Tom Price Makes a Big Claim: People Won’t Get Shafted on Health Care\n\nTrump’s boasting that he was on the verge of unveiling a comprehensive health care plan to replace Obamacare that would offer cheaper premiums, better choices for consumers and near universal coverage caught congressional Republicans by surprise. The billionaire businessman’s boast has highly complicated their effort to devise a realistic plan that can win the support of rank and file lawmakers, the health care and insurance industries and a nervous public.\n\nEven Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services was vague during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday on how many more people would receive coverage once the Republicans fully overhaul the health care system. Price promised Americans “access” to the highest quality care and coverage possible but offered no guarantees that everyone could afford it.\n\nDuring an interview on Tuesday with Axios.com, Trump appeared to backtrack somewhat on his promise of insurance for everybody, saying that he wanted to find a “mechanism” – perhaps Medicaid block grants -- to help the poorest Americans. \"You know there are many people talking about many forms of health care where people with no money aren't covered.” Trump said. “We can't have that.”\n\nThe following day, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told CNN that he interpreted Trump’s comments to The Post to mean “making insurance affordable for everyone.”\n\nRelated: The Three-Way Battle for Obamacare Repeal\n\n“I think it means making insurance affordable for everyone, but also allowing for the kinds of reforms in Medicaid on a state by state basis that will ensure – that will make sure that we have healthcare coverage for the most vulnerable in our society,” Pence told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\nOn the surface, at least, Trump and his top advisers appear to be struggling to forge a consensus on a plan they can sell to Congress and are sending up a series of trial balloons. But a less charitable interpretation is that Trump is engaging in a classic bait-and-switch gambit, with some low-income single Americans having the most to lose from it.\n\nAfter briefly dangling a promise to deliver universal coverage to Americans, Trump has abruptly pulled it back and offered as a substitute an old GOP chestnut – a major overhaul of the nation’s Medicaid system, which was expanded to 133 percent of the poverty line under President Obama and included able-bodied people without dependent children.\n\nContrary to the Republicans’ promises of improvements and broader coverage, some analysts have warned that block granting Medicaid could have an adverse impact on some of the country’s poorest people.\n\nGOP efforts to transform Medicaid from a federal entitlement program covering all eligible low-income Americans into block grants to the states actually dates back to the Reagan administration of the 1980s. While the 50-year-old Medicaid program today is a health care lifeline for millions of children, pregnant women, the disabled and the poor, GOP leaders have long complained about runaway spending, fraud and waste.\n\nInterestingly, since Medicaid was conceived as a state-based program, states are not required to participate in the program. But there has been full participation in the core program since 1982. Like all health care programs, Medicaid is expensive, and a number of Republican governors and their legislatures have opted out of the expansion.\n\nAt a time when the federal debt is about hit $20 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office is warning the new administration and all the federal agencies that belt-tightening is prudent.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\nThe joint federal-state Medicaid program currently covers nearly 72 million Americans and spent approximately $545 billion during fiscal 2016. That’s the equivalent of more than 15 percent of all health care spending in the U.S., according to congressional figures.\n\nLeading GOP figures including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Price have long championed the idea of block grants to contain or cap future spending and to give states more authority in regulating the program and setting eligibility standards.\n\n“For too long, states have been treated like junior partners in the oversight and management of the Medicaid program – forced to go through long and cumbersome waiver processes just to make most changes to their program,” Ryan wrote in his “GOP Better Way” health care reform proposal released last summer.\n\nRyan and other Republican leaders contend that governors and state legislatures are closer to patients in their states and are better equipped to seize on opportunities to achieve savings and crack down on fraud and abuse. However, critics warn that it would likely give states sweeping new authority to tighten eligibility, cut benefits, and generally make it much harder for people to enroll.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n“Block grants are about producing federal savings by shifting costs and risks to states,” said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. “To compensate for the federal funding cuts, states either have to cover much more of their own costs by raising taxes, cutting other spending, or far more likely, taking any flexibility they’re given to institute cuts to their Medicaid programs – whether its eligibility, benefits, provider payments and the like.”\n\n“That likely means that many low-income beneficiaries who rely on the program will end up uninsured or under-insured,” he added in an interview Thursday. “It’s not about expanding coverage, it’s really about eventually having to make deep cuts.”\n\nA block grant would essentially cap federal Medicaid funding as a way of achieving major savings in the coming decade. Currently, the federal government picks up a fixed percentage of states’ Medicaid cost – on average 57 percent—and the states cover the rest. Under a block grant approach, however, states would receive a fixed amount based on a formula, with the states responsible for picking up any additional costs above the cap.\n\nThe states’ new block grant funding levels in most cases would be based on current or historical spending patterns, which on the surface seems fair. However, the program would be designed in a way to slow the rate of growth of funding in the coming years, gradually tightening the noose and forcing the states to adopt tighter eligibility rules, possibly including a work requirement.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nAccording to Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis last November, a block grant proposal contained in a House GOP budget plan for fiscal 2017 would cut federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion — or nearly 25 percent — over ten years, relative to current law. By then, federal funding for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be roughly $169 billion, or about a third less than what it would be under existing law.\n\nAnother analysis by the Urban Institute of a previous block grant proposal advanced by Ryan in 2012 projected that between 14 million and 21 million people would eventually lose their Medicaid coverage."

    "text": "If you thought Donald Trump’s foreign policy positions were politically calculated toss-offs, think again. The interview he gave The Times of London last week put the world on notice: The views Trump expressed as he campaigned last year—notably on NATO, Europe, and relations with Russia—are his views as of his inauguration today.\n\nNATO’s obsolete, Trump famously asserted during his run for the Republican nomination, and he’ll “get along well” with Russia and its president. As to Europe, that’s on one side of the ocean, America’s on the other, and America comes first.\n\nRelated: Germany Says NATO Concerned About Trump 'Obsolete' Remark\n\nThese positions are so at variance with accepted thinking in Washington that many people assumed Trump would get with the program before moving into the White House. But he has hardly budged. Trump still thinks NATO’s out of date, he told The Times and Bild, the German daily, in their joint interview. He still wants to “make some good deals with Russia,” and “the U.K. was so smart” when it voted last year to exit the European Union.\n\nLet’s be clear: Trump could make the case on all three of these issues. His error lies in making them now, making them so bluntly, and making them so… un-presidentially. In the course of a conversation, Trump has plunged Europe into a state of uncertainty that’s rare in trans–Atlantic relations, if not unprecedented. So is the smoldering disdain for a new American president Europeans now struggle to disguise.\n\nUntil last week Trump might have coasted for a time on the major questions hanging over trans–Atlantic diplomacy. Defeating ISIS, as he also told The Times, remains his highest priority on the foreign-policy side.\n\nThat focus is fine, but Trump has just traded all his leeway with the Europeans for a few characteristically crusty remarks. He now has to address, and swiftly after taking office, questions that were fated to be difficult but are now urgent, too:\n\nRelated: Trump’s ‘America First’ Crusade Is a Win with Voters: Poll\n\nRelations with Russia. How President Trump decides to shape U.S.–Russian ties will determine everything else he does across the Atlantic. And on questions such as Syria and terrorism, there is little question anymore that cooperating with Russia would be of mutual benefit.\n\nTrump has long faced strong resistance to improving relations from the Pentagon and hawkish senators such as John McCain. In the past 10 days, three of his cabinet appointees—Rex Tillerson (State), James Mattis (Defense), and Nikki Haley (his choice for U.N. ambassador) have joined the chorus against his idea of a new détente.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t go into this fight unarmed. First, his cabinet choices are perfectly aware of the ideological climate in Washington and know what they have to say to minimize opposition to their nominations. None of their testimony in the confirmation hearings necessarily holds.\n\nSecond, Europeans—and notably emerging right-wing populists such as France’s François Fillon—are weary of the prevailing animus toward Russia and support Trump’s neo-détente. In effect, Europeans are as divided about Trump as Americans are.\n\nRelated: NATO's Top Soldier Says Trump Comments Play Into Hands of Putin\n\nThird, President Putin knows an opening when he sees one, and he sees one now. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced Tuesday that Moscow is inviting the U.S. to join Russia, Iran, Turkey, the Damascus government, and an assortment of anti–Assad rebel groups in new peace talks on Syria.\n\nYes or no, Mr. President? This could be your first big foreign-policy decision, and it is certainly a test of your resolve. A day after Lavrov spoke, Russia announced that it had conducted airstrikes against ISIS jointly with Turkey for the first time. As Turkey is a longstanding U.S. ally, this vastly complicates the Pentagon’s anti–Russian position. Your thought, Mr. President?\n\nNATO. Trump’s principal complaint about Atlantic alliance is that it has ignored the threat of terrorism and remained unduly focused on advancing eastward toward Russia’s border. He’s wrong on the first point, right on the second.\n\nThe NATO command has shifted considerable attention to anti-terror activities since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Last summer it created a new intelligence post, at assistant secretary-general level, to coordinate intel-sharing on terrorism and other threats.\n\nBut this doesn’t contradict warnings by Henry Kissinger, the late George Kennan, and others that NATO’s eastward advance in the post–Cold War period is a needless provocation. When John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, asserted a few years ago that Russia was too close to NATO’s borders, Russian media ran a mile with the upside-down logic.\n\nRelated: Obama to Trump: Keep Russia Sanctions Separate From Nuclear Talks\n\nTrump’s got complications here. Ten days ago President Obama sent U.S. troops and armored brigades into Poland for the first time since NATO announced plans to toughen its eastern flank two years ago. That ups the ante considerably.\n\nAt the same time, five of the alliances 22 members, by Trump’s count, are paying their fair share of the NATO budget. This is at least partly a measure of the Continent’s attenuated enthusiasm for NATO in the post–Cold War era.\n\nEurope. There are obvious similarities between Trump and his anti–EU counterparts on the Continent. Many of them would surely agree with Trump in his interview with The Times: “You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany.”\n\nBut there’s one difference between Trump and his populist confrères in Europe: None of them is the 45th president of the United States.\n\nAgain, there’s a credible case that an unelected technocracy has undermined the EU’s legitimacy and appeal, and Trump may prove right that others could follow Britain to the exits. But he has cost himself political friends, notably Angela Merkel, in making the case openly and now.\n\nIt’s precisely the extent to which Germany leads the EU that Trump ought not to have said so. The German chancellor is the most committed Atlanticist in Europe. Now Trump takes office with a wary leader atop the EU.\n\nTrump’s all set to exacerbate subterranean rifts in trans–Atlantic ties that Obama has already worsened considerably by overplaying his hand. Maybe Trump wants a wider ocean, but he had better think it through."

In fact, one group says it intends to lock up the White House website.\n\nProtester.io, a platform created by San Francisco software engineer Juan Soberanis, is urging those who can’t make it to Washington “to oppose Trump’s presidency by visiting the Whitehouse.gov site and overloading it with too much traffic,” PCWorld says.\n\nA release published by PRNewswire on Jan. 12 and since taken down called Protester.io “an open platform for activists to create and run protests that operate similar to crowdfunding campaigns” with a specific goal. But instead of raising money in a set period of time, the object is to mount a one-time protest.\n\nRelated: Trump Raises Record Amount for His Inauguration\n\nHowever, PCWorld points out that a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack aimed at taking down WhiteHouse.gov could be illegal under federal law.\n\nSoberanis disagrees, describing his plan – having millions of people log into the White House website and keep refreshing the page -- as an act of civil disobedience no different than taking part in a march.\n\nIllegal or not, there is a certain irony to mounting a digital protest against a man who tweeted his way to the Oval Office with the alleged help of Russian hackers."

    "text": "Democrats are having a field day as one after another of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to top positions in his administration has been forced to reckon with embarrassing disclosures during their confirmation hearings.\n\nThe latest came Thursday morning, when a revised financial disclosure from Steven Mnuchin, the hedge fund manager-turned movie producer who is expected to be the next Secretary of the Treasury, revealed that he had failed to report more than $100 million in assets, including real estate holdings across the country and in Mexico. Mnuchin had also originally neglected to mention that he is on the board of directors of an investment fund in the Cayman Islands, the British territory notorious for its tax havens.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President\n\nThe revelations about Mnuchin followed on a string of others:\n\n* Tom Price, the Georgia Congressman tapped to run the Department of Health and Human Services, held stock in firms in the health care sector despite holding a position in Congress that gave him significant influence over health care firms and inside knowledge of pending congressional actions.\n\n* Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s pick to run the White House Office of Management and Budget, admitted that he failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes related to a household employee.\n\n* Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, admitted that one of his many housekeepers turned out to be an undocumented immigrant.\n\nAnd for all anyone knows, there could be more to come. Trump’s pick for Education Secretary, billionaire Betsy DeVos, hasn’t had her paperwork cleared by the Office of Government Ethics yet, something Democrats said should have delayed her hearing.\n\nAfter the Senate Finance Committee released details of Mnuchin’s omissions Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement, “Never before has the Senate considered such an ethically challenged slate of nominees for key cabinet positions. Mr. Mnuchin’s failure to disclose his Cayman Islands holdings just reeks of the swamp that the president-elect promised to drain on the campaign trail.”\n\nRelated: Trump Is Barking Up the Wrong Tree When It Comes to Saving American Jobs\n\nSchumer was referring to Trump’s campaign trail promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington, a place he consistently described as corrupt and venal.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats remember very well how Republicans treated Democratic nominees with problems similar to those facing Trump’s. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle was denied the position of HHS secretary after it came out that he had failed to pay taxes on some of his income. Two of President Bill Clinton’s nominees for Attorney General, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, were forced to withdraw their names from consideration after it was revealed that they had hired undocumented child care workers.\n\nSchumer called for what he described as equal treatment for Trump nominees, although in doing so he appeared to conflate Daschle’s failure to pay income tax with Baird and Wood’s nanny problems.\n\n“Senator Tom Daschle did the same thing and Republicans insisted that that disqualified him from becoming HHS secretary. We say to our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. If Tom Daschle couldn’t become a cabinet member for not paying taxes for a household employee, the same standard ought to apply to Mick Mulvaney.”\n\nBut no matter how exercised Schumer and his fellow Democrats get about Trump’s nominees ethics headaches, in the end they probably won’t make much difference.\n\nRelated: Treasury Secretary Lew Warns Trump Against Waging a Trade War\n\nIronically, the Trump nominee facing the toughest road to confirmation, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, is in trouble not because of his financial disclosures, which the OGE called “a sterling model for what we’d like to see with other nominees,” but because of his perceived closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere are two major reasons why Trump’s cabinet nominees are likely to skate through the Senate approval process.\n\nThe first is purely procedural, and the Democrats have nobody to blame for it but themselves. The decision to do away with the minority’s ability to filibuster cabinet appointees, adopted by the Democratic Senate in 2014, means that the Republicans can approve all of Trump’s picks with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe second is the context in which their hearings are being conducted. On Friday, the nation will inaugurate a man as president who has broken so many precedents and norms when it comes to financial disclosure that things like Mulvaney’s unpaid payroll taxes look trivial.\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns, as all presidents have done for 40 years, or to report the names of the banks, companies or individuals to whom he is in debt. Estimates of that debt run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and some is believed to be held by foreign banks.\n\nOn top of that, Trump’s continued ownership of his business -- both real estate holdings and the Trump brand -- set up a vast array of conflicts of interest that ethics experts from both the Republican and Democratic parties have declared both serious and unprecedented.\n\nShort of proving outright fraud or corruption on the part of one of Trump’s nominees, Democrats are simply going to find it difficult to stir up any great degree of outrage about the relatively minor transgressions of Trump’s cabinet members."

    "text": "The incoming commander-in-chief has jawboned Boeing over the cost of building a next-generation Air Force One and trash-talked the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. But that hasn’t stopped defense stocks from soaring as the new administration prepares to take office.\n\nRelated: Trump Blows the Whistle on Boeing’s $3.2 Billion Air Force One Contract\n\nSince the beginning of October and through early January, America’s “51 largest publicly traded defense and aerospace contractors saw their collective market share increase by $49 billion, up 11 percent overall,” according to analysis by the Washington Business Journal. The biggest gainers include Atec, up 47 percent, Mechanical Technology, up 45 percent, and CPI Aerostructures, up 36 percent.\n\nThe largest contractor, Boeing, with a market cap of $97.7 billion, closed at $158.32 a share on Wednesday. That is a gain of more than 16 dollars a share since Election Day – and even after president-elect Donald Trump criticized the multibillion-dollar price tag on new presidential planes Boeing is building.\n\nOn Tuesday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg conferred with the president-elect at Trump Tower – his second meeting -- and emerged saying that he had an \"excellent conversation\" with Trump that could lead to a deal \"in the very near term,\" Reuters reported.\n\nLockheed Martin, however, hasn’t fared as well as other aerospace and defense contractors: It closed at $254.07 Wednesday, up just 61 cents since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. But Trump had especially harsh words for the company, tweeting in early December: “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” And the head of BAE Systems, which is involved in the F-35 program, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this week that Trump wants a 10 percent reduction in costs.\n\nLockheed Martin is responding to Trump’s pronouncements. On Jan. 13, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said after talking with Trump for a second time that the company was close to a new contract that would cut the cost of the F-35 program and create new jobs, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nRelated: Day of the Generals: Trump’s Tilt Toward the Military\n\nBeyond the apparent willingness of both defense companies and the incoming administration to work together, investors in defense stocks may be buoyed by Trump’s appointment of so many former military officers to his administration, including National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the former general whose consulting firm had deep ties to defense contractors.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest factors driving the run-up are Trump’s campaign promises to rebuild American military might and his pledge to eliminate the defense “sequester” – automatic caps on spending put into place in 2011.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain referred to that pledge last weekend as he released a proposed $640 billion defense budget for fiscal 2018 – some $54 billion higher than what had been put forward by outgoing President Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to The Hill, McCain’s proposal “combined with a projected $60 billion for a war fund known as the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account” would jack the defense budget up to a total of about $700 billion."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/19/10-States-Worst-Medicare-Waste",
    "text": "Despite stepped up efforts to crack down on Medicare fraud and wasteful spending, the federal government lost at least $43 billion in fiscal 2015 to health care providers who filed improper or bogus claims to the program, according to a new study.\n\nNine states and the District of Columbia were responsible for the lion’s share of the total improper payments, according to a new study by the Council for Medicare Integrity, a non-profit government watchdog. The states include Texas with $50.2 million in improper payments, California with $47.8 million, New Jersey with $22.6 million and Pennsylvania $22.1 with million.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\nWhile the nation’s capital incurred the smallest Medicare losses – some $2.4 million -- it nonetheless topped the list of states in terms of “waste per Medicare beneficiary,” according to the analysis. That means that the District lost $30.90 for every one of its 76,076 residents enrolled in the federal health program for the elderly.\n\nThis is the second consecutive year that the District of Columbia has topped all states in Medicare waste per beneficiary. In reviewing federal data, the Council for Medicare Integrity concluded that D.C. wasted more than double the amount per beneficiary than the lowest-ranked state of Arkansas.\n\nOther states topping the list of Medicare waste per capita include Delaware ($22.55 per beneficiary), Texas ($20.62), New Jersey ($18.09), Oklahoma ($17.80) and Connecticut ($17.17). The amount of Medicare overpayments per state was gleaned from the recently released Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report, Recovery Auditing in Medicare for Fiscal Year 2015. CMS has also provided data regarding the number of Medicare beneficiaries in each state.\n\nSource: Council for Medicare Integrity, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nMedicare overpayments are generally made when a doctor or other health care provider submits an inaccurate bill to Medicare for services provided to a patient, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Medicare program. Typically the providers bill to a code that pays out at a higher rate than what is permissible.\n\nRelated: Doctors and Nurses Charged in Massive $900 Million Medicare Fraud\n\n“Medicare loses more money to improper payments than any other program government wide,” Kristin Walter, a spokesperson for the Council for Medicare Integrity, said in a statement Wednesday. “These improper payments are causing Medicare to hemorrhage billions of dollars desperately needed to help sustain the program.”\n\nThe Medicare Trustees have projected that funding for Medicare hospital care will begin to run out by 2028, absent government intervention and curtailment of wasteful or fraudulent payments. “It’s more important than ever that everyone become aware of this problem and that work is done to drastically reduce improper payments in Medicare to sustain the program for those who will need it in the future,” Walter said.\n\nWhile the $43 billion in Medicare overpayments in 2015 is substantial, it is probably just the tip of the iceberg. The Council for Medicare Integrity study was limited to overpayments identified by the federal Recovery Audit Contractor Program (RAC), which reviews just a fraction of the claims of Medicare Part A and B providers.\n\nDuring his second term, President Obama made cracking down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud a high priority, as federal and state law enforcement agencies launched a series of high-profile arrests and prosecutions.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 B of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nLast summer the administration touted a breakthrough in combating rampant fraud in the two health care program. The administration informed Congress that it had prevented $42 billion of improper payments to medical providers in fiscal 2013 and 2014 by using “big data” predictive analytics and other sophisticated detection methods."

    "text": "Billionaire Donald Trump’s new residence at the White House will be a significant upgrade to his New York penthouse, at least in terms in financial value, according to a new report.\n\nZillow estimates that the White House is worth $397.9 million, almost four times as much as the president-elect’s gilded penthouse in Trump Tower, valued at $100 million.\n\nRelated: The 9 Hottest Housing Markets Heading in 2017\n\nThe 55,000-square-foot White House sits on 18 acres and has 132 rooms and 32 bathrooms. It also features basketball and tennis courts, a sunroom and a library. Zillow estimates that the monthly mortgage payment on a standard 30-year home loan would be $1.6 million.\n\nBy contrast, Trump’s penthouse is located on New York’s famed Fifth Avenue and shares the same city block as luxury stores Tiffany & Co. and Gucci, with Prada and Bulgari just across the street. Designed by the late Angelo Donghia, the three-story apartment on the 58th floor is decorated with 24-karat gold and marble features reminiscent of Versailles. It also has an elevator that takes Trump directly to his office on the 26th floor. The monthly mortgage payment would be almost $415,000 on a standard 30-year fixed home loan.\n\nTrump reportedly owns about 40 other apartments in New York, many in his buildings Trump Parc at 106 Central Park South and Trump Park Avenue. In 2015, he sold the 24th-floor penthouse at Trump Park Avenue for $21 million.\n\nThe value of his New York apartment properties decreased over the last year as the city’s luxury residential market cooled down, according to a recent Forbes report.\n\nRelated: 10 Tiny but Luxurious Homes\n\nThe White House has appreciated 15 percent since President Obama took office eight years ago.

    "text": "Sometimes, the saying goes, you can’t tell the players in a game without a scorecard. What happens when you get the scorecard before you know what teams will take the field in a few weeks for a game played almost two years ago?\n\nThat’s what happened this week when the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the effects a repeal of Obamacare will have on the economy, the budget, and Americans seeking health insurance coverage.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nThe report got a significant amount of media attention this week. As Rob Garver reported here on Tuesday, the CBO estimated that passage of HR3762, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, would increase the uninsured by 18 million in its first year, then 32 million by the tenth year of its enactment. The report also estimated that the elimination of mandates would accelerate the already existing trend toward a so-called “death spiral” within individual insurance markets as underwriters would have an even higher trend toward high-utilization clients than they do now.\n\nThis analysis is, however, largely irrelevant. The new CBO report is an update of an earlier analysis it performed on legislation from nearly two years ago. Republicans pushed HR3762 in 2015 as a vehicle to force President Barack Obama into a veto of a repeal of Obamacare. The sponsors wrote the bill with caution about the consensus limits to the process of budget reconciliation, the only method available for avoiding a filibuster in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans plan to repeal most of the rest of Obamacare (except perhaps the Medicare reforms) through other means. There is still significant strategizing as to whether they can repeal more through budget reconciliation than first assumed when writing HR3762 as well.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nCharles Blahous, a former deputy director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush and a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare from 2010-15, points out the errors in taking the CBO’s report on HR3762 seriously as the totality of Obamacare repeal. The CBO scored only “the parts moving through the budget reconciliation process,” which alone would be “problematic in the ways CBO has identified.”\n\nThe initial reports gloss over the fact that even the CBO recognized that adding two other pieces to the repeal – the insurance coverage mandates and community rating requirements – would result in innovation that would add between six and nine million people to the ranks of the insured, and that premiums would be “substantially lower” than presently under full repeal.\n\nBlahous writes that the CBO’s analysis strengthens recent Republican arguments that reconciliation can be used for a full repeal, rather than the HR3762 approach. Those impacts “would have substantial effects on the federal budget,” he notes, “and could well strengthen a tactical argument that repealing these regulatory components of the ACA should also be considered germane for budget reconciliation purposes.”\n\nRelated: Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?\n\nWhy did CBO score an old bill that only covered part of the process, rather than wait a few weeks to see what Republicans plan to offer? The CBO report states that it was “prepared at the request of the Senate Minority Leader, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance, and the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.” All four are Senate Democrats, led my Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), an adamant opponent of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. The report gives opponents of the incoming administration some significant talking points about legislation that has long since expired but still has usefulness in driving public opinion.\n\nPerhaps Schumer and his Senate allies should have made their argument before the 2016 election, using the previous scoring on partial Obamacare repeal. Oh, wait – they did, and they did in the 2014 midterms as well. Voters delivered their verdict on Obamacare, one of the most discussed policies in both elections, and Democrats lost both times. Reaching back to 2015 for data on an approach that is at best incomplete and at worst expired may give them some talking points, but it won’t make voters love Obamacare or turn their back on their clear decision to replace it with policies that allow for innovation, proper risk management, and economic growth.\n\nThe big question will be whether Republicans led by Donald Trump and Paul Ryan can deliver that kind of replacement. The jury may still be out on that, and the details of both repeal and replacement may still be in negotiation. Perhaps we should wait on scoring those outcomes until we see what options Republicans produce, and take our time in analyzing them. Had we done that seven years ago rather than rush a three-thousand-page bill through Congress and trust that we would know what was in the bill after it passed, perhaps we could have avoided much of the damage that has occurred since the passage of Obamacare."

    "text": "The headlines out of Wednesday’s Senate confirmation hearings on President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services were two-fold:\n\nOne was that Trump would make good on his repeated campaign pledge not to cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security in restructuring the government health care system. The other was that for all the confusion surrounding the GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the 20 million or so Americans currently enrolled in Obamacare or expanded Medicaid won’t get shafted.\n\nRelated: The Three-Way Battle for Obamacare Repeal\n\n“One of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody is interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,” Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s nominee to become the next secretary of HHS and help orchestrate the dismantling of Obamacare, said during a four-hour hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\n“We believe that it’s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move hopefully to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage they want for themselves and their families,” he added.\n\nQuestioned by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) about Trump’s intentions to keep his campaign promises to safeguard Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, Price said that while he hasn’t had extensive discussions with Trump about those comments, “I have no reason to believe that he has changed his position.”\n\n“So you are telling us that to the best of your knowledge, Mr. Trump will not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,” Sanders persisted. “As I say, I have no reason to believe that position has changed,” Price replied.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\nPrice, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon from suburban Atlanta and a Tea Party Republican, had his work cut out for him in trying to calm the growing unease within his own party over the perilous effort to topple Obamacare without triggering chaos in the insurance market and health care industry and angering millions of Americans threatened with the loss of their coverage.\n\nTrump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) have boldly predicted that Congress would swiftly and simultaneously approve the repeal of key provisions of Obamacare and adopt a comprehensive replacement plan that would guarantee Americans less expensive premiums and copayments and greater choices of coverage. What’s more, Trump promised in an interview with The Washington Post last weekend to extend health care insurance to “everybody,” and not just the 90 percent or so of non-retired Americans who currently are covered by Obamacare, Medicaid or employer-provided healthcare.\n\nBut if the Republicans get it wrong or fail to successfully choreograph their efforts, 18 million people could lose their insurance within a year and see their premiums skyrocket even more than now, according to a report released Tuesday by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe CBO report was a bombshell of sorts, rattling the nerves of more moderate Republicans such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, while providing the Democrats with additional fodder in making their case that the Republicans are recklessly leading the country down a dangerous path without a realistic plan or roadmap in hand.\n\nPrice was sent into today’s hearing by the Trump camp both to calm the political waters and defend himself against mounting Democratic criticism that he engaged in insider trading as a House member by buying stock in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he introduced or voted for. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Price had traded stock worth more than $300,000 over the past four years, including shares in at least two companies that were directly affected by his legislative action as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nAn array of influential GOP figures, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the HELP Committee Chair, and Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch of Utah, did their best to defend Price from sharp attacks from Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington State, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Al Franken of Minnesota who all raised concerns that Price violated federal ethics rules in his stock transactions.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nHatch, whose committee will hold hearings on Price next, gushed that “Over the years I have found [Price] always to be very, very knowledgeable, very upfront, very straight forward, very honest and somebody who really understands health care systems in this country.\n\n“You are just perfectly situated to be able to help turn it around so that it works,” Hatch told the nominee.\n\nBut Franken and other Democrats argued just the opposite – that Price, a long-time foe of Obamacare who has drafted replacement legislation that almost certainly would sharply reduce the number of people qualified for coverage, is absolutely the wrong person to lead HHS.\n\n“I am very frightened by what you are going to do, and so are millions of Americans,” Franken said. “I see you as someone who is there for the doctor and that this is not going to create access for all Americans. This is going to unravel something that has given a lot of Americans peace of mind.”\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nDuring the hearing, Murkowski betrayed her uncertainty about the likely impact of the Obamacare repeal effort, especially the potential loss of expanded Medicaid coverage for her state’s Indian population. Even Alexander voiced qualms about the uncertainty over how Trump and the Republicans would sequence the move from Obamacare to his party’s alternative plan.\n\n“To me . . . Obamacare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place to give Americans access to truly affordable health care,” Alexander said in his opening remarks. “The American people deserve health care reform that is done the right way, for the right reasons and the right amount of time. It’s not about developing a quick fix. It’s about working towards long-term solutions that work for everyone.”"

    "text": "Until recently, the mortgage interest deduction was right up there with Social Security as a sacrosanct institution on Capitol Hill, protected by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Backed by the powerful National Association of Realtors and supported broadly by middle-class homeowners, previous efforts to dismantle the mortgage deduction have gone nowhere.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\nHowever, the Better Way tax-reform “blueprint” from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan would essentially get rid of the mortgage interest deduction, without policymakers having to vote to eliminate it. The plan would make the standard deduction far more valuable -- increasing it from $12,600 to $24,000 for a married couple. This would result in far fewer people itemizing their taxes, which is necessary in order to claim the mortgage tax deduction. (President-elect Donald Trump’s tax plan calls for raising the deduction even higher, to $30,000 for joint filers.)\n\nUnder the House Republicans’ plan, an estimated 38 million of the 45 million filers (or 84 percent) who currently itemize would opt instead for the standard deduction, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. The GOP proposal states that “far fewer taxpayers will choose to itemize deductions, with the vast majority of taxpayers finding they are better off by taking advantage of the larger, simpler standard deduction instead.”\n\nUnder current rules, taxpayers can itemize and deduct the interest paid on up to $1 million on a mortgage, and home equity debt of up to $100,000. The mortgage interest deduction is the third-most expensive subsidy in the tax code, costing the federal government about $70 billion per year, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nEven with Republican control of the House, Senate and the White House, the Republican tax plan is nowhere near a done deal. Nearly three-quarters of Americans recently polled by the National Association of Home Builders say that they support the government providing tax incentives that encourage homeownership, and lobbyists for the real estate and construction industries are already gearing up to fight the provision.\n\nRelated: Companies That May Not Make It Through 2017\n\nIf the blueprint were to become law, it would have ramifications for millions of taxpayers, homeowners and sellers, but the overall impact on the housing market (and your wallet) may be smaller than you think.

Home values could fall in the short-term.\n\nThe total elimination of the mortgage interest deduction might push prices down around 7 percent, according a recent paper from the Federal Reserve. The impact might be smaller if the deduction is not fully repealed. That’s a relatively small decrease compared to the double-digit decline seen after the housing bubble burst in 2006, but it would mean a paper loss of nearly $17,000 on the average $240,000 home. Still, the impact of increasing the standard deduction, rather than eliminating the mortgage-interest deduction, would likely have a smaller impact.\n\n2. But only a small portion of taxpayers uses the mortgage-interest deduction.\n\nWhile it enjoys broad support, the vast majority of homeowners don’t benefit from the mortgage interest deduction as it currently stands. The benefit is only available to those who have a mortgage on their home and who itemize their taxes.\n\nOnly about 20 percent of taxpayers currently claim the deduction, and it has an average benefit of just over $2,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. “You go to [mid-tier markets] like Texas, Florida, and Arizona, and no one talks about buying a home to save on taxes,” says John Burns of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which provides data and advice to real estate investor. “It’s not even part of the equation anymore.”\n\n3. Most consumers would still be better off buying.\n\nIt’s cheaper to buy than to rent a home in most parts of the country, and that wouldn’t change with the elimination of the mortgage deduction. “This doesn’t fundamentally affect the rent-versus-buy decision,” says Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLoughlin. “It makes it less of a better deal to buy than to rent, but buying still remains a good financial option if a household can stay in their home for seven years.”\n\nA calculation by Politico finds that a homeowner with a $65,000 annual salary would see the tax benefits of buying a $263,000 condo plummet from $3,325 a year to $166. Tying up your assets and losing the ability to easily relocate may not be worth that much, although there are other benefits of homeownership, such as growing equity and protection from rising rents, and there are many emotional incentives that compel people to become home owners.\n\n4. Middle-income homeowners would feel the biggest bite.\n\nAny impact on home prices would likely be concentrated on more moderately priced homes, where the owners aren’t paying enough in interest to outweigh taking the new deduction but aren’t in a high enough tax bracket to get a huge break. The Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-income taxpayers would see an average tax cut of only $260 per year under the Republican plan. That’s hardly enough to offset even a modest loss in home equity, although long-term demand would likely see prices bounce back over time.\n\n5. High-income homeowners would benefit.\n\nThe wealthiest homeowners would benefit from both the tax cut and continued access to the mortgage-interest deduction, since they’d likely continue to itemize. Those making more than $1 million a year typically save nearly $9,000 thanks to the deduction. Under the Republic tax plan, the top quintile of taxpayers would also receive an average tax cut of $11,000 a year.\n\nDue to larger mortgages and a higher tax rate, wealthy borrowers already benefit disproportionately from the mortgage interest deductions, which wouldn’t change. Wealthy taxpayers often choose to finance the purchase of a home even though they could pay cash, as part of a broader tax planning strategy."

    "text": "There’s a natural human tendency to try to impose order on unfamiliar situations, and for better or worse, we often use frameworks that have worked for us in the past. Military leaders tend to use their past battlefield experiences to guide current decision making, though not always with the best results. Business leaders sometimes assume that strategies that worked in one industry or company will succeed in another -- even though they often don’t.\n\nSo it may cause a little alarm in the foreign policy community that President-elect Donald Trump appears to be organizing his approach to the United States’ relations with other countries in a frame familiar to him: the reality television show.\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\nTrump enjoyed a long and successful run as the star of The Apprentice television franchise, in which a group of hopefuls were assembled and, each starting with a clean slate, had to compete to earn Trump’s favor.\n\nCompare that set-up to how Trump described his approach to foreign policy in an interview with the new news website Axios this week:\n\nTrump earlier this week unsettled allies overseas by calling NATO obsolete and seeming to put Germany's Angela Merkel and Russia’s Vladimir Putin on par as possible US allies. Trump told us ALL WORLD LEADERS are on par, with a fresh chance to prove themselves. “So, I give everybody an even start; that right now, as far as I'm concerned, everybody's got an even start,” he said.\n\nThat will, no doubt, come as surprising and unwelcome news to some of the United States’ closest allies, including the UK, France and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These are countries that have time and again sacrificed blood and treasure in places like Afghanistan and Iraq in support of U.S.-led military actions. Asking the county’s oldest friends to “prove themselves” to the incoming president is at best superfluous and at worst egregiously insulting.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. the Dollar: Why Investors Are Right to Be Nervous\n\nHis assessment of the threats facing the U.S. on the global stage was no more encouraging. “I’ve had a lot of briefings that are very … I don't want to say ‘scary,’ because I'll solve the problems. But … we have some big enemies out there in this country and we have some very big enemies — very big and, in some cases, strong enemies.”\n\nIt wasn’t the only eyebrow-raising moment in Trump’s Axios interview.\n\nThe president-elect appeared to backtrack on his statement from earlier in the week that his aim in creating a replacement for the Affordable Care Act would be to provide “insurance for everybody.” Though he has said that his plan is nearly complete and will be released to the public soon, the best he offered was, “You know there are many people talking about many forms of health care where people with no money aren't covered. We can't have that,” he said.\n\nHe also appeared to reverse course on his previous statement that a border-adjusted tax was too complicated and shouldn’t be part of an emerging Republican plan to overhaul the federal tax code. His statement had confused GOP lawmakers, who had been told by Trump’s advisers that the president was in favor of the plan. In the Axios interview, he said that the border adjustment was back on the table.\n\nIt’s enough to bring a very different television show to mind: The Twilight Zone."

    "text": "As Republican President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office armed with plans for major tax cuts, infrastructure construction and a major military buildup, a new report by the Government Accountability Office warns that the government must come to grips with a looming fiscal crisis that is driving the national debt towards a record $20 trillion.\n\nThe new report issued Tuesday acknowledges that the incoming administration faces serious economic, national security and social challenges that will necessitate new spending.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\n“At the same time, the federal government is highly leveraged in debt by historical norms,” the GAO said in a comprehensive report on the state of government finances. “In addition to near term financing decisions, a broader plan is needed to put the government on a more sustainable long-term path.”\n\n“Federal spending continues to outpace revenue – by $587 billion in 2016 – and absent policy changes, the structural gap between revenues and spending puts the federal government on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path,” the GAO stated.\n\nThe report, a consolidation of federal financial studies and audits, argues that the surge in deficit spending last year should be a wake-up call for government leaders and policy makers. Last August, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the fiscal 2016 budget deficit would increase in relation to gross domestic product for the first time since 2009 and would continue to rise for the coming decade.\n\nWith government spending outpacing revenues throughout the year, the fiscal 2016 deficit totaled nearly $587 billion, or about $148 billion more than the previous year’s shortfall. Without major changes in policy, such as Congress approving higher taxes or reforms to Social Security, Medicare and other major entitlements, the deficit is projected to grow considerably in the coming decade as a share of the overall economy.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nPublicly held debt rose as a share of the overall economy from 74 percent at the end of fiscal 2015 to 77 percent at the end of fiscal 2016, compared to an average of 44 percent of gross domestic product over the past 70 years. The U.S. gross national debt -- the sum total of all borrowing and internal governmental obligations -- currently stands at $19.96 trillion and is on track to breach $20 trillion in the coming month.\n\n“The longer action is delayed, the greater and more drastic the changes will have to be,” the GAO said in its report, echoing previous warnings from GAO, CBO and other government spending auditors. Absent a significant change in course, the debt-to-GDP ratio will surpass its historic high of 106 percent within 15 to 25 years.\n\nThe GAO report indicates that long-term shortfalls in the Medicare Hospital Insurance and Social Security trust funds “add to the importance of beginning action.” Medicare and Social Security will begin to spend more than they take in by the end of the decade, according to the most recent report of the trustees.\n\nLong-term insolvency of these and other entitlement programs are problems that Congress and the incoming Trump administration will have to address. A showdown over entitlement reform could come sooner than later as Trump and congressional Republican leaders have begun pressing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe GAO report urged Congress and the new administration to consider new innovations in managing the country’s long-term debt beyond existing statutory discretionary spending caps. “GAO has suggested Congress consider alternative approaches that would better link decisions about borrowing to finance the debt with decisions about spending and revenue at the time those decisions are made.”\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nWhat’s more, the report said, executive actions alone cannot put the U.S. government on a sustainable fiscal path, and that it is important that departments and agencies “act as stewards of federal resources.\n\nThe GAO report reiterated a series of steps that federal agencies could take to help address the government’s long term fiscal problems, including the following:\n\nReduce improper payments. The government for decades has struggled to reduce overpayments in Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs as well as in major contracting. Since fiscal 2003, cumulative estimates of overpayments have totaled over $1.2 trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress the persistent tax gap. The report notes that beyond the problem of the structural mismatch between spending and tax revenues, with more money going out than coming in, the IRS and other agencies could do a much better job of collecting what is owed the government. The annual gross tax gap is estimated to be $458 billion.\n\n\n\n"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/18/Why-Does-Trump-Favor-Weak-Dollar-and-Good-or-Bad-America",
    "text": "Just days before taking office, President-elect Donald Trump roiled international currency markets, telling The Wall Street Journal that the US dollar is “too strong” compared to other global currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan.\n\n“Our companies can’t compete with them now because our currency is too strong,” Trump said. “And it’s killing us.” His comments were followed by a 1.3 percent drop in the value of the dollar against a basket of global currencies in trading on Tuesday, to its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. the Dollar: Why Investors Are Right to Be Nervous\n\nTrump’s willingness to talk down the value of the dollar is a notable departure from decades of “strong dollar” rhetoric from administrations of both Republican and Democratic presidents going back to the mid-1990s. With few exceptions (notably, former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neil, who not coincidentally came from a manufacturing background) U.S. officials have consistently said that the preference among US policymakers is for a strong dollar.\n\nBut the trade-offs inherent in a strong-dollar policy aren’t always obvious, and more importantly, the ability of the president to materially affect the value of the dollar without taking active steps to manipulate the currency are unclear. Some key questions:\n\nWhat’s the benefit of a strong dollar?\n\nA strong dollar has a number of positive impacts on the economy, the most obvious of which is that it makes imported goods more affordable for American consumers. It also makes investing in the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies and investment funds. If the assumption is that the dollar will continue to appreciate against foreign currencies -- or at least can be expected not to lose value relative to them -- it is naturally a more attractive currency to hold.\n\nThe strong dollar also keeps the Treasury Department’s borrowing costs low, meaning that when the US borrows more money or rolls over existing debt, less federal spending is dedicated to interest payments than would be under a weak dollar scenario. Those lower interest rates extend to consumers as well, who benefit from cheaper mortgages and other loans.\n\nRelated: Why the Political Mainstream Keeps Failing America’s Workers\n\nWhat’s the harm of a strong dollar?\n\nThe trouble with a strong dollar gets to the heart of Trump’s promise to pump up the volume of American exports: it makes goods and services produced in the U.S. more expensive relative to those produced in other countries. Every time the euro, yen, yuan, or ruble gains against the dollar, relative prices of U.S. exports go down, making them more competitive globally.\n\nOn its face, this is good for the United States in that, theoretically, at least, it leads to more jobs in the manufacturing sector and in service sectors that sell to foreign clients.\n\nWhat have US policymakers done in the past to keep the dollar strong?\n\nThe short answer: Not much. The strong dollar policy has largely been a rhetorical stance for decades, with little direct action to back it up. The US dollar floats freely in the currency markets, and as a rule, the federal government doesn’t act directly to influence its value vis-a-vis other global currencies. (In fact, on the campaign trail, Trump frequently railed against China for being a “currency manipulator” -- that is, for taking active measures to keep the yuan, and therefore Chinese exports, cheap.)\n\nThere was a brief episode in 2011 when central banks from various countries acted in concert to stabilize currency markets in the wake of a disastrous earthquake in Japan, but in recent years that sort of thing has been the exception rather than the rule.\n\nRelated: The Government Marks 20 Years of Failure to Balance Its Books\n\nIn fact, some would argue that US monetary policy, as implemented by the Federal Reserve, has revealed a de facto weak dollar preference by keeping interest rates at rock bottom in an effort to spur some degree of inflation. The strength of the dollar has persisted in spite of the Fed’s extremely accommodative stance on monetary policy for various reasons, including the global perception of the US economy as a safe haven in times of global uncertainty.\n\nWhat can Trump do to weaken the dollar?\n\nAs an example, Trump’s Treasury Department could try to weaken the dollar by buying up other currencies to drive up their prices relative to the greenback. However, the US is party to international agreements against unilateral currency manipulation.\n\nFurther, it’s unclear any such policy would be effective in a market as massive as the one that exists for the US dollar internationally. Some $5 trillion in dollar trades take place every single day in foreign exchange markets, the vast majority well beyond the control of the federal government, meaning that it could be difficult for unilateral action by the Treasury Department to move the needle.\n\nOne avenue open to Trump is to follow through on his threat to impose protectionist trade restrictions meant to boost US exports at the cost of foreign manufacturers. However, that’s dangerous territory, not only because it invites instability in the markets, but also because it could spark retaliatory action from trading partners that could easily spiral out of anyone’s control."

    "text": "On his way out the door, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday warned the incoming Trump administration of the high global risks of launching a trade war against China, Mexico and other economic rivals with an aggressive tariff policy.\n\nRepublican President-elect Donald Trump has been rattling China’s cage for months, complaining about that country’s alleged currency manipulation that hurts U.S. exports and helped produce a U.S. trade deficit of $45.2 billion late last year. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs as high as 45 percent on imported goods from China and Mexico unless those countries discontinue trade practices that Trump claims have cost millions of jobs in this country.\n\nRelated: How China Can Fight Trump's Trade Policies\n\nIn what amounted to his farewell address before Trump is sworn in on Friday, the outgoing Democratic Treasury Secretary said that a ramp-up in tariffs and other protectionist measures would invariably slow economic growth throughout the world. The International Monetary Fund on Monday issued its latest World Economic Outlook forecasts projecting global growth at 3.4 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018, projected rates unchanged from October’s report.\n\nLew also said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” that free trade is essential both to the U.S. economy and helping to foster a more peaceful world – if that’s possible.\n\n“If we were to see, around the world, a proliferation of new barriers, what we'd see is a lessening, a slowing down, of global growth,” Lew said, according to The Hill.\n\nLew, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations, warned of the dangers of jettisoning free trade negotiations and tearing up long-standing trade agreements. He noted that President Obama had insisted over the years on extracting high labor and environmental standards in other countries as part of any trade deal.\n\nRelated: A New Risk for US Businesses: Being Called Out by Trump\n\n\"That's the way to approach trade, not by just erecting barriers, either tariff or non-tariff barriers,\" Lew said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping used an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday to vigorously defend free trade and stress Beijing’s desire to play a more prominent global role, according to Reuters.\n\nXi said during the gathering of political leaders, including Vice President Joe Biden, corporate CEOs and bankers, that it is highly risky for a country to blindly pursue its national interest ahead of all other concerns, in an apparent reference to Trump’s “America First” creed.\n\nThe Chinese leader compared protectionism to “locking oneself in a dark room” as a defense against danger, only to cut off “all light and air,” according to the news reports. “No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,” Xi said in a nearly hour-long speech in a massive conference hall.\n\nRelated: Why the Debt Limit Is the Next Threat to the US Economy\n\nNotably, Xi disputed Trump’s claim that Beijing has repeatedly enhanced its trade competitiveness by weakening the yuan in relationship to the U.S. dollar – something Trump has repeatedly complained about. Xi also urged the U.S. and other signatories to an historic climate change agreement reached in Paris a year ago to stand by the deal.\n\nTrump vowed during the campaign to label China a currency manipulator shortly after he took office as president. However, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last Friday, the President-elect said that he wouldn’t take that action on his first day in office. “I would talk to them first,” he said.\n\nAs for the international climate change pact, Trump is a skeptic about global warming and has been non-committal on whether he would stand by the deal negotiated by the Obama administration or pull out of it."

It recently passed through the Taiwan Strait, which seen by some observers as a threatening message to Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nRelated: China Just Gave Trump a 999-Foot-Long Middle Finger\n\nThe Taiwanese president, of course, set off diplomatic red alerts when she phoned Donald Trump to congratulate him on being elected president – and he took the call in what Beijing considers a violation of the “One China” policy in place since 1979.\n\nBut if China’s intent was to shiver a few timbers by its display of naval might, the American military might have reason to take the warning lightly. The Navy just announced that after delays, the $13 billion supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford – the most advanced and expensive aircraft carrier every built – will be ready for delivery by April.\n\nThe Ford will be the first of a new class of carriers being built as part of a $40 billion program, and it will be one of nine new vessels the Navy is adding in 2017. They include four littoral combat ships, two destroyers and two submarines.\n\nIn its 2016 index of U.S. military strength, the conservative Heritage Foundation gave the Navy a “marginal” rating. And there was no shortage of talk in the past election year about the American military falling behind. But it’s hard to make the case that the Navy is outgunned when it comes to aircraft carriers: It currently has 10 1,000-foot Nimitz-class carrriers in service.\n\nRelated: Trump Slams U.S. Military Arms as He Swoons Over Russian Military\n\nThe Ford class ships, which are designed to accommodate the F-35 fighter jets, would be a game-changer if there was another country even in the carrier game in a meaningful way.\n\nA column in Bloomberg View early last month described Russia’s “embarrassing aircraft carrier” the Admiral Kuznetsov -- the only active one in its fleet -- as lumbering along “belching black smoke, accompanied by tugboats standing ready to tow because of frequent breakdowns.” The column by Tobin Harshaw also referred to media reports saying that plumbing problems has reduced the number of latrines to 25 for a crew of 2,000.\n\nHarshaw suggested that the Kuznetsov might be worth more as scrap metal than as a projection of Valdimir Putin’s military muscle."

    "text": "Not since Rosa Klebb attacked James Bond with exotic darts in her boots have Americans been so obsessed with evil Russians. Hillary Clinton fans blame Vladimir Putin for her defeat; President Obama warns that Russia is trying to “weaken us,” and John McCain says Moscow is out to “destroy democracy.”\n\nAt the same time, the country has been riveted by titillating materials purporting to show that Russia has the goods on Donald Trump, unnerved by reports that incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has had private conversations with the Russian ambassador, and alarmed by CIA Director John Brennan’s warnings that Trump doesn’t have a “full understanding” of Russia’s capabilities and intentions.\n\nRelated: House Intel Chief Sets up Showdown Over Allegation Russia Helped Trump\n\nWhy this reversion to Cold War anxieties? Four reasons: First, Russia has become a convenient scapegoat for Clinton’s defeat (along with Comey, and “fake news” and racism and GOP “voter suppression” and the Electoral College). Second, President Obama failed to take cyber warfare seriously for eight years even as the intrusions from Russia, China, North Korea, the Syrian Electronic Army, Iran and elsewhere became bolder and costlier, finally emerging as an unacceptable effort to sway our election. Third, Donald Trump’s assertions that Putin is smart (as he indeed is) and a strong leader (also true) have allowed critics to portray the President-elect as somehow besotted by and in league with the Russian strongman.\n\nFour, Putin is indeed evil and always has been. But, it is not Trump who has been naive about the threat from Russia. That dubious honor belongs to President Obama. In 2012 when Mitt Romney said Russia was our number one geopolitical foe, Obama mocked him saying, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.” Obama still had a lot to learn.\n\nNonetheless, Trump opponents, including some in the GOP, are piling on, hinting that his cabinet nominees have nefarious ties to Russia. A righteous Marco Rubio feigned astonishment that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, would not declare Putin a “war criminal” based on Russian attacks on Syrian civilians. Surely Florida’s junior senator knows that no responsible candidate for our top diplomatic post would take such an undiplomatic stance.\n\nRelated: Trump Is Wrong About Russia, but He Does Get One Thing Right\n\nTillerson’s transgression is that under his leadership, Exxon Mobil has acquired interests in Russia’s Arctic, the Black Sea and Western Siberia, in partnership with state-owned Rosneft, led by a close Putin ally. Given that Russia ranks eighth in proven world oil reserves, and that the country has historically relied on western technology to produce oil in challenging regions like the Arctic, it follows that Exxon would work to secure access to reserves in Russia – something that most leading oil companies have done, and that would be impossible without a local partner.\n\nWhy explore in a hostile land? In 2015 Exxon Mobil was unable to replace the oil and natural gas it produced for the first time in twenty-one years. Easy-to-access oil reserves are increasingly rare and much has been put off limits due to environmental concerns. Russia has potential. Tillerson and other industry executives have had to balance the risks of operating in a country without the rule of law against providing shareholders a diminishing asset.\n\nMake no mistake; every U.S. CEO is well aware of the dangers of operating in Russia, or any other unfriendly country. They are routinely briefed by our intelligence agencies (who also seek information gleaned by U.S. firms abroad) and in addition hire outside advisors that specialize in political information before committing shareholder funds.\n\nTo protect its interests, Exxon Mobil lobbied against various sanctions in recent years that threatened its Russian operations. That’s what companies do.\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nAt the heart of all the Sturm und, Drang about Russia is a desperate and absurd effort to undermine Donald Trump by making him out to be an ignorant and willing tool of Putin’s aggression. While the indignant New York Times has fulminated about Trump’s “embrace” of Putin, even they had to acknowledge that his nomination of James Mattis to be his Secretary of Defense points in another direction. Mattis has long been outspoken on the dangers posed by Russia, and reiterated his position during recent Senate hearings, declaring the country to be the number one threat to U.S. interests. Does The Times not think Trump knew of Mattis’ hard-headed position? That he picked his name out of a hat?\n\nLike Obama, President-elect Trump has proposed that a good working relationship with Russia would be a positive for the U.S. After all, that was what Hillary Clinton’s “reset” was supposed to achieve. Obama in effect welcomed such a partnership when he asked Putin to take over the disposal of Bashar al-Assad’s cache of chemical weapons in Syria, and just recently reiterated that ambition, saying at a press conference in Germany he hopes Trump will find “areas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align.”\n\nAt that same forum, Obama also said he hoped that his successor “would stand up to Russia.” That, of course, is what the White House failed to do. President Obama once promised that Vladimir Putin would pay for his sins by being isolated by the international community, but he then rescued Russia from that very isolation by inviting Moscow to resolve Syria’s chemical weapons issue. He also asked for Russia’s acquiescence in his legacy Iran nuke deal, allowing Putin to become the major power broker in the Middle East.\n\nRelated: A Timeline of Trump’s Flirtation With Putin and Russia\n\nThere were good reasons for Clinton to attempt a reset with Russia. We need allies in the fight against ISIS and Russia fears Islamic terrorism as much as we do. However, Putin, who like all bullies respects only strength, did not respect President Obama. The White House could have adopted a more robust playbook by accelerating natural gas exports to undermine Russia’s energy grip on Western Europe, for instance. Or we might have committed troops to the Baltic states earlier on, reinforcing our commitment to our NATO allies. Only recently has Obama allowed that show of force.\n\nThe bottom line is that our relations with Russia under Obama have been hostage to his legacy ambitions – primarily the Iran deal. This was a conflict of interest second to none presented by Trump or his incoming cabinet."

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has set a fundraising record for his inauguration on Friday, reportedly raising $100 million so far. This eclipses the previous record of $55 million set for Barack Obama’s first inauguration. Whether Trump will spend the entire amount remains to be seen.\n\nIt looks like Trump’s inaugural festivities will be somewhat muted compared to Obama’s in 2009. Trump is holding three inaugural balls, whereas Obama had 10. Trump’s inaugural planning team also wants to limit the parade to 90 minutes, compared to the more than two hours for Obama.\n\nSlideshow: Inauguration Costs for the Last 5 Presidents\n\nEach president has an inaugural committee tasked with soliciting donations to fund the galas, dinners, concerts and other activities surrounding the inauguration. A Trump spokesman told the Associated Press that any money not used for the festivities would be donated to charity. Obama used leftover money to help pay for the White House Easter egg roll and other events during his first term.\n\nInauguration are paid for by taxpayers, too. Federal, state and local governments are responsible for costs associated with extra security, which are estimated to be as much as $100 million this year. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies is paying $1.25 million for the swearing-in ceremony, inaugural luncheon and review of troops.\n\nThe cost of the festivities surrounding presidential inaugurations skyrocketed with Ronald Reagan’s first swearing-in, which was by nominal terms more than five times the cost of Jimmy Carter’s inauguration in 1977, according to the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University.\n\nThat was partly because of high inflation that occurred during Carter’s administration. Additionally, several balls were added to the festive weekend during Reagan’s first inauguration. And Carter purposefully kept his inauguration modest, with his wife wearing the same blue ball gown she had worn six years earlier to the celebration of his gubernatorial inauguration in Georgia.\n\nWoodrow Wilson also had a low-budget inauguration in 1913. He declined to hold a ball because he disliked dancing and believed it was inappropriate for the occasion. Congress ended up spending only $30,000 for the event, or about $731,400 in today’s dollars. The inaugural ball first started with James Madison's inauguration in 1809.\n\nClick here to see what recent presidents spent on celebrating their inaugurations."

    "title": "Could a Hybrid Obamacare Plan Bring the GOP and Dems Together?",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/17/Could-Hybrid-Obamacare-Plan-Bring-GOP-and-Dems-Together",
    "text": "With the political climate thoroughly poisoned by the election, and Trump, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) holding the whip hand in dictating the direction Congress will go, the prospects of any meaningful compromise on health care seems far-fetched. Yet even if the Republicans succeed in ramming through a budget resolution later this month or in early February to repeal Obamacare at some future date, Republicans will need eight or more Senate Democrats to adopt a replacement plan under Senate rules.\n\nOne idea that is gaining some attention is the Solomon-like proposal of freshman Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) to create an unusual hybrid approach. Cassidy’s approach would essentially shift major decision-making authority away from the federal government and allow the states to decide whether to stick with some version of Obamacare or opt for whatever Trump and the Republicans come up with.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nCassidy, one of a half-dozen moderate Senate Republicans who has voiced concern about their party’s increasingly perilous course on health care, first introduced “The World’s Greatest Healthcare Plan” bill a year ago in concert with Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX). It began as a bid to give patients “market-based solutions” by lowering costs, eviscerating Obamacare mandates on individuals and businesses, and returning power over insurance to the states.\n\nBut over time, the Cassidy-Sessions approach has evolved into a potential starting point for the two parties to negotiate a compromise that would somehow preserve many of the features strongly favored by Democrats and blue states while allowing the Republican majority and its allies among red states to chart a new course in national health care.\n\n“I believe that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground,” Cassidy said in a floor speech earlier this month. “My replacement plan would give states the option.”\n\n“I am willing to concede that some folks—the Minority Leader—believe that Obamacare is working just fine,” he said. “In my plan, we repeal Obamacare on a federal level, but if states like California or New York think that Obamacare works for them, then god bless them.”\n\nRelated: Rand Paul’s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning\n\nUnder Cassidy’s approach, state legislatures in Sacramento, Albany and the rest of the country could decide to take federal funding to maintain an Obamacare-style system in their own states or opt for the GOP alternative.\n\nThe legislation would repeal the federal mandates that require individuals to purchase health insurance and that require employers to provide coverage under the threat of penalties. Every American would receive a refundable tax credit that could be spent on health insurance premiums or deposited into a Health Savings Account and used to pay directly for health care services. They would also qualify for catastrophic major medical coverage and prescription drugs.\n\n“Under my replacement plan, we would also cover more Americans than Obamacare by giving states the option of enrolling the uninsured in a basic health plan unless they choose to opt out,” Cassidy explained. “This will likely lead to 95 percent enrollment or more.”\n\nThe plan calls for a two-year transition period that would give states through 2018 to decide what approach to take. By 2019, the GOP repeal and replace plan would take effect, although states that chose to stick with Obamacare could subsequently opt out.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said on Tuesday that the Cassidy-Sessions approach might offer the seeds of a compromise.\n\n“It’s a hybrid approach, and like all hybrid approaches it could be the basis for conversation,” he said. “I think that there would be substantial changes to it, but it does point in a useful direction for Republicans.\n\n“You have to recognize that many aspects of the ACA have changed the individual insurance market in a fundamental way, and some of those things you’re just not going to be rolling back.”\n\nEzra Klein, writing today in Vox, recalled that in 2006, Price and Tammy Baldwin, then a liberal Democratic House member and now a senator from Wisconsin, co-sponsored a bill to allow states to make more creative use of federal funds in providing health care to their residents.\n\nRelated: The Potential Cost of Obamacare Repeal: 32 Million Without Insurance\n\nThe bill asked that states submit health reform plans that would likely lead to “increased health coverage and access.” If a special bipartisan commission approved of a state’s proposed new approach to health care coverage, it would be submitted to Congress for final approval.\n\nThe Price-Baldwin bill, which drew a strong endorsement from the conservative Heritage Foundation, would provide states with a combination of repurposed existing federal money and new federal grants.\n\n“Here, then, is what the Trump Administration could do to replace Obamacare with something better without falling flat on their face,” Klein wrote in praising an approach similar in some ways to Cassidy’s bill. “Tell the states to do it, instead.”"

    "text": "Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) recently fretted that the Republicans’ attempt to repeal and eventually replace the Affordable Care Act was leading the GOP into a “box canyon.”\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump did little to allay Corker’s and others’ fears that they may be heading down a political blind alley by declaring over the weekend that he would shortly unveil a replacement plan that would slash premiums and co-pays, shift to a more market-oriented system, and provide “insurance for everybody.”\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\nBut Trump’s vision for overhauling the existing health care system and providing universal health insurance coverage – revealed by the GOP president-elect in an interview over the weekend with The Washington Post – is sharply at odds with the proposals advanced by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), that would offer “universal access” to Americans, but no guarantees of coverage.\n\nRyan and Price – Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – see eye to eye on a number of changes in replacing Obamacare. Those include scrapping most Obamacare mandates and taxes, replacing the current subsidies for lower income people with a refundable tax credit that would provide less premium buying power, encouraging the interstate sales of health insurance policies, and the creation of state operated high-risk pools to provide coverage to sick or elderly consumers.\n\nHowever, universal health insurance coverage – an idea aggressively promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and scores of other progressives -- would be enormously costly and is not currently on the congressional GOP policy radar screen. An estimated 20 million Americans have acquired coverage under Obamacare, and the rate of uninsured dropped to a record low of 10.9 percent in the third quarter of 2016 in contrast to 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nThe prospects of Trump ultimately achieving the goal of health care coverage for all Americans seems highly problematic, particularly since no congressional leaders are willing to raise taxes to finance the expansion. And Trump reaffirmed over the weekend that he would not cut Medicare spending to help offset the cost of a more expansive health care program.\n\nPolitico reported on Tuesday that congressional Republicans are “caught in between,” rushing to repeal Obamacare through an expedited budgetary process begun late last week, while receiving “mixed signals” from the incoming administration regarding what will replace it. What’s more, several key Republicans, including Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch of Utah, already have signaled little enthusiasm for Price’s approach.\n\n“We still don’t know exactly what they want to do,” Hatch told reporters.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, are mounting a nationwide campaign to try to salvage Obamacare. They are claiming that Trump and the Republicans are sowing chaos in the health insurance market that will lead to millions of Americans losing their coverage in the coming year or two.\n\nRelated: What Obamacare Repeal Could Mean for Your Workplace Health Plan\n\nIndeed, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation warned in a study issued on Tuesday that the number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new plan year following enactment of the Republicans’ Obamacare repeal legislation.\n\n“Later, after the elimination of the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, that number would increase to 27 million, and then to 32 million in 2026,” the report stated.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has said that neither he nor other Democrats would lift a finger to help Trump and the Republicans forge a replacement for Obamacare unless they took part in serious negotiations with the GOP to fix the worst aspects of Obamacare and to bring down premium and out-of-pocket costs."

    "text": "The post-election lull on Wall Street looks set to end.\n\nAfter all the excitement of October and November — FBI headlines, President-elect Trump's surprise win and the historic \"Make America Great Again\" market surge to new highs — stocks have gone exactly nowhere over the last five weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remains unable to break above the 20,000 level despite much cheerleading in the financial press.\n\nInvestors and traders checked out, sitting on comfortable gains as volume dwindled around the long holiday weekends. But beneath the surface, like a kraken looming in the depths, volatility and unease is reappearing. It's best seen in the reversal underway in the U.S. dollar, which soared triumphantly in the wake of Trump's victory.\n\nRelated: Blind Trust in Donald Trump Could Be Costly\n\nThe dollar's rise was one of the lynchpins of the post-election rise, fueling the weakness in emerging market stocks and currencies (on trade war and border tax fears) and building intense demand for U.S. equities. The dollar’s rise helped crush safe haven assets like gold and Treasury bonds.\n\nOver the last few weeks, trend reversals have been seen in precious metals and bonds. Gold has climbed for three consecutive weeks to top the $1,200-an-ounce level for the first time since November. Treasury bonds as represented by the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) have also hit multi-week highs as the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen from 2.6 percent to 2.4 percent.\n\nSuddenly, there is an interest in safety again.\n\nNow, it's the dollar's turn: On Friday, the greenback closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since September. That drop continued on Tuesday after Trump told The Wall Street Journal that the dollar is “too strong.”\n\n^DXY data by YCharts\n\nThere are other reasons to questions the recent surge, too, including the fact that Trump's fiscal stimulus plans — a big driver of market optimism for 2017 — must pass through the budget hawks in Congress. Even if his tax cuts and infrastructure investments become law, Wall Street now increasingly views any lift to GDP growth as a 2018 story.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons Oil Prices Could Fall in 2017\n\nLet's not forget that the Federal Reserve — which Trump criticized as being overtly political in holding interest rates down during President Obama's term — has turned hawkish. After raising interest rates only twice in the last two years, the Fed has penciled in three quarter-point hikes for 2017. That will have a dampening effect on growth, stock valuations and bond market performance going forward.\n\nHistory suggests that when the dollar weakens after a sustained uptrend, the losses tend to continue: Since the 1970s, according to SentimenTrader, a trend break of the type just witnessed results in an average decline of 2.1 percent for the dollar one month later.\n\nWhy would a weak dollar spur stock market selling? Because it would upend popular \"carry trades\" that have been established in the last two months, forcing hedge fund types to cover their positions. By many measures, these institutional traders are simply unprepared for any kind of pullback.\n\nRelated: 8 Changes Coming to Your Taxes in 2017\n\nBut with Trump just a few days away from his inauguration and the task of actually governing, with the fourth quarter earnings season underway and with the next Federal Resave policy meeting just weeks away, this run of market tranquility looks set to end if the moves on the dollar, gold, and bonds is any pattern to go by.\n\nAnthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters.

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump and the leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress continue to say they will repeal the Affordable Care Act and unveil a replacement proposal at the same time. However, there is considerable concern among health care economists and other experts about the lack of a fully-articulated Republican plan.\n\nTrump and the Republicans have promised a plan that will not only cover as many Americans as the ACA, but will provide even better care at lower costs, while providing wider choice. However, all of the plans put forward so far have been outlines at best, in which hand-waving about the power of market forces does virtually all of the heavy economic lifting.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Pieces of a ‘TrumpCare’ Plan that Could Affect Your Health\n\nThis has led many to worry that the Republicans, feeling pressure to follow through on the vow to repeal Obamacare immediately, will move forward with legislation to gut the law before a replacement plan has been put in place.\n\nWhether or not that will actually happen is anybody’s guess. Perhaps Trump was telling the truth when he told The Washington Post over the weekend that he has a secret plan in the works that is almost ready for public release.\n\nBut if there is no plan, or if Congress repeals the ACA and then finds itself unable to craft a new one from the mishmash of proposals currently on the table, the consequences would be enormous for the millions of Americans currently covered by either ACA’s Medicaid expansion or by the non-group policies sold on the state health care exchanges.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation on Tuesday released an estimate of the effect of implementing H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. That’s the bill that President Obama vetoed last year, and while it isn’t being reconsidered by the new Congress, it contains many elements that virtually any repeal bill put forward would also share. Those include repeal of the ACA’s individual and employer mandates and elimination of its Medicaid expansion. H.R. 3762 also kept in place many of the insurance market reforms contained in the ACA, including a ban on refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions and on pricing according to health status.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul’s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning\n\nIf the bill were passed, according to CBO and JCT, “The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new plan year following enactment of the bill. Later, after the elimination of the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, that number would increase to 27 million, and then to 32 million in 2026.”\n\nAnd those who remained in the exchanges -- mostly older, sicker people -- would face steep premium increases.\n\n“Premiums in the nongroup market (for individual policies purchased through the marketplaces or directly from insurers) would increase by 20 percent to 25 percent—relative to projections under current law—in the first new plan year following enactment,” the report finds. “The increase would reach about 50 percent in the year following the elimination of the Medicaid expansion and the marketplace subsidies, and premiums would about double by 2026.”\n\nPerhaps most troubling of all is that premium increases aside, the elimination of the mandates would drive so many insurers out of the health care exchanges that by 2026, three out of four Americans would be living in an area in which no insurer offered nongroup policies through them.\n\n“Prior experience in states that implemented similar nongroup market reforms without a mandate penalty or subsidies has demonstrated the potential for market destabilization,” the study notes. “Several states that enacted such market reforms later repealed or substantially modified those reforms in response to increased premiums and insurers’ departure from the market.”\n\nRelated: Trump Says His Plan Would Provide ‘Insurance for Everybody’\n\nAnd for many Americans, that change would be almost immediate: “[A]bout half of the nation’s population lives in areas that would have no insurer participating in the nongroup market in the first year after the repeal of the marketplace subsidies took effect, and that share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026.”\n\nTo be clear, this scenario is not an inescapable result of ACA repeal. Congress and the president could produce an alternate proposal that would eliminate the impact of reform, or at least lessen it. However, without a clear articulation of that plan in advance, it’s natural for people who are the most vulnerable to a disrupted healthcare market to worry about a future in which Obamacare goes away, and no real replacement is ever put in place."

Insurance obtained through the federal and state exchanges could see much more substantial modifications if a repeal were to pass.\n\nThe cost of employer-sponsored health care has been on the rise for years, although the rate of the increase has been slowing as more companies shift to consumer-driven plans and find other ways to reduce costs.

    "text": "In the latest sign of mounting problems for President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, CNN reported Sunday that Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) purchased stock in a medical device manufacturer last year just days before introducing a bill aimed at protecting the company from an adverse government regulation.\n\nLast March, Price bought shares worth $1,000 to $15,000 in Zimmer-Biomet, a leading manufacturer of knee and hip replacements. Barely a week later, the senior Republican lawmaker introduced legislation designed to delay until 2018 a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement formula that analysts warned would be financially harmful to the company when fully implemented, according to the report.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nFor more than a year, Price, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon who was picked by Trump to help lead the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, had complained that CMS’s proposed reduced Medicare payments for hip and knee replacements threatened hospitals and medical providers. Zimmer-Biomet and another large manufacturer of hip and knee replacement devices stood to lose the most from the new rule.\n\nThree months after Price introduced his bill, dubbed the Health Inpatient Procedures Act of 2016 or HIP Act, Zimmer-Biomet’s political action committee contributed $1,000 to Price’s campaign committee, according to the report.\n\nThe Trump transition team immediately dismissed the CNN story as “junk reporting” and part of an effort by Senate Democrats and the liberal media to derail Price’s nomination. Price’s defenders noted that Price’s small purchase ofZimmer-Biomet stock was broker directed and that Price didn’t become aware of it until after he had introduced the bill.\n\n“Any effort to connect the introduction of bipartisan legislation by Dr. Price to any campaign contribution is demonstrably false,” said Phil Blando, the Trump transition spokesman.\n\nWhile his aides insist that the Georgia lawmaker has scrupulously adhered to congressional ethical guidelines, Price nonetheless has come under intense scrutiny by Senate Democrats and public watchdogs for possibly engaging in insider trading for years, a violation of federal ethics law.\n\nA recent analysis by The Wall Street Journal found that Price bought and sold stock worth more than $300,000 in 40 health care, pharmaceutical, and biomedical companies since 2012. The conservative Republican is a member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, which oversees Medicare and other government health programs, and until recently he also chaired the Budget Committee.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy\n\nHis stock holdings have included Aetna Inc., Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. In recent years he has sponsored or co-sponsored 44 bills with potentially important financial impact on the U.S. health care system, insurers and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nPrice invested last year in a major prescription drug distribution company that over the years has been linked to the nationwide epidemic of opioid abuse and deadly overdoses. McKesson Corp., the largest drug distributor in the U.S., has been the target of two publicly disclosed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration actions, according to The Washington Post. The company subsequently paid $163 million in fines in response to allegations that it “failed to report hundreds of suspicious orders for millions of pain pills” from Internet pharmacies and others, according to the newspaper.\n\nLate last week, Price listed McKesson Corp as one of the 43 stocks he intends to sell as part of a major divestiture of his financial holdings and business interests. That move was made in anticipation of Senate hearings into his nomination to become secretary of health and human services. Those hearings before the Finance Committee likely will extend through mid-February because of the complexity of his case.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nPrice appears to be one of Trump’s more vulnerable cabinet nominees. Senate Democrats are likely to ask him about his stock portfolio and evidence that he sometimes coordinated stock transactions with his legislative action or may have used insider information gleaned from his congressional duties to inform his investments.\n\nLarry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, told CNN, said that Price’s action “clearly has the appearance of using your influence as a congressman to your financial benefit.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/17/Why-Political-Mainstream-Keeps-Failing-America-s-Workers",
    "text": "Millions of Americans spend every day preoccupied with whether they can make a better life for themselves than their parents did, and whether they can pass on that opportunity to their children. They are concerned that you can no longer accomplish these goals in America simply through hard work and perseverance. They see social mobility waning, inequality soaring, wages only now starting to accelerate after 15 years of dormancy. And they fear entry into a workplace of the future that looks disconnected and powerless.\n\nConservatives tell a coherent story in reaction, even if it’s a non sequitur — government regulations and government taxes sap the initiative from job creators. So does the left, if you seek out their views — corporate greed and power captures too much of the gains of productive work. The muddle has come from those in the political center, dumbfounded about how to combat forces they helped set in motion. And they haven’t gotten any better at it since Trump’s election shattered their world.\n\nRelated: The White House Plan to Cushion the Blow When Robots Take Your Job\n\nLast week, the Aspen Institute’s Future of Work Initiative issued a report called “Toward a New Capitalism,” identifying challenges facing the American workplace and specific steps to fix it. You can’t place yourself much closer to the political center than with the team that produced this document. With financial support from nine foundations, Apple and asset management giant BlackRock, the co-chairs included center-left Senator Mark Warner, center-right former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, George W. Bush’s Domestic Policy Council director John Bridgeland and his immediate predecessor, Bruce Reed, former head of the Democratic Leadership Council. It doesn’t get more mainstream and technocratic.\n\nTo their credit, the authors wrestle with a legitimate problem: the broken social contract between workers and employers. Corporate America, obsessed with short-term growth, squeezes its labor force to help achieve it.\n\nModern businesses, when not outsourcing jobs abroad, have stepped up reliance on independent contractors who aren’t employees, and therefore not entitled to most benefits. Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger estimate that nearly all the net employment in the Obama era came from so-called “alternative work arrangements” like freelance or temporary work. According to the report, these trends lead to lower wages, reduced benefits, a lower labor share of national income, stagnant economic growth and living standards, workforce disinvestment and more reliance on government safety nets. “The failure to shore up democratic capitalism,” the report concludes, “poses grave dangers to democracy and capitalism alike.”\n\nRelated: Trump Is Wrong When It Comes to Saving American Jobs\n\nWith that wind-up, you might expect a radical break with the status quo, something that could really ensure broadly shared prosperity for everyone who participates in the economy. You wouldn’t expect 13 different types of tax breaks, which I counted in the solutions chapter of the document.\n\nThis includes a wide variety of business tax cuts for worker education and training, a typical obsession of centrist types who implicitly blame workers for not having the right skills to compete in the global economy. In this case, the recommendations effectively bribe companies to finance these programs. Other tax breaks encourage employee stock ownership and wage increases. Workers would get a few of these tax benefits directly, but most would be funneled through their employers.\n\nThe conceit here is that the tax code offers too many incentives for physical investment capital rather than human capital. But the recommendation is not to roll back those investment capital giveaways, but to slash business taxes further in a bank shot to benefit workers. The only result is drastically reduced corporate tax revenues, and less money available for social insurance. Later in the document, the authors recommend an overhaul of the tax code to lower rates and broaden the base, but virtually all the tax cuts preceding it would tighten that base through targeted tax breaks. It’s all carrots to businesses, and nearly no sticks.\n\nRelated: It's Not the Skills Gap — Why So Many Jobs Are Going Unfilled\n\nIt’s in reacting to the so-called “on-demand economy” that the technocratic center reveals itself. As I’ve written before, the mode of survival for the Ubers of the world lies in harvesting giant government subsidies to make their sketchy business models work. In the name of helping workers, the Aspen Institute report goes right along with that.\n\nThe authors recommend that unemployment insurance offices should maintain an updated directory of on-demand, app-based jobs, effectively becoming a publicly funded headhunter service for private companies seeking desperate labor. They even suggest “states should be allowed to experiment with using a portion of unemployment funds to buy equipment to lend out to beneficiaries.” So public money — perhaps even taken out of unemployment insurance checks, though that’s not clear — would go to buying used Chromebooks that the recently unemployed could borrow to get on Taskrabbit or Lyft.\n\nI don’t recall unemployment programs ever lending workers power tools, or a bus pass or any other equipment they might need to land a job. But government should spare no expense in funneling the unemployed into the very contract-labor positions the report’s authors spent an entire paper identifying as contributing to the decline of the American workplace?\n\nRelated: Why 2017 Should Be a Very Good Year for Finding a New Job\n\nThe real goal here appears to be to kick people off public assistance. “If evidence shows on-demand platforms lower barriers to employment, then work requirements should be applied to certain safety net programs as appropriate,” the report recommends. This would force people into contingent labor arrangements to keep their benefits. On-demand companies wouldn’t benefit more from these recommendations if they wrote them on their own.\n\nThere are a few nice ideas in the report, from boosting worker representation on the job (not through unions, which are barely mentioned, but worker councils) to encouraging long-term investment to exploring portable benefits that freelance or temp workers can use (though only with state-level pilot programs). But the reliance on tax breaks and the special dispensation for on-demand work lets the slip show. The cure for an atomized workplace is further atomization, fragmenting collective worker power. The only way for workers to achieve success is through bribing employers and hoping the crumbs fall from the C-suites into their hands.\n\nIf that’s the considered response from the establishment center to our economic problems, it’s no surprise that populism is on the rise. Ideas like bolstering unions or breaking up concentrated markets sit far outside the centrist range of conception. They’re so far removed from the experience of workers that they can’t imagine how to use policy tools to truly empower them. Democrats must break away from these managerial-class solutions if they want to deliver for anyone but the powerful."

    "text": "As Democrats gear up for a nationwide campaign to try to salvage Obamacare, President-elect Donald Trump says he is putting the finishing touches on his plan to replace the national health insurance plan with a conservative Republican approach that would provide “insurance for everybody.”\n\nIt took President Obama and congressional Democrats more than 14 months to negotiate and approve the Affordable Care Act in 2010 without the support of a single Republican. Yet, Trump insists he is already putting the finishing touches on an alternative approach he is confident he can push through the GOP-controlled Congress shortly after taking office on Friday.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul’s Obamacare Substitute: Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning\n\nWithout providing any details, Trump told The Washington Post over the weekend that his approach would further reduce the percentage of uninsured Americans – already the lowest in history under Obamacare – while constraining soaring premiums and out of pocket costs for consumers. The House and Senate late last week voted to begin a budgetary process to repeal key features of the Affordable Care Act that likely will be completed by early next month.\n\nIn a bid to ease mounting concerns among rank and file Republicans that the repeal effort could trigger chaos in the private health insurance market and result in millions of people losing their coverage, Trump and congressional Republican leaders have vowed to craft a replacement plan to have ready to go at roughly the same time they repeal Obamacare.\n\n“It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes,” Trump told the Washington Post. “We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon.” He repeated that he is waiting until the Senate confirms his choice for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, before completing work on the proposal, which probably won’t occur until mid-February. But Trump made it clear he will expect congressional leaders to swiftly act on repealing and replacing Obamacare, virtually simultaneously.\n\n“The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” he said.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nWhen asked whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his strategy for replacing Obamacare, Trump replied “no” – just as he pledged not to cut Medicare or Social Security during the campaign. However, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Price and others have advocated overhauling Medicare and Medicaid and reducing their costs as part of a larger recasting of federal health insurance policies.\n\nTrump also reiterated his intention to target the pharmaceutical industry in a bid to block excessive price increases and to strengthen the hand of Medicare and Medicaid officials in negotiating down the cost of prescription medicine for the elderly and the poor.\n\nWhile Trump boasted that he and House and Senate congressional leaders were on a fast track to replacing the Affordable Care Act, prominent Democrats held as many as 70 rallies throughout the country over the weekend seeking to block the dismantling of President Obama’s signature health insurance plan that has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a leading progressive voice and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took part in a rally called, “Our First Stand: Save Health Care” in Warren Michigan.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nSanders said that while there are strong differences of opinion over the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act, “very few Americans believe that we should repeal the ACA without a replacement program to make it better.” He added, “Know we are saying to our Republican colleagues: We will not allow you to throw up to 30 million Americans off of health insurance.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), helped stage a similar rally Sunday at Boston’s Faneuil Hall, while Sen. Kamal Harris (D-CA) headlined another rally in Los Angeles. And a handful of liberal groups on Tuesday will launch a two-month bus tour across the country to seek opposition to the Republican effort to replace Obamacare."

    "title": "Team Trump Steps Up Intimidation of Government Ethics Officer",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/16/Team-Trump-Steps-Intimidation-Government-Ethics-Officer",
    "text": "The government ethics officer who last week criticized President-elect Donald Trump for his decision not to divest himself of his assets before taking office is now under fire from both Trump’s transition team and the chairman of a committee in the House of Representatives that could stand in the way of his agency’s legislative reauthorization.\n\nWithout presenting any evidence, Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, on Sunday accused Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, of being ethically compromised himself. Not long afterward House Oversight and Investigations Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) declared that he believes Shaub, in criticizing Trump, has been “unethical.”\n\nRelated: Blind Trust in Donald Trump Could Be Costly\n\nThe anger at Shaub arose primarily from remarks he delivered at the Brookings Institution last week, in which he declared Trump’s plan to hand over management of his company to his sons while retaining ownership a “meaningless” gesture that does nothing to ameliorate the conflicts of interest he will face as president. Like many ethics experts, Shaub had said that only total divestiture would insulate Trump from potential accusations of self-dealing.\n\n“It's important to understand that the president is now entering a world of public service. He's going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices,” he said. “He's going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.”\n\nPriebus, in an appearance on ABC’s This Week, sounded a vaguely threatening note, saying, “The head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political. Apparently, may have made a -- publicly supported Hillary Clinton as calling out the president with information on Twitter about our disentangling of the business over a month ago.\n\n“So I'm not so sure what this person at Government Ethics, what sort of standing he has anymore in giving these opinions.”\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Could Actually Hurt the US\n\nChaffetz, appearing on the same program, called attention to a series of tweets from the OGE Twitter account from Nov. 30, which Shaub had written. They praised Trump for his “decision” to divest his assets, despite the fact that the president-elect had made no such announcement. Shaub later said that he was trying to nudge Trump in the right direction using “the vernacular of the president-elect’s favorite social media platform.\n\n“My question is about the head of the Office of Government Ethics. Is he acting ethically when he sent out nine tweets praising Donald Trump saying that his plan was brilliant?” Chaffetz asked. “How did he come to that conclusion? And how does he come to his current conclusions having never done an investigation and never looked at the paperwork in the point where he can actually come to a reasonable conclusion? I think that's unethical.”\n\nChaffetz last week released a letter he had sent Shaub demanding that he present himself to staff members of his committee for a “transcribed interview” and left no doubt that the funding of his agency -- and his job -- would hang on whether or not Chaffetz approved of his answers.\n\nHe also said that he was not inclined to request information on Trump’s businesses once he is sworn in. Multiple ethics experts have warned that as both president and owner of the Trump Organization, Trump will immediately be in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which bars elected officials from accepting payments from foreign governments. Chaffetz said investigating Trump’s ties to foreign governments would be a “fishing expedition.”\n\nIndeed, the emoluments clause is not as black and white as some have alleged. Two different articles by constitutional scholars highlight the ambiguity. A piece in The New York Times by Seth Barrett Tillman argues that the Foreign Gifts Clause in the constitution does not apply to the President. Whether or not Donald Trump is violating the letter or spirit of the emoluments law is argued in The Washington Post by Jonathan H. Adler who says:\n\n“Whether or not one concludes that Trump’s business dealings violate the letter or the spirit of the Emoluments Clause, the underlying controversy is almost certainly non-justiciable. It is difficult to conceive of a scenario in which someone would have standing to challenge Trump’s arrangements and even harder to think what sort of remedy could be ordered by a court. In other words, if there are concerns about how President Trump handles his various investments, the only remedies will be political.”\n\nRelated: Trump’s Health Secretary Invested in a Company Linked to the Opioid Epidemic\n\nThe pressure being put on Shaub, and the disinterest in Trump’s potential conflicts has infuriated longtime ethics experts.\n\nAmbassador Norman Eisen, the former chief ethics officer for the Obama administration, said, “I think that is terrible. Walt Shaub is a dedicated public servant, has come up through the ranks under both Democrats and Republicans...Walt Shaub is a true ethics hero for speaking out.”\n\n“The Office of Government Ethics has taken the right position on this, one consistent with many Republicans and Democrats,” said Richard Painter, the former chief ethics officer for the George W. Bush administration.\n\n“I believe yes, if he doesn't make sure that all the foreign government payments -- and this includes banks and other corporations owned by foreign governments and sovereign wealth funds, that all of that money is not out of the Trump organization by Friday, when he takes the oath, he will be in violation of the Constitution,\" Painter said.\n\nEisen went on to criticize Chaffetz for placing his focus on a bureaucrat rather than the incoming president. “Why is Congressman Chaffetz investigating Walter Shaub for doing his job...for speaking so courageously? It was one of the most extraordinary acts of courage that I've seen from a career public official. Instead of investigating the fact that the president-elect is going to be violating the Constitution?”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/16/Rand-Paul-s-Obamacare-Substitute-Take-Two-Aspirin-and-Call-Me-Morning",
    "text": "As the incoming Trump administration over the weekend reaffirmed its commitment to simultaneously repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky got an early jump in promoting his vision of a suitable – but relatively threadbare – replacement.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CNN, Paul unveiled the broad outlines of his plan that contains a number of measures favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), the nominee to become the next secretary of Health and Human Services. Those include tax credits to help Americans defray the cost of health insurance premiums and increased use of tax-exempt Health Savings Accounts.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nBut central to Paul’s approach is totally scrapping Obamacare mandates and minimum coverage requirements that the Kentucky lawmaker says discourage younger, healthier Americans from purchasing individual plans. Instead, Paul favors dramatic changes in the system that would foster the sale of cheap, bare-bone health insurance policies.\n\nCurrently plans sold in the individual market under Obamacare must include 10 “minimum essential benefits,” such as doctors’ services, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, prescription drug coverage, pregnancy and childbirth and mental health services. Paul would scrap all those requirements and allow people to purchase coverage keyed to their specific needs and income.\n\nComing this week: THE Obamacare replacement bill. Done drafting the bill & will be discussing on @CNN Sunday AM and all week next week! pic.twitter.com/ycpBNBknOl — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 15, 2017\n\n“So one of the key reforms we do is we’re going to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance,” Paul told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That means getting rid of the Obamacare mandate on what you can buy.”\n\nThat approach would also have the effect of lowering the overall quality of health care in the country, but Paul didn’t comment on that. Moreover, it would make it far more difficult for major insurers to offset the cost of providing coverage to older and sicker beneficiaries with substantial premium payments from younger Americans.\n\nRelated: 5 Key Pieces of a ‘TrumpCare’ Plan that Could Affect Your Health\n\nPaul said he will also press for authorization for small businesses to band together to form networks to purchase insurance at a relatively low cost. Paul, who worked for years as an eye surgeon, said, “There’s no reason why someone with four employees shouldn’t be able to join with hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that are small to become a large entity to get leverage to bring your prices down.”\n\nHe said those negotiations with insurers could also be used to guarantee the availability of policies that \"can't cancel you and guarantees the issue of the insurance even if you get sick.\"\n\nPaul dodged the question of whether many of the 20 million Americans currently receiving coverage under Obamacare would lose their coverage under his approach. A key question is whether the Republican majority in Congress and the Trump administration will attempt to rescind expanded Medicaid that provides the vast majority of Obamacare coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly 400,000 Kentucky residents would stand to lose coverage if that were to happen.\n\nPaul appeared to favor eliminating expanded Medicaid, insisting that the federal government can’t afford to finance the program indefinitely with the national debt fast approaching $20 trillion.\n\n“My point is that we should be honest about it,” Paul said. “If Kentucky or Tennessee or Ohio wants to expand Medicaid and they say we have a lot of people struggling and we’re willing to help them, that’s fine. Probably we should then raise the taxes on everybody in Kentucky [and the other states] to pay for Medicaid,” he added. “Instead, we have this deceitfulness of President Obama saying it would be free.”\n\nRelated: Trump Promises to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nPaul last week was one of the first on Capitol Hill to align himself with President-elect Donald Trump in insisting it would be a huge tactical mistake for the GOP to dismantle key elements of the Obamacare law before pulling together replacement legislation. He believes that garnering the support of rank-and-file Republicans would quell fears of chaos in the insurance market and the loss of coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nSome GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Paul’s fellow Kentuckian, argued that the Republican-controlled Congress should first approve a budget resolution repealing key elements of Obamacare, including its subsidies, taxes and mandates, before beginning the challenging task of adopting a replacement plan. McConnell said that Congress would follow up Obamacare repeal legislation with a replacement program “very quickly,” but without setting a timetable.\n\nBut President-elect Donald Trump last Wednesday made it clear that action to repeal and replace had to occur at the same time – possibly on the same day or “the same hour” – and Paul agrees.\n\n“I believe that it’s incredibly important that we do replacement on the same day as we do repeal,” Paul told Tapper. “We’ve had six years to complain [about Obamacare] and we have complained. I’ve been one of those complaining about Obamacare. Replacement should be the same day.”\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nLate last week, the Senate and House voted to begin the legislative process that would culminate in final action – perhaps as early as next month -- to repeal Obamacare, but without addressing a possible replacement. Paul was the lone Republican in the Senate to vote against the resolution while nine Republicans in the House also opposed it.\n\nRyan and other GOP House leaders now say they agree with Trump that repeal and replace must be accomplished simultaneously, in order to keep their campaign pledge and reassure the public and the insurance industry. McConnell has been non-committal on the topic, in part because he will need Democratic support in order to adopt comprehensive replacement legislation.\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence reaffirmed Trump’s pledge to get both tasks accomplished in record time during an appearance on the “Fox News Sunday” program.\n\n“The president-elect made it very clear to leaders in the Congress this week that he wanted to do both at the same time,” Pence said. “I would anticipate that in the first 100 days that we will deliver on that promise to the American people.”"

    "text": "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.\n\nIn a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nRELATED: FOR TOO FEW, DR. KING'S DREAM HAS BECOME REALITY\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\n\n\n\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, \"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.\"\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!\n\nLet freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!\n\nBut not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\n\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\""

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/16/Blind-Trust-Donald-Trump-Could-Be-Costly",
    "text": "Donald Trump has refused to divest himself of his business interests before being inaugurated as president and has instead said he would hand control over to his sons. However, as the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, Jr., said in a letter last December, a point he reiterated after Trump announced his plan to turn control over to his sons last week, “Transferring operational control of a company to one's children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest.\"\n\nIn response, Trump argues that his numerous conflicts of interest won’t affect his decisions as president. But there have already been instances where meetings with foreign leaders had a clear connection to his business pursuits, his nominations for important government positions show a strong bias toward favoring business interests, and his proposed legislative agenda, while touted as a populist, contains the standard Republican pro-business slate of policies. The stage is set for those coming into power to use their government offices to enrich themselves, and if they do, it has the potential to undermine US competitiveness and reduce long-term economic growth.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Could Actually Hurt the US\n\nEconomists use the term “principal-agent problem” to describe one important way in which conflicts of interest can be harmful. The principal-agent problem describes a situation where the person who is making important decisions (e.g. a manager in business) is not the same as the person or people whose interests are being served (e.g. shareholders). If the manager pursues his or her own interests, for example taking what amount to lavish vacations and charging it to the company instead of maximizing profit on behalf of shareholders, then in effect money that should have gone to shareholders goes to the manager instead – it is taken from them.\n\nThere are many, many instances where principal-agent type conflicts of interest exist, parents making decisions for their children, elected officials representing the interests of constituents, investment fund managers operating on behalf of investors, and so on. Economists have spent considerable effort figuring out how to design institutions and contracts to minimize the chance that those with decision-making power promote their personal interests over the interests of those they represent (for example by making mangers’ salaries depend upon the long-term profitability of the company), and the solutions economists have proposed for the conflict of interest problem can be effective in many cases.\n\nBut when it comes to politicians representing the interests of constituents, adjusting institutions to prevent unethical behavior is difficult if not impossible, and we cannot write contracts between politicians and constituents the way we can between, say, the managers and owners of firms. We have to rely upon politicians’ honor in upholding their oath to represent their constituent’s best interests and the checks and balances such as Senate confirmation for those they appoint to key government positions. In Trump’s case, I have little faith that Congress will stand in the way when potential conflicts of interest arise for his nominees, and even less faith that his choices as president will be independent of his business interests.\n\nFor an individual business, the harm that conflicts of interest can cause goes beyond, for example, taking money out of shareholders pockets and giving it to managers. It also undermines the efficiency and competitiveness of the firm. The same is true for the nation as a whole. Just like managers taking from shareholders, politicians and government officials can manipulate taxes, the regulatory environment, the provision of government services, and so on to enrich themselves at the expense of others. But this is harmful to the economy.\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Will Come Back to Bite Him … And Us\n\nPolicies such as removing regulations that address important market failures, favoring one business over another (picking winners and losers as Trump has already shown a tendency to do), and imposing tariffs on imported goods have the effect of insulating firms from the foreign and domestic competitive forces that compel them to innovate and operate efficiently, both of which are keys to maximizing long-run economic growth. To make matters worse, the political system itself can be manipulated by those in power to perpetuate their hold on government leading to even more looting of the economy, and even more long-run damage to our economic potential.\n\nThe Republicans are fond of calling low-income households “takers.” But it’s abundantly clear that the real takers are those who use their wealth, influence, and government positions to enrich themselves and their cronies at the expense of others without seeming to care how much damage it does to the economy, or how many people might be harmed by the large cuts to essential social services that will be needed to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nTrump is not president yet. So I can’t say for sure if he will continue or even expand upon the recent Republican tradition of favoring the interests of the wealthy and powerful over the interests of the working class while disregarding long-standing government ethics and norms along the way. But the signs are anything but encouraging."

    "text": "The outgoing director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan, had strong words for President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday, just days after the incoming commander in chief compared the US Intelligence Community to Nazis and repeatedly suggested that the CIA and others were actively working against him.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Brennan suggested that Trump has much to learn about the dangers facing the country, and said he hopes that the next president will focus less on defending himself from slights on social media and more on the threats that the Intelligence Community is working to combat.\n\nRelated: For Putin and Russia, Hacking Has Unintended Consequences\n\n“What I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him, and it's about the United States and our national security,” Brennan said. “And he has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security, as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. national security interests are protected and are advanced.”\n\nHe said that he hopes Trump will get out of the habit of reacting spontaneously to events, whether major or trivial, without thinking through his position, hopefully with his advisers.\n\n“Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,” he said. “And so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound. Again, it's more than just about Mr. Trump, and it's about the United States of America.”\n\nIn a few days, he said, Trump will be “the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government,” adding, “I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact.”\n\nRelated: On Day One, Trump Faces Two Huge Foreign Policy Challenges\n\nAnd Brennan made it plain that he doesn’t believe Trump has, at this point, fully grasped the nature of the challenge in front of him. He appeared most concerned about Trump’s conciliatory attitude toward Russia. The president-elect spent months denigrating the Intelligence Community’s finding that the Kremlin ordered the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and prominent individual Democrats in an effort to influence the US presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump finally admitted that he accepted the evidence that Russia had perpetrated the hack, though he and his team continue to downplay the impact of the steady stream of leaked documents that dominated coverage of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the final month of the campaign.\n\nBrennan, on Sunday, didn’t seem convinced that Trump has truly absorbed the intelligence agencies’ finding that Russian meddling in the election process was a major and unprecedented attack on US Democracy. He also sounded concerned about Trump’s appreciation of Russia’s new role on the world stage.\n\n“I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world,” Brennan said.\n\nRelated: Trump Bites Back at Buzzfeed and the Media for Publishing Fake News\n\nThat will be part of the job facing US intelligence agencies in the coming months, he said, as Trump makes decisions about how to respond -- or not -- to the Kremlin’s provocations. “What we need to do is make sure that Mr. Trump and vice president-elect. Mr. Pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions.\n\nWallace asked if he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration might act quickly to remove economic sanctions that were put in place against Russia for its election attacking as well as its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“I think he has to be mindful that he does not yet have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing,” the CIA director said.\n\nWallace asked Brennan to address Trump’s claim that intelligence agencies may have been responsible for leaking a dubious dossier of supposed compromising information on Trump, including reported video of the president-elect in engaging in potentially embarrassing sexual activity. (The dossier had, in fact, been in the possession of news outlets for months, dating back to before Trump’s unexpected election victory on November 8.)\n\nRelated: The Simple Fact Donald Trump Is Missing About the ‘Leaked’ Documents\n\n“I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out be so false and fake out,” Trump said Wednesday. “I think it's a disgrace, and I say that and I say that and that something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.”\n\nBrennan called Trump’s comparing the intelligence agencies to Nazis “outrageous” and pointed out that the documents in question were already circulating.\n\n“I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly,” he said.\n\nHe said that it is vital to establish a strong relationship of Trust between the incoming president and the intelligence services. “I think the world is watching now what Mr. Trump says, and listening very carefully. If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?”"

    "text": "As noted Russia expert Sarah Palin might ask of Vladimir Putin: “How’s all that hackin’ workin’ for ya?”\n\nMore than a week after chieftains of the American intelligence community much maligned by Donald Trump presented the president-elect with a “high-confidence” report that the little red menace of Moscow was behind a multi-pronged effort to disrupt the U.S. elections, deny Hillary Clinton the presidency, and tilt the outcome to the man in the high tower, the answer is probably “Not that great.”\n\nRelated: Amid Hacking Row, Pressure Builds on Trump to Soften Pro-Russia Rhetoric\n\nCertainly, Russia’s wily president got one outcome he was after: Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th president in less than a week. However, there is no evidence yet that the Kremlin’s gremlins had any measurable effect on the outcome of the voting, as incoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer rightly told Fox News on Jan 2.\n\nBut after a week of the Senate questioning Trump Cabinet nominees, the unintended consequences of hacking into the Democratic National Committee, releasing embarrassing emails via WikiLeaks, promoting fake news and using the state-sponsored TV network Russia Today (RT) to disseminate pro-Trump and anti-Clinton content are becoming clearer.\n\n(It should be noted that Julian Assange, the fugitive co-founder of WkiLeaks who can lately count Fox News’s Sean Hannity and failed vice-presidential candidate Palin as groupies, claims the source of the emails was “not the Russian government and… not a state party.” And certainly, a man on the run from charges of rape and molestation would never shade the truth.)\n\nIn any case, Putin has invited retribution, which President Obama was happy to provide, putting a gaggle of spies on the first Aeroflot flight to Moscow and imposing sanctions on four Russian intelligence officials.\n\nBut more important, Putin has underlined the fact that Russia is an enemy of the American people, infuriated many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and led the likely new leaders of the Defense Dept. and CIA to pledge that they will always have the Kremlin in their crosshairs.\n\nRelated: Trump's Pentagon Pick Says U.S. Must Be Ready to Confront Russia\n\nFormer Marine General James Mattis, who will almost certainly be confirmed as Defense Secretary, told senators that Putin is trying to undermine the NATO alliance. “There’s a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively and increasing numbers of areas where we’re going to have to confront Russia,” he said.\n\nMike Pompeo, the Harvard-educated lawyer and Tea Party congressman from Kansas who is a shoo-in for director of the CIA, said at his hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia is among the top threats to the U.S.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who has called Putin a thug, said at the Mattis hearing that he had watched three presidents commit themselves to a new relationship with the Russian leader and each effort was “an abysmal failure.” He asked the former general: “Should we ignore the lessons of history in our relationship with Vladimir Putin?”\n\nMattis said that since Yalta, the instances of constructive engagement with Russia have been few, adding: “I think the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with with Mr. Putin.”\n\nThat reality could collide with the reality-TV president’s view of Putin and Russia, which during the campaign and right up until his briefing by the intelligence chiefs, has been a fawning and cloying spectacle.\n\nStill, Congress seems to have grown impatient with the Donald and Vladi bromance.\n\nRex Tillerson, who played footsie with Putin as CEO of ExxonMobil, took heat during his confirmation hearing to be Secretary of State because he was not sufficiently critical of the Russian leader, declining to label him a “war criminal,” as Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida demanded. That is unlikely to derail his confirmation, but Tillerson’s future dealings with Moscow will always be suspect.\n\nFormer CIA officer Will Hurd, a Republican representative from Texas, told The New York Times that Russian intelligence will look at efforts to disrupt the American election as its “most successful covert action operation because it created a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the U.S. president, intelligence community and the American public.”\n\nThat may be true. But once the spooks in Moscow are finished partying, they and their Kremlin control agent could be in for a long, ugly hangover."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/13/5-Key-Pieces-TrumpCare-Plan-Could-Affect-Your-Health",
    "text": "The House on Friday voted to join the Senate in approving a budget resolution that puts GOP lawmakers and President-elect Donald Trump on a politically fraught legislative path to eventually repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature 2010 health insurance program that currently insures more than 20 million Americans.\n\nThe 227 to 198 vote in the Republican-controlled House to begin the perilous process was motivated more by GOP lawmakers’ disdain for Obamacare and its soaring premiums and out of pocket costs than out of conviction their party has a far superior replacement plan waiting in the wings. Four committees in the House and Senate now must report back to the Senate and House Budget Committees by Jan. 27 with specific language for eviscerating key provisions of the law, including taxes, premium subsidies and mandates.\n\nRelated: Congress Is Headed for a Showdown With Trump Over Obamacare Repeal\n\nThen the GOP leadership must sell the final package to their members in the House and the Senate before holding final votes in the two chambers. But that, in the greater scheme of things, will be the easy part, since special budget reconciliation rules being utilized by the GOP will require a simple majority vote in the two chambers to pass the resolution.\n\nThe heavy lifting will come when the leaders must craft and sell a legitimate and workable replacement program to Republican rank and file as well as some moderate Democrats, whose support will be critical in pushing through a replacement plan without the reconciliation protections. Without reconciliation, it will take at least 60 votes in the Senate to adopt new health care legislation. Right now, the Republicans hold a narrow 52 to 48 majority, which is not nearly enough to work their will.\n\nFor all the Republicans’ brave talk about swiftly upending Obamacare and writing a replacement within days or weeks of Trump’s ascension to power, major legislative and programmatic surgery of this sort is proving extraordinarily challenging. That is becoming especially true amid growing fears that the GOP’s strong-arm tactics could foster chaos in the health insurance markets and ultimately strip millions of Americans of their coverage under Obamacare and expanded Medicaid.\n\nTrump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week said they would concurrently repeal and replace measures within the first 100 days (on the outside) of the Republican President-elect’s administration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been far more cautious, saying that Congress must first repeal Obamacare and then turn its attention to a replacement approach.\n\nRelated: Trump Promises to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\n“Definitely there is a plan within the first 100 days to get moving on this legislation,” Ryan said Thursday night during his appearance on a nationally televised CNN town hall meeting.\n\n“I believe we can and should have a system in this country where everybody can have access to affordable health care, including people with pre-existing conditions, no matter how much money they make,” Ryan said as he began what will likely be an uphill campaign to sell to lawmakers and their constituents. “That’s not what the [Obamacare] law is doing. This law is failing on this front, and I think there’s a much, much better system that could be put in its place.”\n\nYet even as an overwhelming number of GOP lawmakers in the House lined up behind Ryan on Friday to approve the budget resolution to get the repeal process underway, many voiced uneasiness that their leaders and Trump may be biting off more than they can chew without a clear pathway to a new law. “We just want more specifics,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chair of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus, told The Washington Post yesterday. “We need to know what we’re going to replace it with.”\n\nNine Republicans broke with the leadership and voted against the budget resolution this afternoon, while the Democrats were united in opposing the measure.\n\nThe Democrats are accusing Ryan and others of leading Congress on a reckless mission to dismantle a system that has more benefits than flaws, and with no consensus within the GOP over precisely how to replace Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\n“We recognize that there are ways it can be improved,” said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “But the idea that there is a plan competing on the other side is just hilarious.”\n\n“This is the problem with the exercise we are going through,” he added. “We are heading down a road with no final determination or destination. We’re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all of the protections that we have provided for 300 million Americans – expanded coverage, expanded guarantees and benefits and quality, and we don’t know what’s the alternative.”\n\n“Waving around a bunch of papers does not mean there’s a plan—does not mean that the Republicans can say to the American public, ‘Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get finished with our repeal and replace.’ If we go down this path, we won’t have repeal and replace. What we will have is repeal and repent.”\n\nThe Republicans have spent the better part of six years attempting to upend the Affordable Care Act, but to this day they not developed an alternative that could gain the blessing of the vast majority of their members. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump floated a number of disparate proposals, including retaining some of the most popular features of Obamacare. Those include allowing children to remain on their parents’ health insurance plans until age 26 and barring insurers from discriminating against applicants with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nRyan, meanwhile, tried to build interest in his “GOP Better Way” approach to health care reform last summer with a glossy document containing high concepts and a raft of proposals. However, a lot of the proposals were sketchy, and he offered no clues as to how many people would retain their health insurance coverage and how much the program would cost.\n\nRyan’s approach is similar to one that Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services, has been touting for years and that he converted into the Empowering Patients First Act. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, would start from scratch with a “patient-centered solution” and greater reliance on market forces than government intervention.\n\nWhile there are numerous differences between the three approaches, all share at least five things in common that are likely to be retained when GOP leaders and health care experts turn their attention to the drawing board and produce a first draft of TrumpCare. Here are brief summaries:\n\nState operated “high-risk pools.” Before the advent of Obamacare, older and sicker Americans who had trouble buying private insurance because of the prohibitive premium costs turned to states for assistance in purchasing more reasonably priced coverage in subsidized insurance pools. If Republicans repeal Obamacare, these older and sicker people likely will need help high-risk the states in finding relatively affordable coverage. Ryan and others are discussing providing states with at least $25 billion to help ease their financial burden. Some critics say the old system didn’t work very well, and that many of the insurance plans were inadequate.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nRefundable tax credits for those without employer, Medicare or Medicaid coverage. Many conservatives have complained over the years that it is unfair that employer-paid premiums for health insurance are exempted from federal income taxes, while employees without coverage in the workplace must buy insurance themselves without the benefit of a tax write-off.\n\nRyan and Price are advocating a “refundable” tax credit that people of all income groups can use to buy coverage in the private markets. Premium payments could be directly written off individual’s income tax obligations. Low-income people who pay little or no federal income tax would qualify for a tax refund to help cover their premium costs. However, some analysts say that Price’s approach is far less generous than previous GOP proposals.\n\nFor one thing, there is no income test under Price’s approach as there is under Obamacare. Instead, the credit is adjusted for age, with older Americans getting the lion’s share of the benefit. The credit would provide $1,200 for someone 18 to 35 to purchase an annual policy, $2,100 for those 35 to 50, and $3,000 for those who are 50 and over. At a time of steadily mounting premiums and out-of-pocket costs, the Price approach would likely cover just a fraction of Americans’ annual health insurance costs.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts. These tax-exempt accounts are a fixture in many workplaces, and the Republicans would provide incentives to employers and employees to expand their use. The idea is to encourage workers to sock away money for unexpected or uncovered medical expenses throughout the year. Employers and individuals would jointly make contributions to the accounts. There were $34.7 billion in roughly 18.2 million HSA accounts last year, according to Forbes. And if the Republicans have their way, there will be plenty more.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Dilemma: Can He Repeal Obamacare Without Killing Medicare?\n\nSelling health insurance across state lines. This idea is one of Trump’s favorites, and he mentioned it frequently throughout the campaign. In effect, insurance companies could market their individual plans to consumers in any state as long as they are licensed in their home states and adhere to their home-state regulations.\n\nHowever, The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump’s interstate insurance marketing plan is meeting resistance from state insurance regulators, the health insurance industry and independent health care analysts who say the approach has been tried before on a limited basis and has many shortcomings.\n\nConverting Medicaid to a block grant program. The future of federally-funded Medicaid programs for the poor could be very much up in the air, like Trump, Ryan and Price all are pressing for major reforms and savings. The proposal would allow states to choose whether to continue to accept federal Medicaid funding as a per capita cap or to take it as a block grant – and then exercise control over how the money is spent.\n\nAlthough the fiscal impact of the change is far from clear, some analysts say that the federal funding would be far below current levels. And Republican governors and state legislatures would be likely to tighten regulations for qualifying for coverage."

    "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) had some comforting advice for a trembling, undocumented Hispanic woman from Oklahoma standing before him Thursday night during a nationally televised CNN town hall meeting who is worried that he she will be deported after President-elect Donald Trump takes office Jan. 20.\n\nWith her young daughter at her side, Angelica Villalobos asked Ryan, “Do you think that I should be deported?” Although she currently is protected by an Obama administration policy for undocumented people who were brought to the U.S. illegally while they were children, her fear is that all bets will be off once Trump takes the reins and begins to make good on his early campaign pledge to deport millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Rejects Trump’s Plan to Deport 12 Million Illegal Immigrants\n\n“No,” Ryan replied, “I can see that you love your daughter, that you’re a nice person that has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future’s here. And so, what we have to do is find a way so that you can get right with the law, and we’ve got to do this in a good way so that the rug doesn’t get pulled out from under you and your family gets separated.”\n\nRyan, a one-time champion of major reform of immigration laws that would provide a legal pathway for many illegal immigrants to remain and work in the country, has had to straddle the issue since Trump roared to victory on his pledge to root out most of the 12 million undocumented workers and send many of them packing back to their countries of origin.\n\nFor instance, the Wisconsin Republican now says he’s fully in sync with the incoming administration on the need to tighten security along the southern border with Mexico, including building a wall to keep others from crossing into the U.S. He agrees with measures to tighten immigration rules and withdraw federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, like San Francisco and New York that have created havens of security and employment for illegal immigrants and their families.\n\nAnd he is fully on board with policies to step up the arrest and deportation of tens of thousands of dangerous, repeat felons, including some who have been responsible for the violent deaths of U.S. citizens.\n\nBut Ryan has publicly rejected Trump’s earlier calls for mass deportations and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country until the U.S. gets a better handle on domestic terrorism. He also continues to hold out hope for compromise legislation that would provide legal status to many illegal immigrants, despite conservatives’ complaints that that would be tantamount to amnesty. He said he is working with Trump’s transition team to find a “good, humane solution” for the families protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has safeguarded Villalobos and many others until now.\n\nRelated: Trump Stands Alone Calling for Mass Deportation of Illegal Immigrants\n\nFinally, Ryan has repeatedly doused Trump’s idea to assemble a large federal deportation task force that would swoop down and arrest and detain millions of immigrants – and in the process break up families.\n\nRyan said last night that while “everybody thinks” a federal deportation force is being assembled, “that’s not happening.”\n\n“If you’re worried about some deportation force knocking on your door this year, don’t worry about that,” Ryan counseled Villalobos."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/13/Government-Marks-20-Years-Failure-Balance-Its-Books",
    "text": "The decision by President-elect Donald Trump to stock his administration’s top ranks with people who have no significant experience in government has many experts worried about how well the federal bureaucracy will function under the new leadership. But there is at least one thing that a cabinet made up of Wall Street insiders and businesspeople might be able to do that succeeding waves of career public servants have not: get the federal government to balance its books.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office on Thursday released its annual evaluation of the consolidated financial statement of the federal government, and for the 20th time in a row, dating back to 1997, was unable to offer an opinion on the reliability of the government’s books because of widespread accounting and financial management failures.\n\nRelated: 3 Questions the Senate Needs to Ask Treasury Nominee Steve Mnuchin\n\n(To be clear, there’s no reason to believe the government’s book had been balanced until things suddenly went south in 1997. That was the first year that a GAO audit was required under the Government Management Reform Act of 1994.)\n\n“Given the federal government’s mounting fiscal challenges, it’s essential that it be able to accurately account for its costs, outlays, and assets,” said Comptroller General of the United States Gene Dodaro. “But GAO’s latest audit report on the consolidated financial statements underscores how much more has to be done to provide policymakers with reliable financial and performance data—information that is crucial for the difficult spending decisions that lie ahead.”\n\nThe good news is that, for the most part, auditors know where the biggest problems are: the Pentagon and the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, to a lesser extent, the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOf the 24 different agencies covered under the audit requirements, almost all of them received a “clean” opinion from GAO examiners. However, the Defense Department and HUD “have continuing impediments to receiving a clean opinion on their financial statements” and only one of the several financial statements presented by the Department of Agriculture passed muster.\n\nRelated: Repealing Obamacare Taxes Gives the Super Wealthy $7 Million More a Year\n\nThe biggest offender, as usual, was the Pentagon, with its $600 billion budget. In this year’s audit, GAO found “persistent financial management problems at the Department of Defense.” Other problem agencies, it reported, showed an “inability to account for and reconcile certain transactions, an ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements, and significant uncertainties. These shortcomings hamper the government’s ability to reliably report much of its financial information.”\n\nAnd even when the government can show, definitively, where money is flowing, that’s not always much comfort. The GAO reports that in 2016 the volume of improper payments -- that is, money that was paid out but should not have been, climbed to $144 billion from $137 billion the previous year. Historically, federal agencies have a terrible track record when it comes to recouping money that is paid out improperly, getting back pennies on the dollar.\n\nOther uncertainties that stood in the way of GAO signing off on the consolidated federal report had nothing to do with bookkeeping at individual agencies but were tied to broader uncertainties about the government’s future obligations. Auditors said that they were not confident in the federal government’s own assessment of its long-term fiscal outlook in general and the costs associated with various entitlement programs in particular.\n\n“GAO could not render an opinion on the federal government’s sustainability financial statements due to significant uncertainties surrounding the achievement of projected reductions in Medicare cost growth and a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.” the agency reported.\n\nRelated: Would the Government Work Better If It Moved Out of Washington, DC?\n\nThe report offers a final warning about the future trajectory of government spending.\n\n“GAO continues to be troubled by the long-term fiscal projections in the financial report and those prepared annually by the Congressional Budget Office and GAO, all of which show that, absent policy changes, the federal government’s fiscal path is unsustainable.”\n\nBudget challenges, it said, “could limit the federal government’s flexibility to address emerging issues and unforeseen events, such as financial crises, cyber attacks, or pandemics.”\n\nNext week, GAO will issue the first in what the agencies say will be an annual “review of the federal government’s fiscal health.”"

    "text": "Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, invested last year in a major prescription drug distribution company that over the years has been linked to a deadly nationwide epidemic of opioid abuse.\n\nThe San Francisco-based McKesson Corp., the largest drug distributor in the nation, has been the subject of two publicly disclosed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration actions, according to The Washington Post. The company ultimately paid $163 million in fines in response to allegations that it “failed to report hundreds of suspicious orders for millions of pain pills” from Internet pharmacies and others, The Post reported.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy\n\nPrice, a wealthy orthopedic surgeon who Trump has picked to lead HHS and take a major role in repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, has come under mounting scrutiny by Senate Democrats and public watchdogs for possibly engaging in insider trading for years, a violation of federal ethics law.\n\nPrice bought and sold stock worth more than $300,000 in roughly 40 health care, pharmaceutical, and biomedical companies since 2012, according to a recent analysis by The Wall Street Journal. The Georgia Republican sits on the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, which oversees Obamacare, Medicare, and other government health programs, and he also chaired the Budget Committee until recently.\n\nOver the past several years he has sponsored or co-sponsored 44 bills that potentially could have had an important financial impact on the U.S. health care system, the insurance industry, and drug manufacturers. His stock holdings included Aetna Inc., Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nOn Thursday, Price listed McKesson Corp as one of the 43 stocks he intends to sell as part of a major divestiture of his financial holdings and business interests. That move comes ahead of the Senate hearings into his nomination to lead the nation’s premier health services and research agency -- hearings that likely will extend through mid-February because of the complexity of his case.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nAccording to a list of Price’s stock purchases and sales between 2008 and 2016 compiled by the public watchdog Public Citizen, the Georgia lawmaker invested as much as $15,000 in McKesson on March 17, 2016. Public Citizen early this month formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate suspicious stock trading by Price and Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY).\n\n“Extensive stock trading activity in industries that Price and Collins oversee as congressmen, and unusually good timing and financial benefits of those stock trades, raise red flags about the potential use of insider information,” Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen’s Congress Watch division, said in a statement Jan. 5. “The public information available falls short of hard evidence of insider trading, but the patterns of trading activity certainly warrant further investigation to determine if it occurred.”\n\nCongress and the Obama administration have attempted to come to grips with the problem of the questionable trading practices of lawmakers, with mixed results. In 2012, President Obama signed into law the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act that barred members from using “any non-public information derived from the individuals’ position … or gained from performance of individual duties for personal benefit.”\n\nBut the measure was subsequently weakened under pressure from lawmakers and members of the executive branch.\n\nThe decision by Price to invest in a company like McKesson with such a checkered past is a curious one at best. A spokesperson in Price’s congressional office didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Another spokesperson for Price, Phil Blando, told The Wall Street Journal last month that the conservative lawmaker takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously and has complied with all relevant laws.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Could Actually Hurt the US\n\nMcKesson is notorious among DEA and Justice Department investigators and was part of a network of drug distribution companies that pumped tens of millions of prescription painkillers into rural and suburban communities throughout the country, especially in West Virginia, the Northeast and New England.\n\nIn 2008, for example, the DEA and six states sued McKesson for supplying hundreds of hydrocodone orders to rogue pharmacies, according to CBS. McKesson settled, paying $13 million in fines and promising to better monitor its prescription drug distribution operations.\n\nThe opioid epidemic, fueled by the illegal distribution of powerful painkillers, is tragic.\n\nBetween 2000 to 2015, nearly 180,000 people died of overdoses from prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone and oxycodone as part of one of the worst public health crises the country has faced in decades – one that became a compelling issue during the 2016 presidential and congressional campaigns.\n\nThe number of overdose deaths involving opioids increased from 28,647 in 2014 to 33,091 in 2015, an 8.9 percent rise, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPrice, 62, is one of many wealthy businessmen and investors who have been tapped by the multi-billionaire Trump for starring roles in his new administration. And while Price’s estimated $13 million net worth is considerably less than those of the others, his aggressive investments in health care related businesses over the years has become a subject of concern among Democrats and even some Republicans.\n\nRelated: GOP Cuts in Medicare May Be Next After Dismantling Obamacare\n\n“I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter, or in which I know that a person whose interests are imputed to me has a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter, unless I first obtain a written waiver,” Price stated in a letter yesterday to an HHS ethics official that was reported by Morning Consult.\n\nAccording to the letter, Price will divest from the 43 companies within 90 days of his confirmation, adding that he would not participate “personally and substantially” in any matter involving any of the companies until he has sold his stock or obtained a written waiver from the ethics office.\n\nHe also said he intends to retain a limited partnership interest in an Atlanta-area health care real estate company called Diagnostic Ventures of Roswell LLL, and another venture called RMC3 LLC."

Tillerson, if his confirmation hearings are any guide, is more of a pragmatist than critics on the Democratic side seem to think.\n\nBut if Trump and Tillerson are smart enough to spot a couple of quick, astute moves open to them, they can establish a new policy framework that will make it a great deal easier to cope with the tangled web Obama and his State Department leave behind.\n\nNot coincidentally, the key strategies involve Russia and China.

They already do, indeed.\n\nRelated: Trump Acknowledges Russia Role In U.S. Election Hacking\n\nLet’s look across one ocean at a time:\n\nU.S.–Russian relations. It’s obvious now that Trump faces a brutish battle with some elements of the national security apparatus and the Pentagon that oppose his preference for a neo-détente with Moscow. Trump should stick to his guns; better relations with Russia are the key to too many problems to count.\n\nRemember, Trump’s opponents are the same people who scuttled Secretary of State Kerry’s ceasefire efforts in Syria last year by refusing to work jointly with the Russian military. Now look: Russia, Turkey, and Iran have pushed through a new ceasefire while effectively pushing the U.S. out of the picture.\n\nKerry was startlingly blunt on this point when Charlie Rose interviewed him earlier this week. “Talking to Russia,” as the outgoing secretary put it, is essential to any solution in Syria. That goes for getting beyond the long stalemate in Ukraine, too. And let’s not miss what’s going on in Europe in this connection.\n\nBrexit, weak economies, the migrant crisis, right-wing populism, and a full calendar of elections this year—France, the Netherlands, Germany, probably Italy—are turning the Continent’s gaze inward. It’s losing interest in Ukraine, Crimea, sanctions, NATO, and American-style geopolitics altogether. Obama’s legacy on this score, reflecting a consistently overplayed hand, is a wider Atlantic.\n\nRelated: Trump Train Headed for a Brick Wall in US-Russia Relations\n\nThe takeaway: There’s plenty of work to do across the Atlantic and in the Middle East. A better relationship with Moscow is not the Rosetta Stone, but it can open doors to resolving several problems in need of quick attention.\n\nU.S.–China relations. Team Trump is not wrong to complain there are problems in the trans–Pacific economic relationship. They’re just wrong to put it first on the list. Doing so will exacerbate the two real crises-in-the-making.\n\nFirst, a consensus prioritizing on North Korea was forming in Washington even before the November elections, and it will be waiting for Trump when he occupies the Oval Office. Kim Jong-un’s New Year’s Day announcement that the North will shortly test its first intercontinental ballistic missile more or less forces Trump to choose among the three alternatives now on the table:\n\nTrump can tell the Chinese, “Either you bring Pyongyang into line, or we go to war.” But this alternative is flawed. Washington consistently over-estimates Beijing’s leverage over the North and pushing an ultimatum of this kind risks serious damage to Sino–U.S. ties. More grimly, Pyongyang is capable of destroying significant parts of Seoul in response to direct military intervention. Probability: Low to zero.\n\nTrump can do nothing. In view of Kim’s claim to be testing an ICBM, this takes on a brand-new level of risk. Probability: Again, low to zero.\n\nRelated: China Just Gave Trump a 999-Foot-Long Middle Finger\n\nTrump can swallow hard and revive efforts to negotiate a treaty with Pyongyang. The record of failure is long and awful, but this is now the least bad option. Nobody has yet found anything better than the six-party format structured in the past: It brings the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, and (please note) Russia to the table with the North.\n\nSecond, Trump appears to care more about trade and investment relations than sharpening tensions on security and sovereignty questions. And he is right to suggest it’s time to abandon the Clinton-era principle of good relations at any cost.\n\nBut Defense Secretary Ash Carter dumped a big mess in Trump’s lap by needlessly worsening tensions over policing the South China Sea. This has made time a lot shorter on the security side. Sending an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait this week is merely the latest of Beijing’s signals to this effect.\n\nLet’s hope Trump understands the imperative: It’s time to stop telling the bristly Xi Jinping that the seas off China’s coast are America’s alone to secure. It’s a bankrupt proposition, long, long past its sell-by date.\n\nTrump’s takeaway: Try altering our economic ties with China while focusing attention elsewhere on more urgent areas."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/12/Why-Congress-Headed-Showdown-Trump-Over-Obamacare-Repeal",
    "text": "Suddenly President-elect Donald Trump and some Republican congressional leaders are pulling in different directions in their drive to dismantle Obamacare.\n\nWhile “repeal and replace” was a highly effective campaign slogan that helped the Republicans win the White House and retain control of the House and Senate, it has now become an albatross around the necks of the incoming president and Senate and House GOP leaders.\n\nRelated: Trump Promises To Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nNo one really knows what repeal and replace actually means. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), a major cheerleader for dismantling President Obama’s signature health insurance program, insists the way to go is to repeal the program with a lengthy transition period and then come back with a full blown replacement down the road.\n\nBut that’s not what Trump has in mind. Trump vowed during a press conference at Trump Tower on Wednesday to unveil proposals to repeal and then replace the Affordable Care Act literally within days or hours of each other by next month, after Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), his choice to head HHS, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn the wee hours of Thursday morning, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to formally kick off the process of repealing Obamacare, with two Senate committees required to report back by Jan. 27 with specific language for gutting key provisions of the law, including taxes, premium subsidies and mandates on individuals and businesses. McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that his office will be working with Trump’s new Department of Health and Human Services officials to “craft the way forward” in replacing Obamacare – but that the “first step towards replacement is to repeal.”\n\n“It will be essentially simultaneously,” Trump told reporters in New York. “It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour … And we’re going to get a health bill passed. We’re going to get health care taken care of in this country.”\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has gradually been inching towards Trump’s position, telling reporters earlier this week that Congress would do repeal and replace “concurrently,” rather than “simultaneously,” which would leave the lawmakers with a little more latitude in designing a comprehensive replacement. Ryan also said he was exploring options for including parts of a replacement plan in the budget reconciliation bill approved by the Senate and that awaits House action on Friday.\n\nIn a news conference on Capitol Hill today, the Speaker declared, “I’ve spoken with President-elect Trump probably two times in the last three days on this and [Vice President-elect] Mike Pence was in my office yesterday to discuss this, and we agree we want to make sure that we move these things concurrently, at the same time, repeal and replace.”\n\nTiming is everything in politics, as the saying goes, and Congress and the incoming Trump administration may be on a collision course. If McConnell persuades lawmakers in both chambers to move full steam ahead on repealing Obamacare – with the understanding that a comprehensive GOP replacement would be dealt with later – Trump may be confronted with a repeal-now, replace-later bill on his desk in the Oval Office contrary to what he says he wants.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won’t Be Able to Keep\n\nThe notion of Trump vetoing a bill dealing with Obamacare seems unthinkable at this point, although the president-elect has shown no reluctance to call out or challenge congressional Republicans when he disagrees with them. However, with Trump bearing down on Ryan and McConnell to make good quickly on his campaign pledge to repeal and replace the “disastrous” Obamacare program, the president-elect is more likely than not to get his way.\n\nThe idea once advanced by some veteran GOP lawmakers including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch of Utah that it might take another year or two to fashion a replacement plan now seems out of the question.\n\nYet, Trump, Ryan and McConnell are kidding themselves if they think any permutation of repeal and replace legislation they dream up will have smooth sailing through Congress. That’s especially true amid the growing unease among GOP lawmakers in both chambers about their party overplaying their hand, and in the process triggering a collapse of the health insurance market and stripping millions of Americans of their coverage in the coming year or two.\n\n“Congressional Republicans are like the dog that finally caught the car,” said William Galston, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution and one-time domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. “And the questions that they have tap-danced around for six years are now squarely on the front burner.”\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n“Across party lines, health care experts are sending up rockets of alarm about this destabilization of the entire health care markets that could occur if there is a significant interval between the repeal and the replace,” he added today. “I think that President-elect Trump has much better political instincts than Mitch McConnell does. I think it’s increasingly clear that the momentum has shifted in favor of a much smaller gap between repeal and replace.”\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said yesterday that Trump’s timetable for simultaneous action “seems impossible to me,” and that developing a complex replacement plan could take many months if the new president is serious about changing the law. Because Republicans are using special budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare, McConnell needs to muster a simple majority of 51 votes to ram through repeal legislation.\n\nMcConnell was able just to muster 51 votes on Thursday to pass the preliminary budget action after Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) sided with the Democrats in trying to stop the measure.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nHowever, those rules won’t apply when Congress must do the much more challenging task of drafting sweeping replacement legislation, which must be approved in the Senate by a 60-vote supermajority. When the time comes for that, McConnell will have to seek out a handful of moderate Democrats to push the replacement legislation through. That won’t be easy because Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is unwilling to bail out the Republicans unless they agree to delay repeal while the two sides hash out a bipartisan compromise.\n\n“It is more than possible for Trump and the Republicans to have a decent outline of the major themes of a replacement, but the idea of having a bill that is ready to go is out of the question,” Antos said in an interview. “That’s not just because of the complexity but because of the need for negotiations with Republicans first and then ultimately there will have to be negotiations with Democrats.”\n\n“And all of those negotiations end up changing something or other,” he added."

    "text": "Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs banker, Wall Street investor and Hollywood financier who has been nominated for Treasury Secretary by president-elect Donald Trump, says he will divest sizeable holdings if confirmed.\n\nOn its face, that seems like a selfless and patriotic act. Politico reported yesterday that Mnuchin intends to divest his positions in a portfolio of big-name investments that include Wall Street behemoths Citi, Goldman, and Blackstone, plus AT&T, Berkshire Hathaway, CIT Group, Comcast, General Electric, IBM, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Microsoft and Verizon.\n\nRelated: Trump's Incredibly Wealthy Cabinet: Here's How Much They're Worth\n\nA New York Times story on Wednesday said that an examination of Mnuchin’s 45-page filing with the Office of Government Ethics suggested that the minimum combined value of items on his disclosure form is $166 million.\n\nMnuchin also said he would resign from hedge fund Dune Capital Management and, if confirmed, liquidate his stake in the entertainment finance company RatPac-Dune Entertainment Holdings.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Mnuchin said he would divest his shares in Paulson Advantage LP, a fund run by investor John Paulson that has an enormous position in the two titans of the housing market, government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nMnuchin has a history with Paulson. In 2009, he teamed up with Paulson and other investors, including George Soros, to buy the troubled West Coast bank IndyMac, and then reconstituted it as a financial institution called OneWest. Once turned around – some say ruthlessly -- they made a killing, selling it to CIT Group for $3.4 billion.\n\nOne question the Senate needs to ask Mnuchin is how much of a gain he has realized since he suggested in a Fox News interview on Nov. 30, the day after he was nominated for Treasury Secretary, that the government should get out of the mortgage business by privatizing Fannie and Freddie.\n\nRelated: Trump's Pick for Treasury Sends Fannie and Freddie Shares Soaring\n\nThat sent shares of Fannie and Freddie soaring to their highest levels since September 2014, according to Reuters.\n\nA Dec. 16 story by Bloomberg said that Paulson’s Advantage Fund pared its losses for 2016 from more than 20 percent to 16 percent because of the runup in shares of Fannie and Freddie. Fannie shares were at 3.89 early Thursday afternoon, up from a 52-week low of 0.98.\n\nThe second question the Senate Finance Committee might ask Mnuchin (his confirmation hearing remains unscheduled) is whether his comments about Fannie and Freddie were calculated or off-hand.\n\nThe last question speaks to what The Times called “a financial mystery.” Mnuchin says he will retain control of Steven T. Mnuchin Inc. What is it exactly, and what assets does it hold?"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/12/4-Ways-Trump-s-Conflicts-Interest-Could-Actually-Hurt-US",
    "text": "With the exception of the lawyers he hired to construct it, it’s hard to find any government ethics experts who believe President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to distance himself from the management of the Trump Organization while maintaining his ownership stake is enough to eliminate concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump is signing over management responsibilities for his company to his two adult sons and a Trump Organization executive. He says he is setting up a structure that will allow him to receive only limited information about the performance of the company while serving as president.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President\n\nThe words from the Trump transition team is that the president “can’t have” a conflict of interest as a matter of law, and that Trump is taking extreme measures that he isn’t obligated to take out of a sense of propriety.\n\nBoth of those claims were shot down Wednesday afternoon by Walter Schaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, in a speech delivered at the Brookings Institution. The law that Trump relies on for the claim that presidents “can’t have” conflicts of interest was passed for a narrow purpose, Schaub explained.\n\nWhile the law demands that executive branch nominees recuse themselves from dealing with matters that could affect them personally, “Congress understood that a president can’t recuse without depriving the American people of the services of their leader. That’s the reason why the law doesn’t apply to the president.”\n\nNevertheless, he said, “Common sense dictates that a president can, of course, have very real conflicts of interest.” And while Schaub admitted that divestiture would be expensive for Trump, he argued, “It’s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service. He’s going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He’s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.”\n\nRelated: The Simple Fact Trump Is Missing About the ‘Leaked’ Documents\n\nThe potential pitfalls of Trump’s plan are numerous, but here are four of the most serious.\n\n1. Allegations of pay-to-play policies.\n\nTrump has promised to donate all of his profits from money spent by foreign governments at his properties to the U.S. Treasury for the duration of his presidency. Without addressing the bookkeeping nightmare of such a plan, it still doesn’t address concerns that foreign governments -- not to mention domestic and foreign businesses, special interests groups and pretty much anybody with business before the federal government -- will either feel compelled to patronize Trump’s properties or will do so willingly in an effort to curry favor with the Trump administration. It also doesn’t address the value of the prestige that would accrue to the Trump Organization in general if it becomes the brand of choice for international diplomats.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by the Trump administration that favor Trump’s customers rather than American national interests.\n\n2. Questions of regulatory favoritism.\n\nThe Trump Organization will continue to profit from multiple properties and licensing agreements in the United States, all of which fall under the oversight of elements of the executive branch to some degree. That means that any federal workers dealing with a Trump property -- from an Internal Revenue Agency auditor to a workplace safety inspector -- will know that the decision they make could ultimately affect the personal bottom line of their ultimate boss. The problem extends to state government as well. It’s not hard to imagine a governor angling for a large federal grant leaning on state regulatory agencies to go easy on the president’s businesses.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by federal regulators that favor Trump’s businesses rather than American national interests.\n\n3. Law enforcement favoritism.\n\nThe number of times Trump and his businesses have been sued by angry creditors, customers, employees and others is legendary. Some of those lawsuits, like the highly publicized Trump University suit, were heard in federal court. And in the distant past, the Department of Justice brought cases directly against Trump’s company. In an era where federal prosecutors all owe their jobs to the Trump White House, critics could justifiably wonder if any subsequent violations would be treated with the same level of seriousness and impartiality.\n\nThe end result could be decisions made by law enforcement and the courts that favor Trump’s businesses rather than American national interests.\n\n4. Security costs.\n\nAs more than a few people have noticed, Trump tends to put his name on everything, and buildings in dozens of cities and multiple countries around the world currently boast the Trump name and logo. From Trump Tower on down, every one of these facilities could be seen as a potential target for terrorists looking to damage the United States in general and Trump in particular. It’s unclear what Trump’s status as president will mean for their security, but the U.S. taxpayer is already footing the bill for heightened security at Trump Tower in Manhattan. To the extent that this and some of his other commercial properties also require additional protection, critics will be able to ask whether the Trump Organization is receiving a federal benefit because of Trump’s status as president.\n\nThe end result could be higher security costs paid by American taxpayers to protect the Trump Organization’s business interests.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nEthics experts appear to be holding out vain hope that something will change in the coming weeks.\n\n“[T]here’s still time to ... come up with something that will resolve his conflicts of interest,” Schaub said Wednesday. “In developing the current plan, the President-elect did not have the benefit of OGE’s guidance. So, to be clear, OGE’s primary recommendation is that he divest his conflicting financial interests. Nothing short of divestiture will resolve these conflicts.”\n\nFormer Republican White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter said, “The president-elect has nine days to fix this problem.”\n\nBut there is no evidence that the president-elect even views his situation as a problem, and much less that he’s interested in fixing it."

Valuations are stretched. Investors are over their toes, so to speak, with an aggressive bullish position. And sentiment has rarely been higher. Any disappointment could unleash a torrent of pent up selling pressure and cast a pall on Trump's first weeks in office.\n\nRelated: Wall Street Set for Worst Day in 2017 as Trump Trade Fizzles\n\nOn the surface, the situation seems tranquil.

    "text": "When Barack Obama was sworn in as President of the United States in 2009, he put his hand on a Bible and repeated the Oath of Office being clumsily administered by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts.\n\nWhen he pulled back his hand, he was holding what might charitably be described as a bag of elephant dung left for him by his good-natured but bumbling predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nRelated: Obama's Legacy on Corporate Criminals: Too Little, Too Late\n\nAmong the contents of that sack were two wars in far-off lands (one of which was clearly unnecessary); the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression; a health care system that left a significant share of the public without coverage; a broadening gulf between the haves and have-nots that put a laser focus on America’s income inequality; a housing crisis that was foreclosing the dream of home ownership for millions of Americans; the need to bail out the big banks that brought the economy to the brink by greedy, reckless behavior; and the impending demise of the fabled U.S. auto industry.\n\nEight years later, Obama hands his successor the imperfect closure of one war in far-off lands and the failed closure of another; a humanitarian crisis spilling out of Syria; an insanely blood-thirsty band of radical Islamic terrorists (on the run but not defeated); a health system that is troubled but still providing medical care for upwards of 10 million citizens (depending on how you count) previously without coverage; the second-biggest drop in unemployment during a presidency since the New Deal; a housing market well on its way to full recovery; big banks not just stabilized but for the most part thriving; a robust auto industry with an exciting future; and a stock market that has seen the Dow Industrial Average rise from just over 8000 on the day he was inaugurated in 2009 to just under 20,000 today.\n\nPresident Obama may not have been forceful enough in concluding the foreign adventures of Bush and his taciturn handler Dick Cheney. He may have made grave mistakes in not carrying through on threats to the gory regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and in letting Libya erupt into chaos. He may not have done enough fast enough to shut down ISIS. But perhaps we have forgotten how weary America was of ground wars overseas that were sending stretchers of maimed warriors home with lives shattered for no clear reason.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nWhat Obama did domestically, though, was make America much greater on his watch than it was when he took charge.\n\nBut his cool, steady hand is not what we will miss most.\n\nWhat we will miss is what Obama and his First Lady restored to the White House: a level of dignity, grace and style not seen since another young American President presided however briefly over the Camelot Years.\n\nYet even JFK -- who supposedly asked at a post-Inauguration party, “Where are the broads?” – and Jackie did not demonstrate the real set of family values that the Republicans are always babbling about and that Barack and Michelle Obama and their daughters embodied.\n\nYes, Ronald and Nancy Reagan had the dignity, grace and style befitting the highest office in the land, but their example and that of their successors, the Bushes, were more formal, less relatable.\n\nThe Clintons ushered in a trailer-park presidency, and nothing further need be said. And while George and especially Laura Bush were respectful of their roles and were fine parental role models, no one could ever accuse W of grace and style. A goofy charm maybe, but that doesn’t wash the blood off his hands.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President\n\nAnd unlike all of those presidencies, the Obama’s have had no major scandals, no squalid behavior.\n\nAll that must make it achingly depressing to be handing the country over to a successor with all the dignity, grace and style of a boardwalk barker who can’t stop looking at himself in the funhouse mirror. It’s kind of like the Queen being replaced by a lap dancer from Toledo.\n\nStill, there is something encouragingly American about what distinguishes the mixed-race kid with a single Mom from the lucky-sperm-club billionaire with the Tower on Fifth Avenue because it’s something you can't buy: class."

    "text": "The basic laws of supply and demand can easily cause the OPEC production cuts to not work, but there are other factors to also consider. These factors include U.S. shale production, political stability returning to Libya and Nigeria, the amount of oil sitting in storage and rising role of renewable energy.\n\nU.S. shale producers were a leading factor in the 2014 oil crash because of how much oil they brought to domestic and international markets. Since then they have shed billions in unproductive assets and have lowered break-even costs, which means they can quickly start to replace supply that OPEC is attempting to cut. OPEC could be taking a huge risk betting against shale producers.\n\nRelated: As OPEC cuts, traders send European oil volumes to Asia\n\nNo one is as technologically experienced or has such large shale finds ready to be exploited like the U.S. OPEC will need 100% member compliance to ensure shale doesn’t keep oil prices lower than is currently being assumed.\n\nThere are approximately 30 oil-producing U.S states, and with a more energy-friendly incoming administration, pipelines such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access are likely to be approved, leading to increased heavy oil flows from Canada and the Bakken. Has this potentially significant new amount of oil been factored into the production cuts causing prices to rise? It doesn’t seem it has.\n\nLibya is ramping up oil exports after political reconciliations facilitated by the United Nations, and they are exempt from OPEC cuts. In the near-term, Libya could put 700,000 to 900,000 barrels per day on to the market. However, the Libyan government believes they can ramp up production to 1.1 million bpd by the end of 2017, which is a significant amount unaccounted for during this current trading uptick.\n\nThere are still challenges in Libya between the Petroleum Facilities Guard and the Libyan National Army, but even if these tensions endure, significant amounts of oil will be shipped to an already oversupplied European market.\n\nRelated: Oil rises by most in over a month on weak dollar after Trump conference\n\nAnother complicating factor is Nigeria which has been trying to reach some kind of settlement with militants which have been bombing its oil facilities while trying to woo oil majors to raise investment and production. All of their internal problems aside, the African nation still produces around 1.6 million bpd with near-term goal according to President Buhari to reach 2.2 million bpd.\n\nAnother indicator that could put a damper on rising oil prices is the amount of crude currently sitting in storage. The U.S. has roughly 500 million barrels in storage, OECD nations have another 375 million barrels, and China has over 400 million barrels in storage while attempting to expand its reserves to 500 million barrels. At some point investors and the market have to account for this inventory.\n\nThe storage issue is further complicated by Supertankers used for storage. These massive vessels that are now parked from Singapore to Europe are under no obligation to report accurate supplies as well. They can be tracked by satellite and reporting done at docks and ports, but this makes for cryptic and volatile markets. For an investor or interested parties in the OPEC production cuts it should be understood how fast can this crude be sold on the market and how much it could affect prices.\n\nCheating on the production cut quotes by the likes of Iran, Iraq and potentially Saudi Arabia are other influences not being put into consideration by anyone who has a vested interest in oil reaching the $60-70 dollar per barrel range. If OPEC members fail to live up to production quotas, prices might fall much faster than anticipated as supply will continue to outpace demand.\n\nWith the Chinese economy now emphasizing stability over growth, and uncertainty about the growth prospects of the European economy, these large economies are reducing demand growth and this doesn’t bode well for oil prices rising in 2017.\n\nAbovementioned are some of the issues that can cause oil to plateau before even reaching $60 a barrel. Every energy investor and interested party in fossil fuel’s stability wants to see job growth and geopolitical steadiness. Particularly, countries that depend heavily upon higher oil prices to fund their government budgets. Failing to understand the factors that can stall this rally could bring back a 2014 scenario that saw investors, companies and governments lose hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

    "text": "Should President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans make good on their pledge to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the repeal of a handful of tax increases on individuals and businesses and the elimination of a federal tax credit that subsidizes health insurance premiums likely would result in a massive windfall for wealthy households and a financial setback for low and moderate-income people, according to a new study.\n\nIndeed, the 400 highest income taxpayers in the country could receive millions of dollars in tax relief next year while middle and lower income Americans would come up empty or in the hole, according to the report by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nRelated: Trump Promises To Repeal and Replace Obamacare Together, But Can It Be Done?\n\nObamacare is financed by a combination of tax increases on individuals and businesses, Medicare tax increases and cost savings measures, among others. Those taxes – which have long been criticized by Republican lawmakers and special interest groups – potentially could be wiped away if the Republican-controlled Congress moves ahead with plans to repeal Obamacare in the coming month or two, without a clear replacement plan.\n\nThe study released on Thursday focused on two Obamacare taxes that target the wealthiest households in the country but have virtually no effect on middle and lower-income Americans. One is a 0.9 percent federal Hospital Insurance tax increase on individuals with incomes above $200,000 and couples with incomes above $250,000. The other is a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on “unearned income” that wealthy Americans derive from capital gains, dividends and royalties.\n\nThe top 400 highest-income taxpayers -- with average annual incomes of more than $300 million each -- would receive an estimated average annual tax cut of $7 million as part of the repeal, according to the study of Internal Revenue Service data.That would result in a $2.8 billion a year loss in tax revenue to the Treasury.\n\nRoughly 160 million households with incomes below $200,000 would get nothing from the repeal of these two taxes, according to the report.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nMeanwhile, the repeal of Obamacare would effectively raise taxes on about seven million low-and-moderate income families that currently qualify for health insurance premium tax credits under the federal tax code. Those credits, which can be used to purchase private health insurance policies through government-run marketplaces, will be worth on average $4,800 this year.\n\n“The $2.8 billion a year total tax cut for the top 400 . . . is roughly the value of premium tax credits that 813,000 people in the 20 smallest states and Washington, D.C. would lose combined if the ACA is repealed without a replacement,” the study notes.\n\nBefore the advent of the 2010 health reform law, Medicare taxes applied only to wage and salary and self-employment income, and not to unearned income from wealth, according to the study. That meant that low and moderate income families with little if any unearned income felt the brunt of the tax on practically all of their income, while the wealthiest taxpayers owed no Medicare taxes on their hefty dividends and capital gains -- which frequently accounted for a significant share of their total income.\n\n“Repealing the two ACA Medicare taxes, particularly the 3.8 percent tax on investment and other unearned income, delivers tax cuts that are extremely tilted to the top,” the report states. “In fact, the 0.4 percent of households with income of over $1million a year would reap 80 percent of the benefits of repealing these two provisions in 2017.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the Urban Institute last December published an analysis of the effects of Obamacare repeal suggesting that doing away with the law would be a de facto tax cut in and of itself, with the benefits disproportionately going to the wealthy and very wealthy.\n\n“Repealing the Affordable Care Act would cut taxes significantly for the highest income one percent of US households,” wrote Howard Gleckman of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. “At the same time, it would raise taxes on average for low- and moderate-income households.”\n\nThe reports are speculative in part because there is no way of knowing at this point the fate of these tax increases which have been vital in operating the Obamacare program and providing subsidies to many of the 20 million people who take part in the program.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times has reported, it is now dawning on GOP leaders that repealing the dozen or so major Obamacare tax increases along with the premium subsidies for low and middle-income Americans would seriously crimp their effort to devise and finance a substitute health insurance program down the road."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/12/Trump-Bites-Back-Buzzfeed-and-Media-Publishing-Fake-News",
    "text": "Be careful when you fight monsters, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned, lest you become one. That’s advice the editors of Buzzfeed should have heeded. Instead, thanks to the publication of months-old, unsubstantiated opposition research on Donald Trump as supposed serious intelligence, the “fake news” hysteria has come back to bite its original source – and more.\n\nLast November, Buzzfeed did an analysis of the most-clicked Facebook news feed items during the course of the election to argue that “fake news” impacted the election. Craig Silverman claimed that the top twenty “fake news” items got more social-media access than the top twenty “real news” items, even while offering no evidence of the correlation between Facebook clicks and voting behavior, let alone causation.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Hold Countries That Hack and Steal Accountable\n\nThe hypothesis took an even bigger hit from the Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney, who pointed out that the top five in the “real news” category consisted of four liberal opinion pieces and a New York Post story on Melania Trump’s nude modeling in the 1990s.\n\nNevertheless, the mainstream media has continued to hyperventilate about “fake news” even in the absence of any evidence of its impact. Media outlets like The New York Times and the Associated Press have run news articles exposing false stories as part of their pushback on the phenomenon; the latter runs a post-script on those stories as “part of an ongoing AP effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.” Barack Obama even indirectly referenced it in his farewell speech on Tuesday evening, warning that engaging “without some common baseline of facts” was a threat to democracy, following up on other warnings Obama has issued about “fake news.”\n\nAt nearly the same time as Obama delivered that speech, Buzzfeed published a dossier on Donald Trump that it reported had been “circulating among elected officials, intelligence agents, and journalists for weeks.” The memos alleged that Trump’s campaign officials had met with Russian government officials to coordinate efforts, and that Russia had highly damaging personal and financial information on Trump, including a predilection for sexually deviant behavior. It provided more context for a CNN report hours earlier that said US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and Obama on the Russian blackmail threat as well as the alleged contacts between Team Trump and the Russian government.\n\nRelated: Release of Salacious ‘Russian’ Report Further Poisons Trump-Media Relationship\n\nHours later, both stories fell apart. As it turned out, this dossier had floated around media circles for months without anyone biting on it or being able to corroborate it. One key part that alleged contacts between Trump attorney Michael Cohen and Russian agents fell apart almost immediately on publication, as Cohen provided clear evidence that he’d never been in Prague “in his life,” let alone at the time the dossier declared, and that he’d actually been at the University of Southern California with his son that entire week.\n\nTom Brokaw said the next morning that NBC had been unable to verify any of its claims and had decided to drop it after weeks of interest. By late morning, just before Trump held his first press conference as president-elect, NBC News reported that the two-page annex that summarized the documents was intended as a lesson on disinformation, not an assessment of legitimate intelligence.\n\nIn fact, the intelligence briefers had decided not to include that in their presentation anyway. Had they done so, NBC reported, it would have been used to “provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted ‘disinformation.’”\n\nThat certainly put an even more ironic twist on a report from the tip of the spear on “fake news.” Buzzfeed had acknowledged that the report had some obvious errors in it and that it had done nothing to verify its contents – and yet published it anyway.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nIts editor in chief, Ben Smith, e-mailed staff to explain that he “erred on the side of publishing” because the memos were “in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and the media.” The context of that circulation seems to have eluded Smith, however; other media outlets didn’t publish it because it was impossible to verify, and intelligence agencies had it but considered it “disinformation” – which Buzzfeed then made public, doing the damage that intel agencies had wanted to warn against. And almost immediately, the other major media outlets reported on Buzzfeed’s report, exponentially adding to the damage.\n\nWhat gives this “fake news” yet another level of irony is the fact that some of it had been published in the past. David Corn had covered the outlines of the dossier at the far-Left magazine Mother Jones in October without delving too far into the details. Some of the more lurid information from the dossier had been picked up by 4chan in the same time frame, one of the more notorious sources for supposed “fake news.” The allegations didn’t attract much attention at the time despite their lurid and sensational qualities.\n\nThe fever swamps and ideologically driven media didn’t fan this into a flame – it took the mainstream media to do that, and specifically the outlet that first created a nonsensical hysteria about ideologically driven “fake news.” This is almost certainly why other media outlets – especially CNN, whose own story got eclipsed and then damaged – have turned on Buzzfeed and its decision to publish a document whose veracity they barely attempted to validate, other than its existence.\n\nRelated: A New Risk for US Businesses: Being Called Out by Trump\n\nThis episode undermines their credibility on “fake news,” and, perhaps more importantly, their overall credibility on fairness and objectivity when it comes to covering a Republican administration.\n\nThat essentially inoculates Trump from investigative reporting that relies on anonymous sourcing and leaked documents. The public already has deep suspicions about the motives of national media outlets when it comes to Republican political figures, and this example of “fake news” will validate their skepticism.\n\nThat’s not just a crisis for the media, but a potential problem for transparency in governance over the next four years. The mainstream media should stop worrying about “fake news” from fringe outlets and focus more on getting their own stories right. They’ve done far more damage than any Facebook clicks on silly and obvious nonsense could possibly do."

    "text": "It’s hard to avoid paying taxes, but there are usually ways to reduce what you owe. Just ask any company considering a relocation to a different state.\n\nEmployers favor states with more lenient tax structures to promote business growth and attract top-notch workers. But gauging the tax climate in each state is challenging given the many types of taxes, exemptions and complex tax schedules.\n\nNevertheless, the Tax Foundation makes an assessment each year. In its 2017 State Business Tax Climate, the think tank ranks each state by its tax environment. It weighs individual income tax most heavily, followed by sales tax, corporate tax, property tax and then unemployment insurance tax.\n\nSlideshow: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\nA few general themes characterize the best and worst states. The top five states don’t levy at least one major tax — either corporate income tax, the individual income tax or the sales tax. Four have eliminated two major taxes, including top-ranked Wyoming, which has no individual income tax and no sales tax.\n\nAt the bottom, six of the 10 worst states for taxes had the highest property taxes per capita. In general, the states with the worst tax ratings have complicated, progressive taxes with comparatively high rates. New Jersey, ranked last, has the second-highest property tax per capita, and its 7 percent sales tax is tied for second highest in the country.\n\nThis year, the District of Columbia dropped the most from last year’s ranking, falling seven spots, because of changes in its individual income tax structure. The nation’s capital created a new, higher income tax bracket that kicks in at $1 million.\n\nRelated: 8 Changes Coming to Your Taxes in 2017\n\nThe most improved states compared to last year’s ranking were Hawaii and Pennsylvania. In Hawaii, a temporary tax increase expired this year and eliminated the top three individual income tax brackets. The top marginal rate decreased from 11 percent to 8.25 percent as a result, and the state moved up four spots in this year’s ranking.\n\nPennsylvania also rose four slots after the state improved its unemployment insurance tax structure and eliminated its capital stock tax, which was originally slated to expire in 2014 but didn’t until 2016.\n\nClick here to see this year’s full ranking, ranging from the worst (highest) to the best (lowest) tax burdens."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Simple-Fact-Donald-Trump-Missing-About-Leaked-Documents",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump appears to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of a document published by BuzzFeed Tuesday night that purported to reveal that Russia is maintaining a cache of damaging information about him. That misimpression led him, on Wednesday, to suggest that U.S. intelligence agencies had leaked the document in order to hurt him and to compare those agencies to the government of Nazi Germany.\n\nBut there is overwhelming public evidence that the document in question was not under the control of the intelligence agencies at all, raising some serious questions about where of the president-elect is getting his information, and how that will affect his relationship with a key element of the nation’s security services.\n\nRelated: Trump Just Failed His First Ethics Test as President\n\nThe dossier published by BuzzFeed is 35-pages of completely unverified material that suggests Trump has had a long relationship with Russian officials, has received regular intelligence reports from them, has engaged in bribery and favor-swapping, and claims that on more than one occasion Trump engaged in potentially embarrassing sexual activity while in Russia and was caught on film by the Kremlin.\n\nThe information appears to have been compiled by a private security firm in the United Kingdom. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal identified the author as Christopher Steele, a former agent with the British intelligence service. Steele is a cofounder of the London-based Orbis Intelligence.\n\nIt has also been making the rounds among reporters and politicians in Washington for several months.\n\nOn Wednesday, Arizona Sen. John McCain confirmed that he had received a copy late last year. “Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,” he said.\n\nAt least one journalist, Mother Jones magazine’s Washington bureau chief David Corn, had a copy of some of the dossier’s contents as long ago as October. Corn, in an article for the magazine, quoted verbatim parts of the report that appeared in the document BuzzFeed released Tuesday night.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nAll of this strongly suggests that the report has been circulating in the wild for quite some time, well beyond the control of U.S. intelligence services. Trump, however, seems convinced that it was leaked by those agencies as a final attack on him before he takes office. On Twitter Wednesday morning, he raged, “Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?”\n\nIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017\n\nHe reiterated his attack on the U.S. intelligence services during a press conference Wednesday morning.\n\nIn opening remarks, he again suggested that the dossier had been released by U.S. intelligence officials, which he said would be a “tremendous blot on their record ... because a thing like that should never have been written, it should never have been had, and it should certainly have never been released.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked him to clarify his Nazi comparison from earlier in the day, he responded, “I think it was disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information out that turned out to be so false and fake,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s a disgrace,” he repeated. “That’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it’s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.”\n\nRelated: Here’s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nIt is notable that several hours had passed between Trump’s angry 7:48 a.m. tweet and his press conference, which started shortly after 11 a.m. -- more than enough time for people on Trump’s team to correct whatever misimpression the president-elect had about the provenance of the document BuzzFeed published.\n\nApparently, though, nobody did. Or, if they did, their boss ignored them. In either case, he went before the news cameras and doubled down on his claim that the U.S. intelligence officers are similar to the Nazis.\n\nTrump did this at a time when his relationship with the Intelligence Community is already under considerable strain, something that top officials alluded to in Capitol Hill testimony last week. Further exacerbating it could have negative effects on national security.\n\nAdmiral Michael Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, last week told members of Congress that he was concerned about being able to attract and keep talented personnel if they feel their work is not respected or taken seriously by the president."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Trump-Promises-Repeal-and-Replace-Obamacare-Together-Can-It-Be-Done",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to unveil proposals to repeal and then replace the Affordable Care Act literally within days or hours of each other by early next month. He insisted that GOP congressional leaders will have to pick up the pace to demonstrate to Americans that this is a seamless way to achieve the long-promised goal.\n\nDuring his first major news conference since last summer, Trump said that within days of the Senate confirming Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) as Trump’s secretary of health and human services, the new administration will propose specific language for both repealing key provisions of Obamacare and replacing it with a new Republican-style health insurance program.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nRepublican congressional aides say that dismantling the Affordable Care Act would be the easier task and will involve passing a budget resolution protected from a filibuster in the Senate under special budget reconciliation rules. Actually replacing Obamacare with a new health insurance program would be much tougher because Senate Republicans are eight votes short of the 60-vote super majority needed to pass major legislation. That means the Republicans will ultimately need help from the Democrats to push through a replacement.\n\n“It will be essentially simultaneously,” Trump explained to reporters gathered at the Trump Tower in New York. “It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour. … And we’re going to get a health bill passed. We’re going to get health care taken care of in this country.”\n\nTrump offered no clues as to the size, shape or details of a Republican replacement plan, although a number of Republicans including Price, the former House Budget Committee chair, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee chair Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have floated replacement plans. None of these plans have been thoroughly vetted for cost and impact. And none has attracted widespread support within the GOP or among Democrats, whose support will be essential to enacting replacement legislation.\n\nHowever, Trump made it clear in an interview with The New York Times yesterday that congressional Republicans’ plans to repeal Obamacare by late January or early next month but then take as long as two years to enact replacement legislation would be a non-starter with the president-elect.\n\nThe Senate was scheduled to approve a budget resolution by Thursday morning that would begin the process in committee of drafting the details of the repeal legislation -- with a Jan. 27 deadline for completing the work and reporting back to the Senate. Democrats hope to slow the process a little tonight by offering scores of “poison pill” amendments in a marathon “vote-a-rama.” The House will follow suit on Friday with a floor vote to get the ball rolling, and the same deadline for committees to report back with details of the repeal.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won’t Be Able to Keep\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has pledged to bring up the replacement legislation as “quickly” as possible, and Ryan insists that “our goal is to bring it all together concurrently. But that sounds more like wishful thinking than an iron-clad strategy to accommodate an impatient incoming Republican president.\n\nVirtually anyone who knows anything about the way Congress operates understands that replacement legislation of that magnitude takes many months, if not years, to assemble and enact. Even if McConnell and Ryan (R-WI) manage to ram through a budget resolution repealing Obamacare on an expedited basis, drafting replacement legislation that meets the approval of Republican and Democratic rank and file members, insurers and other special interests and the more than 20 million Americans currently covered by Obamacare will be a herculean effort.\n\nIt took President Obama and his Democratic allies nearly two years to negotiate the terms of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Even the repeal part isn’t very easy because you have to think yourself through what provisions you really want to keep and what you can afford to change,” said Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “But replace is so much more complicated. There are layers and layers of policy decisions that have to be made, and they interact with each other.”\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\n“On any given topic, there might appear to be a policy change you want to make, but you have to think yourself through what does that mean for essentially everything else.”\n\nAlthough it all seemed so simple for the Republicans coming off their startling Nov. 8 presidential and congressional election victories, the party since then has been splintering over whether to forge ahead with repealing Obamacare – and possibly stripping millions of Americans of their Obamacare and expanded Medicaid coverage – or move more cautiously. A growing chorus of interests, including the insurance industry, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other health facilities and Republican governors are warning of a dire situation if Congress moves ahead with repeal legislation without any idea of how to replace it.\n\nFive Senate Republicans led by Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker of Tennessee are urging that the leadership wait until March to vote on repealing key aspects of the Affordable Care Act, while a handful of conservative Republicans in the House are also cautioning their party to slow down.\n\nSen. Alexander told reporters he only favors repealing Obamacare once \"there are concrete, practicable reforms in place.\" \"It's not about developing a quick fix,” he said. “It's about working toward a long-term recovery that works for everyone.”\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nDuring his meeting with reporters today, Trump renewed his assault on Obamacare, dismissing it as a “disaster” with astronomical premium and copayment costs that must be dismantled. “The deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, healthcare can’t even be used by them because the deductibles are so high.”\n\nTrump said it would be easy for the Republicans to sit back for another year or two and watch Obamacare continue to implode rather than stepping in to ease the burden of average Americans facing soaring premium costs. “We don’t want to own it politically,” he said of the controversial program. “They [the Democrats] own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in ’17, and believe me, we would get pretty much everything we wanted, but it would take a long time.”"

    "text": "After months of delay, President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday presented his plan to distance himself from his company during his time in the White House. Under the proposal, laid out by an attorney during a press conference with the incoming president, Trump would retain ownership of his company -- including hotels, golf courses, commercial real estate and various branding arrangements -- but would relinquish all management responsibilities.\n\nHe also proposed to donate any profits from his hotels derived from foreign governments directly to the U.S. Treasury in a move meant to silence critics who claim that accepting such payments would be a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.\n\nRelated: Release of Salacious ‘Russian’ Report Further Poisons Trump-Media Relationship\n\nTrump’s press conference came at a contentious moment, after the website BuzzFeed published an unverified dossier suggesting that the Russian government has compromising information about the president-elect, including evidence of illicit financial entanglements and potentially embarrassing sexual activity.\n\nThe publication of the report -- which, again, could not be verified -- plainly enraged Trump and his advisers. During the press conference Trump repeated his claim, aired on Twitter Wednesday morning, that he has no deals, loans or other financial interests in Russia.\n\nWhen he was asked if he would release his tax returns to offer support for that claim, he declined, saying as he has for well over a year now that he cannot because they are under audit. (As many critics have pointed out, there is no law or other requirement that officially prevents a person under audit from releasing his or her returns.)\n\n“The only one that cares about my tax returns is reporters,” he said, shortly before turning the event over to attorney Sheri Dillon, a partner with the law firm Morgan Lewis in Washington.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Hold Countries That Hack and Steal Accountable\n\nDillon said that at Trump’s instruction, she and her colleagues had worked out a plan to “completely isolate him from the management of the company” and to “build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.”\n\nAll of Trump’s investments and business assets will be signed over to a trust by the time he takes office, Dillon said, and he will give up “leadership and management of the Trump Organization” to his adult sons and a senior company executive. His daughter, Ivanka, will also shed all management responsibilities.\n\nTrump will retain sharply limited information rights to his companies, which Dillon described as periodic reports on the profit and loss statement of the consolidated Trump Organization, and not information on individual holdings and business lines.\n\nThe company will also add an “ethics adviser” to its management team, who will be required to approve any new deals made by the company are “beyond reproach and cannot be viewed to be exploitive.”\n\nRelated: How China Can Fight Trump's Trade Policies\n\nShe said that the organization will not do any foreign deals while Trump is in office, but will pursue domestic opportunities. That would appear to violate a promise trump made in December, when he said “no new deals” would be made while he is president.\n\nThe trust Trump is establishing will hold liquid assets like cash and cash equivalents, Treasury securities and possibly mutual fund holdings. It will also hold what Dillon described as “pre-existing, illiquid and very valuable business assets.” That includes golf resorts, hotels, rights to royalties, etc.\n\nDillon said that after his election, Trump ordered the termination of 30 pending deals, which caused an immediate loss of millions of dollars.\n\nEthics experts have argued that the only way to truly remove conflicts of interest in Trump’s case would be total divestiture of his assets. However, Dillon argued, selling everything would be both impractical and rife with its own conflicts. For example, selling the business would immediately create questions about whether the price paid was fair.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Too Impulsive to Be President? 58% of Americans Think So\n\nFurther, selling the companies while retaining royalty rights to the Trump name would mean Trump retained an interest in the brands, but no ability to prevent it from being used to exploit his position. Stripping the Trump name from the company, she said, would vastly diminish its value, leading to a “fire sale.”\n\nDillon pushed back hard against claims that Trump will violate the emoluments clause if he profits from payments that foreign governments make to his hotels. She insisted that the clause does not apply to fair value exchanges.\n\n“Paying for your hotel is a value-for-value exchange” and “is not an emolument.” she said. That is a position that many ethics experts hotly dispute, but Dillon said Trump will try to make the question moot with his promise to redirect money from foreign governments to the Treasury.\n\nHe will, she said, “voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments to his hotels to the U.S. Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.”\n\nRelated: Five Moves That Can Help Trump Win Big on Day One\n\nGovernment ethics experts were extremely critical of Trump’s plan, insisting that nothing short of total divestment would truly eliminate conflicts of interest.\n\n“Today was his first test as president. He failed,” said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\n“He’s not worried about conflicts of interest because the statutes don’t apply to the president. If that sounds familiar, it was the position Nixon took when he told David Frost ‘when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.’ Just because it’s not illegal, does not mean it is right or moral.”\n\nAll of Trump’s decisions as president, Bookbinder said, “will be followed by the specter of doubt, and will be questioned as to whether his decision is in the best interest of the American people or the best interest of his bottom line.”\n\n“Trump’s proposals today make decent sound bites, but, in reality, fall short of meaningfully solving the problem,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. “Retaining ownership and allowing his children to operate the family business is a page out of the Corruption 101 Handbook.”\n\nThe plan, Brian said, “will likely embroil Trump in controversy and litigation.”"

    "text": "Many assert that President-elect Donald Trump is against free trade. But standing against the theft of intellectual property and old-fashioned mercantilism, as Trump has promised to do, is an appropriate role for the chief executive. Allowing other countries to cheat us is not free trade.\n\nAmerica consistently outperforms the rest of the world in the sphere of intellectual property. People throughout the world identify with American art, music, software, and clothing designs, and benefit from American pharmaceuticals and patents.\n\nRelated: Trump and Sanders Lash Out at a Common Enemy: Free Trade\n\nYet American intellectual property is routinely stolen. Each year, the United States Trade Representative publishes a report entitled “Special 301 Report” on intellectual property theft—yet does nothing about it.\n\nThis year Algeria, Argentina, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, and Venezuela are the 11 countries on the “Priority Watch List.” USTR has “the most significant concerns regarding insufficient [intellectual property rights] protection or enforcement or actions that otherwise limited market access for persons relying on intellectual property protection.” Another 23 countries are on a “watch list.”\n\nMost of the same countries are on the “priority watch list” year after year. China and several other countries have been on the list for many years. There is no credible punishment from stealing American intellectual property, so countries continue to do it. Theft pays.\n\nIntellectual property is stolen when American corporate employees are thrown in prison or harassed in a government shake-down, or when American companies are hauled into foreign courts and accused of stealing their own patents. Sometimes American Internet companies are kicked out a country that fosters its own imitative companies to displace the American ones. In other places, pharmaceuticals are manufactured without license. And by now everyone knows about foreign hackers invading American websites.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nAmerican businesses have grown inured to intellectual property theft. They expect theft in countries around the world and they cannot fight back because they risk being banned from lucrative markets. The combination of theft and no enforcement reinforce one another, and our government needs to respond.\n\nIt is not just American businesses that lose, it is also American creators. Millions of Americans create and promote intellectual property.

Pirate countries have little if any incentive to respect our property. The wonder is not that some countries steal our intellectual property; the wonder is that all countries do not steal our intellectual property given the weakness of our response.\n\nCountries may tell us that it is impossible for them to prevent their citizens from copying our goods. But when China, for example, can make book publishers in Hong Kong disappear because it disagrees with the content of the books, it can certainly close down the fake Apple stores.\n\nRelated: How China Can Fight Trump's Trade Policies\n\nAmerica should take a tough line with countries on the USTR’s Section 301 Priority Watch List. Here are five suggestions.\n\n1. We could limit their commercial activities in the United States. Alternatively, we could limit imports of those products with their intellectual property—or ours.\n\n2. When an American company is being harassed in a foreign country, we could haul the ambassador in and ask what is going on. If China holds up our imports, we could hold up their imports.\n\n3. If the country is on the special watch list, the Commerce Department could request the International Trade Administration do audits of intellectual property protection in those countries.\n\n4. We could limit, and not expand, the commercial activities of countries on that watch list.\n\n5. If a country appears for a second year on the list, the Commerce Secretary could be required to prepare a special report to the President on remedial actions.\n\nOur government should be proudly standing up for our companies. It is not free trade when other countries steal our products. And retaliating against theft does not violate the principles of free trade."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Obama-s-Final-Challenge-GOP-Create-Better-Health-Care-Plan-and-I-ll-Support-It",
    "text": "In his eloquent, nearly one-hour long farewell speech to America Tuesday night, President Obama made just a passing reference to the Affordable Care Act, his signature health care program now under relentless attack by congressional Republicans and his successor, President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of 20,000 adoring supporters at the McCormick Place convention center in his hometown of Chicago, Obama noted that the nation’s uninsured rate has “never, ever been lower,” health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years, and – for all its problems –Obamacare’s detractors have not yet been able to come up with a better idea as a replacement that can cover more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nIn what seemed like a challenge to Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Obama said that “If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we’ve made to our health care system – that covers as many people at less cost – I will publicly support it.”\n\nWith just 10 days remaining before he relinquishes the White House, Obama sought to celebrate the achievements of his eight years in office while asserting the need for Americans to vigilantly guard their democratic rights and principles. The clear and present danger, he said, is for Americans to succumb to xenophobic fears, racial and religious prejudices and poisoned rhetoric.\n\n“Democracy can buckle when we give into fear,” Obama said. So while the nation must remain vigilant, he added, “We must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who were are.”\n\nThe speech was less of a State of the Union-style recitation of his accomplishments than a summoning of the spirit of a badly demoralized Democratic Party. The Democrats suffered one of their worst drubbings in the Nov. 8 election, essentially solidifying Republicans’ control of the Senate and House while losing the presidency.\n\nDespite his numerous setbacks on the domestic and foreign front – with many of his environmental and regulatory initiatives tied up in court and his strategy for dealing with the civil war in Syria and the Middle Eastern hot spots in shambles – Obama couldn’t resist recalling some of the victories, especially his success in pulling the country out of the worst financial crisis and recession in modern history.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won’t Be Able to Keep\n\n“If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history ... If I had told you we would open a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran’s nuclear weapons without firing a shot and take out the mastermind of 9/11 ... you might have said our sights were set a little too high.”\n\nHowever, he had almost nothing to say about the Affordable Care Act – his centerpiece domestic legislation that is likely to define his legacy more than any other program. More than six years after Obama and the Democrats enacted the program without a single GOP vote in the House or Senate, the program remains highly controversial with the public at large.\n\nPolls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans don’t approve of the legislation, although most would prefer to see the program fixed instead of repealed. While the program was highly ambitious and addressed a real need for millions of families that have struggled without coverage for years, Obamacare suffered a disastrous, glitch-filled on-line launch four years ago. One problem was that the plan didn’t match its promises -- including Obama’s pledge that beneficiaries could keep their doctors, there would be plenty of insurance options and that premiums and copayments would be highly affordable.\n\nEven while millions of people subsequently benefitted from the subsidized private health insurance plans sold on government-run markets or expanded Medicaid coverage in 31 states and the District of Columbia, the coverage turned out to be a lot more costly in many areas of the country, nearly two dozen experimental insurance co-ops went out of business and major insurers including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross-Blue Shield pulled out of the program following losses of tens of millions of dollars.\n\nRelated: Most Americans Don’t Want to Repeal Obamacare: Here’s What They Want Instead\n\nFrom the very start, Republicans – goaded on by McConnell and former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio – denounced Obamacare and staged a series of more than 50 votes over the years to try to repeal the legislation. Rather than seeking to work with the Democrats to fix some of the more glaring problems with the program, they demanded to eviscerate Obamacare and replace it with a less ambitious, more market-oriented program.\n\nMcConnell’s take-no-prisoners approach to health care, in which he kept the Republicans united in opposition to Obamacare and sought to thwart the rest of the president’s agenda, proved to be a fateful pivot that impacted Obama’s administration and the Democrats’ political fortunes for the remainder of his time in office.\n\nOr as Mike DeBonis of The Washington Post wrote Wednesday, it was the point at which “the audacity of hope gave way to the reality and frustrations of divided government.” Obama would subsequently sign one more major piece of legislation – the Dodd-Frank financial reform law – and a fiscal stimulus to try to revive the economy. But after that, the Democrats lost control of the House and the last six years in office were focused largely on budgetary disputes with Congress over spending levels and the debt ceiling.\n\nBy the last year of his administration, DeBonis noted, Obama’s party had lost 14 Senate seats, 68 House seats, 12 governorship and hundreds of state legislative seats.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nNow, on his way out the door, Obama is being treated to the spectacle of House and Senate GOP leaders rushing to repeal Obamacare in the coming weeks, even without a solid replacement plan in hand. The Senate and House are scheduled to take the first important votes towards that end later this week. And by the end of the month, the GOP-dominated Congress may give final approval to legislation that would dismantle most of the key elements of Obamacare, although the effective date may be months or years away.\n\nIf Obama can take any solace from the situation, McConnell and Ryan are discovering that repealing and replacing Obamacare isn’t nearly as easy as they thought. Now a growing number of Republicans in the House and Senate are having second thoughts about the effort, fearing a voter backlash if their efforts result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance and major insurers and hospitals incurring significant financial losses."

    "text": "Any hope that today’s long-awaited press conference with President-Elect Donald Trump would signal a return to normalcy in the relationship between the incoming administration and the media was dashed last night by the surprising decision by BuzzFeed’s news division to publish an unverified (and, as the website notes, potentially unverifiable) document containing a raft of allegations against the incoming president.\n\nThe information, gathered by a foreign intelligence operative who was evidently paid by Trump’s opponents in the Republican presidential primary, contains allegations that the Russian government has for years been seeking to gain influence over the President-elect. The methods included the provision of intelligence, offers of lucrative business deals, and most shocking, the filming of compromising sexual activity.\n\nRelated: Looks Like Flynn Is Manipulating Trump on Russia. Where’s His Pink Slip?\n\nSome of the details in the document are clearly incorrect, including a false characterization of a Moscow neighborhood, and misspellings. It also claims that Trump attorney Michael Cohen met with Russian intelligence officials in Prague. Cohen, on Tuesday evening, took to Twitter to deny the charge, saying that not only had the meeting never taken place but that he has never been to Prague in his life.\n\nIt can’t be stressed enough that the material in the dossier published by BuzzFeed could all be fake. Versions of it have been floating around government and media circles in Washington since last year, and until now, no news organization -- including the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, which is adamantly opposed to Trump -- had felt comfortable publishing the information it contains.\n\nThat changed last night after CNN reported that Trump himself had been briefed on the dossier by top intelligence officials as part of his meeting with them on Friday. The news network did not reveal the explicit details of the allegations, which it said had also been presented to President Obama.\n\nThe long-term impact of the publication of the dossier is impossible to assess at this point. The allegations will become the subject of intense media investigation and speculation. It seems probable that US law enforcement and intelligence services are also probing its claims, though Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey declined to comment on the existence of such an inquiry in a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday.\n\nRelated: Five Moves That Can Help Trump Win Big on Day One\n\nBut it’s not hard to predict the impact that the revelation will have on Trump’s already toxic relationship with the media. The incoming president attacked the report on Twitter Monday night, writing “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!”\n\nOn Wednesday morning, he was back at it, citing official Russian denials of a campaign to gain influence over him. “Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is ‘A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.’ Very unfair!” he wrote.\n\nLater, he added, “Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!”\n\nTrump, as of early Wednesday, was still expected to appear at an 11 a.m. press conference, his first since July. Whether or not it will happen, given the circumstances, was in question. Indeed, Trump has previously announced press conferences that either never materialized or wound up being extended campaign events at which no actual questions from the media were taken.\n\nBut if Trump does take questions from the press, it seems likely that the vast number of pressing questions about his impending presidency -- his conflicts of interest, his policy agenda, the role of his family members, the inexperience of his cabinet nominees -- will now take a back seat to the allegations raised in the dossier released last night.\n\nThat’s a shame because barring substantial corroboration, those allegations will only serve to deepen the impression held by Trump and his strongest supporters that the media is biased against him and untrustworthy. As a result, it will color public perception of future critical reporting about the Trump administration.\n\nExpect to hear the “FAKE NEWS” claim a lot in the weeks to come, whether justified or not."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/11/Trump-Too-Impulsive-Be-President-58-Americans-Think-So",
    "text": "Just ten days before President-elect Donald Trump is handed the keys to the White House and the nation’s nuclear weapons code, more than half of voters fret that he is too impulsive to make level-headed decisions for the country according to a revealing new survey.\n\nAfter being treated to the spectacle of a Republican president in waiting virtually dominating the world stage, discrediting the U.S. intelligence community’s findings about Russian interference with the election, intimidating car manufacturers, filling his new Cabinet with business moguls, and even bad-mouthing legendary Hollywood star Meryl Streep, Americans are largely on edge as the Jan. 20 inauguration fast approaches.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Are Hitting the Brakes on Obamacare Repeal\n\nFifty-eight percent of Americans said that when it comes to making important decisions, Trump will be “too impulsive,” while 34 percent think he will be “about right” and a mere four percent think he will be “too cautious,” according to a new Pew Research Center poll released on Tuesday, the day before Trump holds his first full-blown news conference since late July.\n\nIt’s no surprise that voters continue to be troubled by his demeanor, in light of his frequent outbursts and petulant comments. Long after his stunning defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump continues to use Twitter to hurl biting, 140-character darts at critics, opponents and even GOP allies at times.\n\nThroughout the campaign, voters voiced concerns about Trump’s temperament, even as many were drawn to his policies and promises. Last October, for example, 69 percent of voters surveyed characterized Trump as “reckless” while 65 percent said he had “poor judgment.”\n\nIn the latest Pew survey conducted nationally Jan. 4 through 9, Americans as a whole continued to worry about his temperament, although Republicans are obviously far more trusting of Trump to behave properly than Democrats.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won’t Be Able to Keep\n\nOverall, 65 percent of Republicans said they think Trump’s approach to making important decisions will be about right, according to Pew, while 28 percent fear he will be too impulsive. By contrast, an overwhelming 84 percent of Democrats are convinced Trump will be too impulsive, and just nine percent think his approach and style will be about right.\n\nTrump is certain to be peppered by reporters today on a multitude of questions, including how he and family members who will either be handling his business interests or advising him in Washington can avoid major conflicts of interest. Just this week, Trump announced that he is hiring his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a real estate businessman in his own right, as a senior adviser in the West Wing.\n\nCNN reported late Tuesday that classified documents presented last week to President Obama and Trump included allegations that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” Trump is certain to be questioned at length about the controversy over Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.\n\nReporters also are likely to press Trump to explain precisely what he has in store for the country in terms of new immigration policy and a crackdown on illegal immigrants, big changes in the health care system, new trade policies and his plans for beefing up U.S. defenses and the nuclear arsenal. Many Americans are keenly interested in what Trump will have to say about these and other issues, according to the new survey.\n\nRelated: You Wanted a Woman President – You Got One!\n\nAmericans disapprove of the job Trump has done since the election in explaining his future plans, with 55 percent saying they disapprove and 39 percent saying they approve, according to the Pew survey.\n\nThere is also widespread concern about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in running the country while his family-owned businesses, hotels, and country clubs could be helped or by future government tax and regulatory policies. Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed said they are very or somewhat worried about conflicts of interest, according to Pew, while 42 percent indicated they were not particularly concerned.\n\nSome 60 percent said that Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns, a move that would give the public insight into his business dealing in the U.S. and overseas and determine whether he was honest in boasting of making generous charitable contributions. Thirty-three percent said they didn’t think Trump was obliged to release his tax returns. Trump has insisted that he is unable to release his tax returns because they are the subject of an IRS audit. The president-elect’s critics say that is a bogus excuse and that he could release the returns if he wanted to."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/11/Five-Moves-Can-Help-Trump-Win-Big-Day-One",
    "text": "Half the country is excited about President-elect Donald Trump; half is not. What can he do to win over more Americans? Simple; charge out of the gate on January 21 with a bevy of policies that voters will like.\n\nHere are five things Trump should do on Day One:\n\nCall for term limits in Congress.\n\n\n\nWalk away from the TPP.\n\n\n\nCall for a halt to admitting Syrian refugees until the authorities have the vetting process down cold.\n\n\n\nIssue an executive order rescinding Congress’ exemption from Obamacare, an excellent idea proffered by Heather Higgins, President of the Independent Women’s Voice. As she suggests, there’s nothing like skin in the game to light a fire under legislators. Next, announce that Congress will repeal Obamacare to take effect December 2018. Meanwhile, allow insurers to immediately begin offering state-legal policies without the ACA’s expensive and unwieldy mandates. Make it clear that no one will lose coverage.\n\n\n\nApprove the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nFor soon-to-be President Trump, there is no single act that could more swiftly satisfy his pledge to “Drain the Swamp” than calling for term limits. Ethics watchdogs say that nothing is a greater predictor of corruption than time in office. Former Representative Chaka Fattah, recently sentenced to ten years in prison for bribery and corruption, is a perfect example.\n\nHe has served for 20 years. The longest sentence ever awarded a member of Congress was the 13-year term given to Louisiana’s William Jefferson in 2009 after $90,000 was discovered in his freezer. He had served for 18 years. In the 2012 listing of Most Corrupt House members by left-leaning ethics watchdog CREW, the average time in office was eight terms. That’s too long to feed at the public trough.\n\nA Rasmussen poll in October found that 74 percent of the country backed term limits for members of Congress; in 2013, Gallup concluded that 75 percent of Americans felt the same way. Our founding fathers never imagined “career politicians,” and we should not accept the notion either.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership multi-nation trade pact, proposed and endorsed by President Obama, has been attacked from right and left. Indeed, denouncing the TPP may have been the only policy that Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton (after some persuasion) and Bernie Sanders all agreed upon.\n\nPolling from Pew and a YouGov survey for The Economist shows that most registered voters also oppose the TPP. To explain why he is scuttling the deal, Trump can cite a comprehensive World Bank study -- one of the few done on the pact -- which concludes that Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia will be the big beneficiaries of the agreement. The benefits to the U.S. are described as “limited.” Much better, Trump can assert, to craft bilateral deals that can actually help the U.S.\n\nAs for NAFTA, Trump should promise that negotiations to overhaul the agreement will be initiated in his first year. That 1993 deal is woefully out of date; e-commerce, for instance, is not even mentioned. But, jettisoning NAFTA immediately is not feasible. Too many supply chains run across our borders; reckless tinkering would undermine numerous industries. Lofting uncertainty onto U.S. businesses as the Obama White House did was a major factor in slowing the recovery. Trump will not repeat that mistake.\n\nIn 2015 Donald Trump was pilloried for advocating “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,\" a position he took in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings. After reports that Syrian refugees may have been behind terror attacks in Europe, Trump refined his proposal, suggesting we should \"suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies.” In other words, Trump opposed President Obama’s plan to admit at least 10,000 refugees from Syria, a goal the White House exceeded last year.\n\nPolling after the Paris terror attacks showed more than half the country agreed with Trump. A more recent survey, taken by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, showed that only 36 percent of the country backed settling Syrian refugees on our soil.\n\nTrump should suspend the program to admit refugees from war-torn countries until our intelligence agencies can prove their ability to truly “vet” newcomers from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. The United States can and should do more to help settle these struggling peoples in other countries in the Middle East; there is no reason to import trouble.\n\nHaving pledged to do so, Trump and Republicans in Congress must immediately address Obamacare. On day one, President Trump should support the repeal, but push the effective date to the end of 2018. Congress will be instructed to recraft the failing program in the interim, allowing for more market-based solutions, reducing Obamacare’s costly and absurd mandates and allowing religious groups more flexibility in providing controversial coverage. Trump must make it clear that no one will lose his health coverage, that the needy will be able to access care and that the changes will target lower costs. He has already promised to keep the popular parts of the ACA, which allow children to stay on their parents’ program and which guarantee coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nFinally, Trump will approve the Keystone Pipeline. A majority of the country backs the pipeline, which has been reviewed ad nauseum, and which will create jobs. Even Obama’s State Department could find no authentic reason to oppose it. Trump will let this valuable conduit to one of the world’s largest energy reserves move forward. Even Canada’s progressive new leader Justin Trudeau has supported Keystone. This is a slam-dunk.\n\nConsumer optimism just hit a twelve-month high. Imagine what this Day One program would do."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/10/Would-Government-Work-Better-If-It-Moved-Out-Washington-DC",
    "text": "Republicans have long are campaigned on their dislike of Washington, criticizing everything “inside the beltway” as corrupt or antithetical to freedom. But Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, has done his colleagues one better. The Utah Republican is proposing to move Washington itself outside the beltway.\n\nAs part of a proposal that is described as “the first step in a process to bring government closer to the people by evaluating which agencies might better serve their purpose elsewhere,” Chaffetz on Tuesday introduced H.R. 38, the Divest DC Act.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes in 2017\n\n“Government needs to be closer to the people it regulates,” he said in a statement. “As it stands, decision makers at various agencies are largely shielded from the impact of their decisions. Housing federal agencies in a city with one of the highest median incomes in the United States is not only expensive, but keeps federal bureaucrats in an economic and political bubble that offers a distorted view of the realities facing this country.”\n\nHe continued, “This resolution is the first step toward decentralizing federal agencies and initiating a process that shares the wealth of stable federal jobs with other communities across the United States. I look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation to identify locations where these agencies can best serve the American people.”\n\nThere are, to be sure, a few impediments to shipping the Commerce Department to Kalamazoo and sending the Pentagon to Peoria. The first is whether or not it’s wise to think about abandoning the Washington-based infrastructure that the federal government has created for itself over hundreds of years. Employees of different parts of the executive branch frequently meet with each other, and that’s much easier to do when it doesn’t involve flying across the country.\n\nAnother is whether or not such a proposal could survive the sustained assault of the lobbyists, government contractors, law firms and others who have grafted themselves so completely to D.C. and the surrounding suburbs over the generations and who would be loath to decamp for somewhere else.\n\nFinally, though, is the question of whether a greatly decentralized federal government would be able to attract the kind of talent it needs to operate effectively. Part of what attracts many young, smart people to federal service is that Washington is a cosmopolitan place with lots of social, cultural and other opportunities for a wide range of people. The same can’t be said for all parts of the country.\n\nRelated: The 9 States (and One District) Americans Are Flocking To\n\nChaffetz’s proposal is, in the end, not likely to lead to an actual restructuring of the federal government. But like many pieces of legislation introduced in Washington, then Divest Act is more about symbolism than about actual policymaking.\n\nIt’s a way to win points with conservative voters, and to raise questions about whether the federal government is in touch with the needs of the people. And neither of those requires any real action from lawmakers at all."

She won’t hold a Cabinet-level position. In fact, she didn’t even run.\n\nBut if you close your eyes and just listen to TV news and talk shows on CNN, Fox and elsewhere, or keep track of the traffic on Twitter, you might be excused for thinking that America elected Kellyanne Conway as its first woman president.\n\nRelated: The Most Powerful Woman on Team Trump (Hint: It’s Not Ivanka)\n\nLike the dude who did get elected president, her boss Donald Trump, Conway is a Twitter addict.\n\nLike the man whose campaign she helped salvage, Conway revels in blood-sport politics – the give and the take, the gotcha moments, the incessant spinning – even if at times logic escapes her and repetition is her only friend.\n\nLike the attention hog she explains, covers for and attempts to extricate from mud holes of his own making, Conway is all about the hair and seems partial to extreme makeup.\n\nShe is not going to be Chief of Staff in the Trump White House. That’s the job of outgoing GOP National Chairman Reince Priebus, a professional explainer and apologist steeped in the ways of the Republican Establishment.\n\nShe is not going to be Press Secretary. That would be Priebus protégé, Sean Spicer.\n\nRelated: Kellyanne Conway Doesn’t Want Any More ‘Mean’ Questions About Donald Trump\n\nShe is not even going to be communications chief. That job was going to Jason Miller, but he begged off after an alleged affair with another member of the transition team was revealed.\n\nInstead, largely of her own choosing, Conway will be Counselor to the President. But that nebulous title doesn’t begin to describe the depth of her power.\n\nIf the Trump campaign and transition were war zones, Conway would be G.I. Jane, assault weapons in each hand and bandoliers of bullets crisscrossing her chest, always at the barricades, frequently on the offensive and when need be, willing to take no prisoners. She is the combat platoon leader.\n\nWith Trump, who hasn’t held a news conference since July, so far restricting himself to 140-character barrages on Twitter and hurried interactions with the “dishonest media” in the lobby of Faulty Tower as he photo-ops with this dignitary or that business mogul or more likely some sycophantic pol looking for work, Conway sometimes seems like the battlefield general, too.\n\nWhen failed 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney came low crawling to Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey, thinking that even after trashing the GOP nominee for months he might be considered for Secretary of State, the president-elect appeared to be gracious and forgiving though he may have been just toying with Mr. Perfect.\n\nRelated: Trump Campaign Star Conway Named as His Presidential Counselor\n\nNot Conway.\n\nIf Romney ever had a prayer of being a waiter in the White House Mess, Conway dropped a platter of dirty dishes on his head in a series of Sunday talk show appearances. That led to a round of criticism for seeming to overstep her pay grade, but she didn’t back down, and the un-chosen Romney would up looking like a well-heeled fool.\n\nPerhaps she was just being a loyal acolyte of Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire’s daughter who brought her into the Trump campaign and first emerged as a Republican player in late 2012 with a post-defeat takedown of Romney, as The Washington Post reported in a prescient profile.\n\nBut whatever her path to power, Conway now appears to be a force unto herself. And clearly, she relishes her day in the sun.\n\nSometimes Conway meets her match, as she did in a face-off with Chris Cuomo of CNN last week when he pressed her on Trump’s reluctance to concede that Russia was involved in attempting to disrupt the American presidential election (he has since accepted the conclusions of U.S. intelligence).\n\nRelated: Why Kellyanne Conway Was Right About Romney\n\nBut for the most part, Conway is informed, unafraid and unapologetic when she tangles with the media.\n\nAnd unlike the incoming Commander-in-Chief who can force a smile but rarely seems to laugh, Conway has a sense of humor.\n\nOn Sunday, she re-tweeted a post she called “Best tweet ever.” It was a reference to the Giants’ defeat at the hands of the Green Bay Packers in an NFL wild-card game. It read: “Odell Beckham Jr. Hillary Clinton. Neither showed up in Wisconsin.”\n\nNow that’s funny."

    "text": "House and Senate GOP leaders are encountering increasingly stiff political headwinds in their drive to repeal the Affordable Care by the end of the month, as influential Republicans in both chambers press to delay final action until President-elect Donald Trump and party leaders can reach a consensus on a workable replacement plan.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have been adamant that the two chambers forge ahead with floor votes and committee work that would culminate in a final vote by the end of January or early February – regardless of whether the Republicans and Trump are able to cobble together a replacement plan at the same time.\n\nRelated: 5 Big Promises Trump Won’t Be Able to Keep\n\n“We’re acting quickly because Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, and things will continue to get worse otherwise,” McConnell said in a Fox News op-ed. “That doesn’t mean the law will end overnight. There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed, we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now.”\n\nBut some prominent Republican senators and a substantial faction of House GOP conservatives are balking at the leadership’s hasty action, a sudden development that could sidetrack the leadership’s ambitious plans to dismember Obamacare.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers fear that in their rush to make good on a campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, Trump, and the GOP leadership might end up triggering a chaotic situation in which tens of millions of Americans lose their coverage in the coming year or two while major insurers and hospitals incur huge financial losses as the Obamacare markets crumble.\n\nTrump on Tuesday stepped up pressure on Republicans to move ahead with a repeal of Obamacare and then adopt a replacement shortly thereafter. “We have to get to business,” Trump said. “Obamacare has been a catastrophic event.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nHis latest declaration on the subject clearly undercut those in his party who say it could take many months or even years before a full-blown replacement program can be agreed upon and phased in. Even the most optimistic of Republicans, including Ryan, have indicated it could take until the end of the year to strike an agreement on a major health insurance bill to replace Obamacare.\n\n“Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan.”\n\nRepublicans hold a relatively narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate. Because of the special budget reconciliation rules that are being used, the leadership needs only a simple majority of 51 votes to pass the budget resolution, instead of the usual 60-vote supermajority. But if the leadership suffers the defection of just three Republicans, the Obamacare repeal effort could collapse.\n\nTrump and the Republicans rode to victory in the 2016 election blithely promising to repeal and replace Obamacare as one of their first acts. Now, in the harsh light of day, the GOP victors are struggling to figure out how to make good on that promise without prompting a voter backlash from millions of Americans who could lose their current subsidized insurance or extended Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nUnderscoring that dilemma for the GOP, a new Morning Consult/Politico poll released Tuesday found that nearly two-thirds of voters say the Republican-controlled Congress should not repeal Obamacare without having a replacement plan in hand.\n\nWhile Republicans typically have voiced much stronger feelings than Democrats for the need to dismantle Obamacare in short order, the new poll found that 48 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents said there should be a “clear alternative announced” before repealing the 2010 health care law.\n\nA Gallup poll conducted shortly after Trump’s surprising November 8 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton found that while more than half of Americans were dissatisfied with Obamacare, 57 percent said they either wanted to keep the law as is or wanted to keep it and change the law significantly. Little more than a third said they wanted to repeal and replace it as the Republicans have vowed to do.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to take the lead with a vote on Thursday to formally launch the budget “reconciliation” process and put repeal of Obamacare on a fast track by ordering the Finance Committee and Health, Education and Labor Committees to report back with final repeal language by Jan. 27.\n\nThe House appears set to vote on a similar budget resolution Friday that instructs the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees to draft language and report back by Jan. 27. The House vote originally was scheduled for next week, but it’s possible the leadership decided to move up the vote before any internal party resistance began to gel.\n\nOnce the GOP leadership resolved differences in the two resolutions, the House and Senate would then vote on the final resolution targeting key elements of Obamacare for elimination, including premium subsidies, taxes and mandates on individuals and businesses.\n\nRyan told reporters Tuesday that he and other Republicans have already put forward a replacement plan that potentially could start to come together around the time of final action on the repeal of Obamacare. “It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,” he said. “We’re going to use every tool at our disposal … so that we can save people from this mess.”\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nHowever, five GOP senators – Corker, Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – offered an amendment on Monday that would extend the target date for House and Senate committees to complete work on the final wording of the resolution to March 3, according to media reports.\n\nCorker said that since Trump stated shortly after the election that repeal and replacement of Obamacare should take place simultaneously, the amendment would provide the incoming administration with more time to outline its priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul, the Kentucky libertarian who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, has thrust himself into the debate by calling for a delay in repealing the law until Trump and the Republicans can cobble together a replacement plan acceptable to a majority of Republicans.\n\nPaul said that he and Trump were in contact last Friday and that Trump is open to considering a replacement plan that Paul is working on. Trump, Ryan, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, and other Republicans have floated various proposals for a new, more market-based approach to health care coverage, but none of them has gained traction yet.\n\nRelated: Here's the GOP's 2017 New Year’s Resolution: Avoid Self-Inflicted Wounds\n\nCorker – possibly tongue in cheek – asked Trump to tweet out confirmation that he and Paul were working together on an alternative approach. “If it is his view, it would be really good if he would consider tweeting it out very clearly,” Corker told reporters. “There’s more and more concerns about not doing it simultaneously.”\n\nIn the House, meanwhile, members of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus met Monday night to confer on possibly seeking a delay in acting on the budget resolution. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the new chair of the caucus, told Bloomberg that his group wants to see more details about a replacement plan before voting on the budget resolution.\n\nMeadows and about a dozen other caucus members conferred with Rand Paul last week, who argued that the budget resolution not only could cause chaos in the health care system but also add substantially to the debt. \"We hope they would see the prudence of waiting,\" Meadows said of the GOP leadership."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/10/Federal-Spending-Wastebook-Outrageous-More-Ways-One",
    "text": "Retired Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn was always going to be a tough act to follow when it came to producing the colorful “Wastebook” that he and his staff put out every year to document what they saw as profligate government spending. But Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who inherited the Wastebook when Coburn retired after the 2014 edition, is certainly trying hard. Maybe too hard.\n\nThis year’s edition, released Tuesday, is titled “Porkemon Go” and features a cartoon version of Flake on the front, dressed as the character Ash Ketchum from the Pokemon series. It follows on last year’s version, “Wastebook 2015: The Farce Awakens” which took the film from the Star Wars franchise as its theme.\n\nRelated: Here's the GOP's 2017 New Year’s Resolution: Avoid Self-Inflicted Wounds\n\nThe collection of supposed outrages has always been presented as an affront to fiscal responsibility, and this year’s version is no different. “Within mere days, the national debt will top $20 trillion, the largest amount ever owed by any nation in history, and the federal government’s authority to borrow expires in March,” Flake writes in the introduction. “But rather than making a long overdue resolution to be fiscally responsible, the promises from Washington are to spend even more.”\n\nHe continues, “As an example, this past year the outgoing Administration requested that Congress provide billions of dollars in additional money to pay for efforts to address the spread of Zika, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that can cause birth defects. At the same time, the nation’s most prestigious science agencies were squandering resources already available by investigating matters most would consider obvious or even absurd.”\n\nThe Wastebook is a complicated subject to write about objectively. Heavy on snark and mockery, it identifies dozens of examples of obscure federal spending, many of which are objectively wasteful or corrupt. But it also has a history of ridiculing scientific research grants by describing them in narrowest possible way, often omitting their connection to a larger field of legitimate research. Grantees have also criticized it for vastly inflating the amount of money spent on specific studies, or using misleading descriptions of programs to generate anger at the government.\n\nThis year’s version looks as though part of it could be subjected to similar criticism. For example, one supposed outrage is that a handful of liquor stores have taken advantage of a Department of Agriculture program to support rural businesses’ effort to install energy efficient lighting.\n\nRelated: 15 States Americans Are Ditching: What’s the Matter With Wyoming?\n\nThe section, titled “Getting Lit at the Liquor Store,” complains that the $5,000 grant to a store called Newberry Liquors, in Newberry, Florida, went to an establishment that, “In addition to liquor, wine, and beer ... also serves cigarettes and tobacco products.”\n\nThe section flags several other liquor stores that also benefited from the program, creating the impression that the program is specifically aimed at them. The truth, though, is that thousands of rural businesses benefit from the Rural Energy for America Program, from family farms to supermarkets. The Wastebook barely acknowledges that fact at the end of the section, with the throwaway line, “Taxpayers should not have to subsidize the lighting or electricity costs of liquor stores or other businesses” -- where “other businesses” represents the overwhelming majority of the program’s beneficiaries.\n\nA quick read of the report would also suggest that the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry was given a $150,000 federal grant to develop “earthquake-proof gingerbread houses.”\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk ‘Expanding the Swamp’ by Ramming Through Cabinet Picks\n\nOnce past the headline, the write-up of the study at least acknowledges that the holiday-themed gingerbread program was aimed at engaging mostly younger visitors with the principles of engineering in an accessible manner. But what the book doesn’t do is point out that the $150,000 grant was provided to fund a series of three different exhibits, of which the gingerbread-themed program appears to have been just one.\n\nOn page 137 of the Wastebook, after 50 examples of supposed government profligacy comes the disclaimer, “The best effort was made to determine the precise cost of the activity, product or service profiled in an entry paid for with taxpayer funds. However, in some cases the exact amount spent was not tracked by the agency, could not be determined, or was spent over a number of years, including future years. Therefore, the amount provided may be the total amount budgeted for the program or grant profiled rather than for the specific purpose highlighted.”\n\nNone of this is to say that the Wastebook doesn’t identify some pretty iffy government projects.\n\nFor example, Flake’s researchers identified a “spaceport” in Alaska that continues to receive government funding from the Department of Defense despite the fact that it hasn’t been used in years, and appears to be in a serious state of disrepair.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Is Coming to the Rescue with an Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nAnother is a Florida municipal planning authority that has apparently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on dubious projects that include golf tournaments and dragon boat races.\n\nAnd there is no shortage of scientific studies that -- at least presented the way they are by Flake’s writers -- seem pretty absurd. There are fish on treadmills, lustful monkeys and surfing cats. But in many cases, the authors of the book don’t really give the recipients of the grants the opportunity to explain themselves.\n\nThat might have been a better use of their time than composing really dreadful paragraphs like this one, complaining about funding for a fishing museum in Massachusetts:\n\n“By reeling in $32,000 from two different agencies, the fledgling Fishing Heritage Center proves that catching government grants is like shooting fish in a barrel. Both grants are supporting efforts to bait tourists to the area by telling fish tales.”"

    "text": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) may have just derailed congressional GOP leaders’ efforts to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act without a clear replacement plan in hand. He did it by apparently enlisting the support of President-elect Donald Trump in concocting an alternative health insurance program that could garner widespread support within their party.\n\nPaul and a small handful of other Senate Republicans have raised concerns about GOP leaders forging ahead with a budget “reconciliation” bill that would repeal key provisions of Obamacare -- including premium subsidies and new taxes to finance the program– without immediately addressing the impact on more than 20 million Americans enrolled in plans and insurers likely incur huge losses.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\n“We should repeal Obamacare, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and may eventually lead to calls for a taxpayer bailout of insurance companies,” he wrote recently.\n\nNow Paul, 53, a libertarian who ran an unsuccessful campaign for president last year, is attempting to thrust himself in the middle of the GOP debate over how best to keep a solemn campaign pledge to obliterate Obamacare within weeks of Trump taking power -- but without triggering an angry backlash from millions of people who likely would lose their coverage.\n\nPaul says he is working on a replacement plan of his own. It is one made up of some of the best ideas floated by Republicans in recent years, and he hopes to have it ready for Trump’s consideration early this week.\n\nHe told Politico Monday that Trump called him last Friday night after seeing an interview in which Paul said that Congress should vote on an Obama replacement at the same time it repeals the law.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\n“He said he was in complete agreement with that,” Paul told Politico, after tweeting out the news last week.\n\nI just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017\n\nTrump told CBS’s “60 Minutes” shortly after the Nov. 8 election that he would like to see repeal and replacement of Obamacare handled simultaneously, although he subsequently backed away from any specific timetable.\n\nYesterday, Trump told reporters in New York that he’s “not even a little bit worried” about how Republicans will replace Obamacare, and that in the end everything will work out. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said over the weekend that Congress would follow up Obamacare repeal legislation with a replacement program “very quickly,” but without setting a timetable. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said last week that he was confident a replacement plan could be approved by the end of this year.\n\nBut this is no simple task. Getting all the stakeholders—hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, governors of states that expanded Medicaid—to agree on a framework is like holding a tenant’s meeting in a New York City apartment building.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nSenior Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chair of the Health, Education and Labor Committee, has warned that it could take as long as two years before Congress finally sorts out a replacement for the Affordable Care Act that could garner some needed Democratic support.\n\nPaul says he’s not trying to be the fly in the ointment but a catalyst for speeding up the process by pressing for simultaneous consideration of repeal and replacement legislation. Senate and House GOP Leaders are determined to stage votes this week and next on the preliminary budget action required to authorize committees in both chambers to draft the specific language for repealing Obamacare subsidies, taxes and mandates. That process could take weeks or months before a final plan is stitched together and approved by the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats and other critics say it’s reckless of Trump and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill to rush to repeal the 2010 law before they can agree on a comprehensive replacement plan that preserves coverage for millions of Americans who signed up for Obamacare and prevents the insurance markets, health care providers and the pharmaceutical industry from falling into a financial death spiral.\n\nPaul is not alone in his effort to forestall a vote on repealing Obamacare until a consensus emerges on replacement legislation. Others including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have also voiced support for a coordinated approach. And with a relatively modest 52 to 48 seat majority, McConnell can’t afford more than two to three defections to achieve his goals.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nPaul didn't offer any details yesterday concerning what he would include in his healthcare bill. He wrote in an op-ed recently that Obamacare should be replaced with \"freedom\" to choose inexpensive insurance free of government dictates. He also said he favors allowing unlimited savings in health savings accounts and authority for major insurers to sell policies across state lines – proposals that Trump has also endorsed.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell delivered a farewell address on Monday warning of a looming chaotic situation in which tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage.\n\n“I think we haven’t seen a real [Republican] proposal for replacement,” she said in responding to a question about whether any of the GOP proposals being floated might be acceptable to the Democrats. “We have not seen a plan that can be measured or scored” or that adequately addresses the need for broad coverage and access, affordable premiums and quality of health care.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nLast night, Senate Democrats planned to deliver floor speeches and Facebook Live broadcasts denouncing the Republicans’ efforts to unravel Obamacare and push for cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Planned Parenthood, according to Huffington Post. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and his members also are preparing to slow Senate action on a budget “reconciliation” package to repeal key elements of Obamacare by offering scores of “poison pill” amendments late this week in a “Vote-a-Rama” that could last a day or more.\n\n“If the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement, the damage to the country’s individual insurance market will begin this spring,” Burwell said in her speech. “If health insurance companies don’t know what the market will look like going forward, many will either raise prices or drop out. That means more Americans won’t be able to afford coverage, and others won’t be able to find it at all.”\n\nWhile estimates vary on the potential adverse effect of a repeal of Obamacare, a recent Urban Institute study concluded that as many as 30 million Americans could lose their coverage. The share of non-elderly people lacking insurance coverage would increase from 11 percent to 21 percent – a higher rate of uninsured than before the advent of Obamacare.\n\n“If Congress never enacts a comprehensive replacement, the consequences for American health care would be stark. We would not just go backwards – we would fall far behind where we started.”"

    "text": "As Donald Trump’s designated National Security Adviser, former three-star Army General Mike Flynn will be in one of the most sensitive and influential posts within the new Administration. But his job title is not Cabinet-level and confirmation by the Senate is not required.\n\nStill, that hasn’t stopped Democrats from attacking the president-elect’s choice and even suggesting that Flynn should step aside, saying he “doesn't have the judgment for the job.\"\n\nRelated: Out Like Flynn: Why Trump Must Dump the ‘Fake News’ General\n\nLast Thursday, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Hillary Clinton’s running mate, told CNN, \"Gen. Flynn's trafficking in conspiracy stories that a fourth grader would find incredible suggests either that he's highly gullible or that he's so consumed with malice that he loses his ability to judge what's fact and what's fiction.”\n\nKaine was referring to the dissemination by Flynn and his son Michael, then the general’s chief of staff, of fake news stories during the election – especially disturbing tweets (#PizzaGate) that linked Clinton and campaign chief John Podesta to a supposed ring of child-sex traffickers run out of the basement of a popular pizza restaurant in Washington.\n\nAs reported in a Fiscal Times column early last month calling for Flynn to step aside, scurrilous social media posts about Comet Ping Pong led an armed avenger from North Carolina to invade the restaurant on Dec. 4, assault weapon in hand, to free the young sex slaves. No captives were found. The “white knight” was arrested. And the Comet’s owner pointed out that the restaurant doesn’t even have a basement.\n\nMichael Flynn -- whom Mike Pence said was never part of the transition team until he was contradicted by a transition team spokesperson -- was summarily dispatched, but the General remains by the President-elect’s side.\n\nOn Monday, 53 nonprofits signed a letter calling Flynn “unfit for serving in this critical post” because of his “deeply troubling history of bigoted and deceitful statements and his alarming ties to foreign governments….”\n\nOther than J Street, the liberal Jewish organization, and MoveOn.org, a progressive organizing group, you probably never heard of most of the organizations, many of which are religious and/or peaceniks.\n\nBut given U.S. intelligence revelations about Russia’s attempts to disrupt the American presidential election process, discredit Clinton and elect Trump through hacking, fake news, and state-controlled media, they have a point about Flynn’s “alarming ties.”\n\nRelated: Is Trump’s Team Headed for an Epic Clash Over Classified Intelligence?\n\nThe declassified report on Russian hacking released on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and presented to Trump said in part, “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”\n\n“RT” refers to Russia Today, the 24-hour, English-language TV news channel funded by the Russian government. In December 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow for RT’s 10th anniversary, collected a speaker’s fee that he has declined to disclose, and attended a gala dinner at which he was seated at the right hand of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the U.S. intelligence report says “ordered the influence campaign” aimed at the U.S. election.\n\nIn addition, as Yahoo News investigative reporter Mike Isikoff revealed in November, Flynn “began receiving classified national security briefings last summer while he was also running a private consulting firm that offered ‘all-source intelligence support’ to international clients.”\n\nBeyond that, the Flynn Intel Group, which the general launched after he was first appointed and then ousted as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Obama, registered to lobby for a wealthy associate of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey while Flynn was advising candidate Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump Being Advised by Ex-U.S. Lieutenant General Who Favors Closer Russia Ties\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed on Sunday, William J. Burns, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former ambassador to Russia under President George W. Bush, wrote, “The reality is that our relationship with Russia will remain competitive, and often adversarial, for the foreseeable future. At its core is a fundamental disconnect in outlook and about each other’s role in the world. It is tempting to think that personal rapport can bridge this disconnect and that the art of the deal can unlock a grand bargain. That is a foolish starting point for sensible policy. It would be especially foolish to think that Russia’s deeply troubling interference in our election can or should be played down, however inconvenient.”\n\nThus far, Flynn has been mum about Russian interference in the election, though his boss’s skepticism until a day or two ago may be a reflection of the general’s influence.\n\nGiven the fake news, the ties to RT and Putin and possible conflicts of interest not fully explored but troubling on their face, can Flynn be trusted to be a credible counselor to the incoming president on issues affecting the sanctity and safety of the republic?\n\nJust as important, can a critical adviser already compromised be trusted by other members of the intelligence community?\n\nThe answers are simple: no and no. And that is why Flynn must go."

    "text": "Just a couple of weeks before the end of the Obama administration, the Justice Department has begun to come around on the importance of holding individual executives accountable for corporate crimes. But the current prosecution of the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal brings into focus how easy it would have been to proceed this way for the last eight years, especially in the cases of financial institutions involved in the 2008 crisis and its aftermath.\n\nOver the weekend, the FBI arrested Oliver Schmidt, who led the key U.S. regulatory compliance office at Volkswagen, for conspiracy to commit fraud. According to the indictment, Schmidt repeatedly lied to regulators, denying that Volkswagen used special software to cheat emissions tests for its diesel vehicles, when he knew that was company strategy. These “defeat devices” allowed VW cars on American roads that emitted up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide (NOx). If convicted, Schmidt would face five years in prison.\n\nRelated: US Approves First Fix for 70,000 Polluting VW Diesel Vehicles\n\nThe indictment accompanies an expected settlement of a criminal investigation against Volkswagen, in which the company will actually have to plead guilty to criminal misconduct and pay billions in fines. That’s on top of $16 billion in class-action civil settlements involving half a million cars, where customers can either sell their vehicles back to Volkswagen or have them fixed to reduce NOx emissions.\n\nJust forcing a guilty plea on a car company is an upgrade on previous settlements with General Motors and Toyota. But the VW scandal broke just as the Justice Department promised in an internal memo to prioritize individual prosecutions of corporate criminals, after facing criticism for failing to do so after the financial crisis. The so-called Yates memo, named after Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, said that companies must turn over officials responsible for corporate crime, including senior management. The VW case offered a key test of whether the Yates memo would be adhered to when the target was a giant global conglomerate.\n\nProsecutors obeyed the Yates memo by following the chain of command. In September, Robert Liang, who worked in the company’s engine development department, pled guilty to conspiracy charges, agreeing to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence. In the Schmidt complaint, the FBI revealed that it has two other unnamed cooperating witnesses from Volkswagen, who are also working with investigators on the case.\n\nRelated: Silicon Valley’s Self-Serving Vision for Self-Driving Cars\n\nAny law enforcement professional would call this “police work 101.” The FBI identified lower-level employees involved in circumventing U.S. emissions tests, flipped them to work with the investigation and moved on to find those responsible for authorizing and directing both the scandal and the response.\n\nSchmidt is the first such higher-ranking official charged, but probably not the last. According to the complaint, Schmidt and his colleagues learned in March 2014 about a West Virginia University study that found that VW cars would perform differently on the road than in emissions tests. That was over a year before the VW executives finally disclosed the defeat devices to regulators. Schmidt wrote specifically in a chart that failure to explain what researchers discovered about increased emissions would lead to “indictment.”\n\nIn July 2015, Schmidt attended a meeting at VW headquarters, where the subject of handling regulator questions was broached. “Rather than advocate for disclosure of the defeat device to regulators, VW executive management authorized its continued concealment,” the complaint reads. Right after that meeting, Schmidt followed orders and lied to the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board about the emissions discrepancies.\n\nRelated: VW, Justice Dept. Nearing $3 Billion Deal to Resolve Diesel Allegations\n\nAt another meeting in Germany in August 2015, Schmidt huddled with “other co-conspirators” to plot how to handle an upcoming meeting with regulators. Senior VW managers approved a plan for “continuing to conceal the defeat device.” But one of the FBI’s cooperating witnesses blew the whistle a week later, disclosing the defeat devices at the meeting “in direct contravention of instructions from his management.”\n\nThe narrative in the complaint directly implicates senior management at Volkswagen in covering up the defeat devices. It’s almost certain that more executives will face criminal charges as a result. That could lead all the way to Volkswagen’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn.\n\nSo after a methodical investigation, prosecutors secured cooperation from knowledgeable insiders, amassed evidence and found top executives responsible for criminal actions. The prosecutorial playbook works, in other words, and claims of difficulties in finding explicit culpability among executives do not hold water, given the VW case.\n\nThere is no reason that the same process could not have been used for Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and many other institutions that played a role in the financial crisis. We had the names of the traders who marketed and sold dodgy mortgage securities to investors without disclosing the risks. We had millions of false documents issued to courtrooms and county offices nationwide, with forged signatures attached to them. That’s a wealth of raw material from which to begin an effort to locate who authorized the fraudulent materials, and who directed those people to authorize them, and so on, until law enforcement reached every C-suite at every major financial institution in America.\n\nRelated: Another Wells Fargo Scandal Proves Our Financial System Is Still Broken\n\nWaiting nearly eight years to put this detective work into practice begs the question of why it laid dormant for so long. Moreover the buzzer-beating conduct in the Volkswagen case could go for naught. Within weeks, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions will likely take over running the Justice Department. There’s no guarantee he will follow through with Volkswagen executive criminal indictments; in fact, senators on the Judiciary Committee should ask him that question at his confirmation hearings, which begin today.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Sessions did say in 2010 that DoJ shouldn’t hesitate to charge companies that break the law, and Volkswagen actually wants to close its settlement with the current administration rather than facing the unknown with the new attorney general. But off-the-cuff statements in the Senate and actual responsibility at Justice are two different things. We simply don’t know how Sessions will act and whether the Yates memo will have any meaning.\n\nOf course, prosecutors shouldn’t need a memo to know the importance of seeking accountability for all crimes, regardless of wealth and power. Seeing this principle enforced in the case of Volkswagen would give Americans renewed confidence in the justice system. But it would also remind them that it took President Obama’s Justice Department nearly two entire terms to restore that principle. It’s hard not to view that as too little and too late."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/09/Trump-Barking-Wrong-Tree-When-It-Comes-Saving-American-Jobs",
    "text": "A bit like a rooster taking credit for the sunrise, Donald Trump is now claiming responsibility every time a company decides to open or expand a facility in the U.S. The credit-taking is sometimes divorced from whether or not his impending presidency had any causal relationship with the decision.\n\nThe latest example is the decision by Fiat Chrysler to upgrade two plants in the Midwest and add 2,000 new jobs. Trump and his advisers leapt on the news immediately on Monday morning, suggesting that it was the prospect of a Trump administration that led the automaker to invest more in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nThey did this, even as they linked to news reports in which auto executives said that manufacturing expansions on this scale are decided on years in advance and that Fiat Chrysler is actually just executing a plan announced long before anyone seriously believed Trump could be elected president.\n\nBut whether or not Trump actually deserves credit for the creation or “reshoring” of these jobs is less important to experts on labor economics than the type of jobs he is focused on.\n\nTrump was elected, in part, by the votes of men and women in states across the Rust Belt, where the brutal decline of heavy manufacturing between 1980 and 2000 left millions out of work.\n\nDay after day in rallies in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, he promised that he would bring back the glory days, when manufacturing jobs were plentiful and promised a solid middle-class lifestyle.\n\nThe problem is that those days just aren’t coming back. The U.S. lost 6.7 million manufacturing jobs between 1980 and 2014. If Trump convinced one company a week to create 2,000 new manufacturing jobs in the US, it would take 64 years to replace them.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here’s How Much It’ll Cost\n\n“[N]o one should be under the illusion that millions of manufacturing jobs are coming back to America,” Mark Muro writes in the MIT Technology Review.\n\nMuro, a senior fellow and the director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, points out that contrary to Trump’s claim, relentlessly repeated on the stump, that “We don’t make anything anymore,” the U.S. manufacturing sector is actually extraordinarily strong.\n\n“In fact, the total inflation-adjusted output of the U.S. manufacturing sector is now higher than it has ever been,” he writes. “That’s true even as the sector’s employment is growing only slowly, and remains near the lowest it’s been. These diverging lines—which reflect improved productivity—highlight a huge problem with Trump’s promises to help workers by reshoring millions of manufacturing jobs. America is already producing a lot. And in any event, the return of more manufacturing won’t bring back many jobs, because the labor is increasingly being done by robots.”\n\nChart: MIT Technology Review\n\nIf Trump really wants to help displaced factory workers, Muro says, he’d do better to focus on education, job training and retraining, and cash assistance to those displaced, rather than trying to reassemble a 1960s era manufacturing economy.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons So Many Americans Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck\n\nAs it stands, Trump’s outsized attachment to the style of U.S. manufacturing he may remember from his childhood comes at the cost of attention to other U.S. workers who are being displaced from different jobs. Trump’s intervention to defer the planned closing of an air conditioner factory last year drove weeks’ worth of headlines and won Trump praise when Carrier Corp. agreed to keep about 800 workers in Indiana, for the time being, at least.\n\nContrast that with the attention Trump has paid to the announcement last week that the retail clothing chain The Limited was closing its 250 stores. That means the loss of some 800 full-time jobs and more than 3,000 additional part-time jobs.\n\nThe closing mirrors a broader trend in the retail industry. Trump’s one-time partner, Macy’s, announced the closure of dozens of stores this month as well. And while Trump at least didn’t cheer the company’s latest stumble, he also didn’t lament it. It’s not exactly clear why, especially given that the retail trade sector employs more Americans right now than the manufacturing sector has in well over a decade.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Job No. 1: Recoup the Jobs, Wages and Security Lost to Trade Deals\n\nThe same sort of technology-led innovation that has hammered the manufacturing sector is hitting the retail sector now, except that retail clerks are being replaced by web browsers instead of robots. And guess who’s doing all the jobs in the fulfillment centers that drive online retailing? Yep. Increasingly, it’s robots. Angel Gonzalez of the Seattle Times reported in January on the continued growth of what he called Amazon’s “robot army.”\n\nThe world’s largest e-commerce retailer said it has 45,000 robots in some 20 fulfillment centers. That’s a bigger headcount than that of the armed forces of the Netherlands, a NATO member, according to World Bank data. It’s also a cool 50 percent increase from last year’s holiday season, when the company had some 30,000 robots working alongside 230,000 humans.\n\nWhile it won’t make him look as though he’s riding to the rescue, at least in the next news cycle, if Trump really wants to help American workers, he might focus less on a backward-looking return to a “greatness” he remembers from decades ago. Instead, he should be asking the smartest people he can find -- economists, technologists, innovators and entrepreneurs -- what the country will need to be great in a world where the direct input of human labor into the economy looks much different than it did in the past."

    "text": "After congressional ethics experts, voters, and President-elect Donald Trump forced House Republicans to back down last week from a rules change that would have eviscerated the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, one important sentence quietly slipped through another rule change.\n\nThat sentence enables individual members to hide official documents that could prove embarrassing or even incriminating if they were suddenly investigated by the ethics office or the Justice Department for criminal activity.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk ‘Expanding the Swamp’ by Ramming Through Cabinet Picks\n\nThe new rule states that records created, generated or received by the congressional office of a House member “are exclusively the personal property of the individual member” and that the member “has control over such records,” according to a report by OpenSecrets.org.\n\nWhile the rule change might seem relatively benign on the surface, it has severe and troubling implications for future ethical oversight and investigations of members of Congress as the Republicans fully take charge of Congress and the White House.\n\nSheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said Monday that the rules change “is not good” and threatens to erode ethical oversight in government further. She said it leads to a situation where “There’s no cop on the beat – that we’ve lost a critical element of independent oversight” over government records and members’ activities.\n\n“Why on earth would Congress now create barriers to investigation and subpoenas of a member’s spending records?” she added. “This only benefits the incumbent politicians who passed this rule and those who would flout it, not the system and certainly not the public.\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump’s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nCongressional Republicans have long complained of what they consider an overly aggressive ethics office and probes that deny them due process. Had the new rule been in effect before, federal prosecutors likely would have had a much harder time making a case against former Illinois Republican House member Aaron Schock, a one-time rising star who was forced to resign in the wake of revelations of lavish government spending. That spending included a $40,000 “Downton Abbey”-style redecoration of his Capitol Hill office, complete with a $5,000 chandelier.\n\nSchock was charged with wire fraud, making false statements and filing false federal income tax returns in a 52-page indictment filed last November. But before the indictment, Schock’s lawyers and the Justice Department argued over who held control of his financial documents, which included records of expenditures for redecorating and other purchases. Schock’s lawyers argued and lost the argument that the former House member was protected from having to produce the records – and potentially incriminating himself -- under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nRelated: GOP House, Off to a Shaky Start, Backtracks on Killing Ethics Panel\n\nFor sure, there will be a need for heightened vigilance of Congress and the incoming Trump administration in the coming years, as congressional Republicans continue to try to soften ethical oversight rules and Trump and his wealthy cabinet members seek to navigate past media and public watchdog concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nChaka Fattah (D-PA) was convicted on 23 counts of racketeering, fraud and other corruption charges last year. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison on December 12.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has been under a review by the Office of Congressional Ethics for the past year for allegations that he siphoned off tens of thousands of dollars of campaign fund for personal use, including his children’s private school tuition and lunches, trips to Disney Land and SeaWorld, jewelry and sporting goods. The San Diego Union-Tribune, which has been aggressively covering the case, reported last week that Hunter used campaign funds to pay for $600 of airline fees to fly a pet rabbit.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the new House rule will greatly complicate any thorough examination of Hunter’s campaign and congressional office spending practices."

    "text": "It was fitting that the most consequential week of the transition period between Donald Trump’s election and his inauguration as president kicked off early Monday morning with the president-elect attacking the most revered actor of her generation as “overrated” because she criticized him during brief remarks at an awards show.\n\nThis is how it’s going to be for the next four years: Matters of extraordinary gravity will contest with matters of abject triviality for the attention of the country.\n\nRelated: Team Trump Continues to Misrepresent Intel Findings on Russia Hacks\n\nConsider what’s on the table for the next few days.\n\nThe week ahead will feature confirmation hearings for as many as seven of Trump’s nominees to major cabinet positions, even though, as the head of the Office of Government Ethics reported over the weekend, the necessary ethics and background checks for several of them will be incomplete at the time of the hearings.\n\nAlso scheduled for this week is Trump’s long-awaited announcement about how he plans to deal with the voluminous conflicts of interests inherent in his being at once the President of the United States and the owner of a for-profit company with business interests around the globe. He also says that he will take questions from the press in his first real press conference since July of last year.\n\nThis will all happen as the Senate marches ahead with a budget resolution designed to lay the groundwork for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, something many in the Republican-controlled Congress appear poised to support despite the absence of a substantive plan to replace Obamacare, a move that experts fear could throw the nation’s health care system into chaos and leave 20 million people without health insurance.\n\nRelated: Republicans Risk ‘Expanding the Swamp’ by Ramming Through Cabinet Picks\n\nThere will be a few other things scattered throughout the week, as well. On Monday morning, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will give a speech warning of the dangers of wholesale repeal of the ACA. On Tuesday, President Obama will deliver his “farewell” speech from Chicago. And on Thursday, in a town hall event hosted by CNN, House Speaker Paul Ryan will likely outline his vision for a massive overhaul of federal entitlement programs, the tax code, and the federal budget at a time when his party controls both the legislative and executive branches of the government.\n\nSo, on that note, back to Trump bashing Meryl Streep.\n\nThe short version is this: Streep got an award at the Golden Globes last night, and used the platform to criticize Trump for his habit of attacking and denigrating people he sees as his opponents, focusing mainly on his mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter. She also called for protections for the media.\n\nTrump responded by attacking and denigrating Streep. Calling her “one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood” and a “Hillary flunky who lost big.” He also repeated his angry denial that he had mocked the reporter, something that the video of the moment appears to confirm. Trump even took a midnight phone call from a New York Times Culture section reporter so that he could denounce Streep’s criticism.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nThere is a popular undercurrent in social media-enabled criticism of the mainstream press that Trump and his team are deviously clever when it comes to misdirection -- offering up shiny objects to send the press pack scurrying off for comment on his latest Twitter outbursts at a time when they ought to be digging into more serious issues.\n\nThis appears to credit Donald Trump with more foresight than he really deserves. The reaction to Streep was not part of some grand plan. It was purely reflexive. Trump feels slighted, Trump lashes out. That’s how he operates.\n\nThe frequent call to simply ignore Trump’s Twitter outbursts is unreasonable and dangerous, given that the mainstream media no longer has the “gatekeeper” function it used to. The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker put it plainly in a series of tweets of his own on Sunday.\n\nTrump's tweets can no longer be dismissed as there he goes again. Now he moves markets, stokes anxiety, alters plans https://t.co/Zgw16iyBTc — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) January 8, 2017\n\nRelated: Trump’s Job No. 1: Recoup the Jobs, Wages and Security Lost to Trade Deals\n\nLots of debate on my mentions on covering or ignoring Trump tweets. This is how PEOTUS chooses to communicate to public. It's news. Period. — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) January 8, 2017\n\nThe issue here isn’t the idea that the media shouldn’t be covering Trump’s intemperate Twitter outbursts at all because it distracts from the real issues. The mainstream press is quite capable of covering more than one story at a time; and besides, trending topics on Facebook and Twitter these days do as much to determine what the “big story” of the day is as the front page of The New York Times.\n\nThe actual question now is how they should be covered.\n\nMaybe this article can serve as an imperfect example of how it can be done. If members of the media cannot ignore Trump’s tweets and Facebook rants, we can, at least, contextualize them. We can, while reporting that the leader of the most powerful military on the planet had his feelings hurt by an actor or comedian, point out the things he’s NOT paying attention to while he vents his rage in 140-character bursts."

    "text": "The concept of transparency in government and politics has taken a real beating this past year.\n\nGOP President-elect Donald Trump won the election but refused to release his income tax returns. That made it impossible for voters to gauge his truthfulness in boasting of his charitable contributions or look at his investments in Russia and other countries.\n\n\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump’s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nLate last week, a top government ethics official, Walter M Shaub Jr., warned that Senate GOP leadership plans to confirm Trump’s top cabinet choices before all of their background checks are concluded – an extraordinary breach of the chamber’s constitutional “advise and consent” responsibilities.\n\nIn the Republicans’ haste to confirm seven of Trump’s most important cabinet selections, including Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama as Attorney General and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, Senate hearings will be held before the nominees have fully responded to requests for detailed information on their finances and personal and professional backgrounds, according to media reports.\n\nTrump has assembled one of the wealthiest cabinets in history -- millionaires and billionaires with complex financial portfolios and decades of business dealings and potential conflicts of interest with the major federal departments and agencies they might soon lead.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, a billionaire former Goldman Sachs partner, tapped to be secretary of the Treasure, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross who was nominated to be Commerce Secretary, and wealthy GOP political operative Betsy DeVos, who was picked to head the Department of Education, all have mind-boggling financial histories and dealings that need to be thoroughly vetted.\n\nRelated: Trump Gets a Taste of What’s to Come If He Refuses to Exit His Businesses\n\nShaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, informed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by letter Friday that the announced hearing schedule beginning Tuesday had stretched ethics investigators to the breaking point and that several of the nominees have not yet completed the vetting process.\n\n“More significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings,” Shaub said, according to The Washington Post. Shaub added that he is unaware of any occasion in the 40 years since the ethics office was established when the Senate held confirmation hearings before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\n\nSchumer complained over the weekend that Trump’s transition team had conspired with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other GOP leaders to “jam through” the nominations. What’s more, Schumer and other Democrats have urged the House Ethics Committee to begin investigating the stock holdings and investment strategy of Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), a leading proponent of dismantling Obamacare who has been nominated by Trump to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late last month that Price traded more than $300,000 in shares of health-related companies during the past four years while he sponsored legislation – including a replacement for Obamacare and a measure to privatize Medicare – that potentially could impact those companies’ stocks. Federal law prohibits members of Congress from trading on information they obtained in the course of their official work that was not available to the public, although the House ethics committee typically has trouble proving violations.\n\nRelated: House Republicans Weaken Ethics Body as They Return to Congress\n\nBy now, Trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington of big-money special interest influence and unsavory political practices has become laughable. Trump is scheduled to hold his first press conference in almost two months on Wednesday, and he is certain to be asked to spell out how he and his cabinet choices will avert flagrant conflicts of interest in assuming the reins of government and regulatory activity.\n\nSome GOP aides disputed Shaub’s claim that no nominees in prior Republican and Democratic administrations were confirmed by the Senate before they submitted all the necessary paperwork and had been thoroughly vetted.\n\nRepublican National Committee chair Reince Priebus, Trump’s choice as the next White House chief of staff, on Sunday dismissed concerns about senators having to pass judgment on nominees without complete background information. Instead of complaining about the narrow timetable for action, Shaub and the Democrats need to hurry up and meet the deadline set by the Republicans, Priebus said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nRelated: GOP House, Off to a Shaky Start, Backtracks on Killing Ethics Panel\n\n“They have to get moving, they have to move faster,” Priebus said. “They have all the information. These [nominees] are people who have been highly successful in their lives. They [the vetters] need to move quicker.”\n\nPriebus added that voters are demanding swift action by the Senate. “Change was voted for and change we will get,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, McConnell said that it was time for the Democrats to “grow up” and get past their loss in the Nov. 8 election. \"All of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration in having not only lost the White House but having lost the Senate,\" McConnell said on CBS’s Face the Nation.\n\n\"I understand that,\" he added, \"but we need to sort of grow up here and get past that.\""

    "text": "Our survey includes 116 U.S. cities with populations greater than 200,000, based primarily on date from 2015 financial reports issued by the cities themselves. Of the cities we analyzed, three had not published 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports by the end of 2016. Two of these cities are in New Jersey (Newark and Jersey City), where local governments do not publish audited financial statements following U.S. Governmental Accounting Standards. The state has its own system for local government financial reporting.\n\nThe third city, Baltimore, will publish its 2015 CAFR in early 2017, which is quite late. Federal regulations require state and local governments that receive over $750,000 in federal funds to file audited financial statements no later than nine months after their fiscal year end. Since Baltimore’s fiscal year ends on June 30, it should have filed its 2015 CAFR no later than March 31, 2016. For all three of the cities that did not publish 2015 CAFRs, we estimated scoring inputs based on other financial disclosures.\n\nRelated: See the Full 2017 Fiscal Strength Index Ranking of 116 US Cities\n\nOur scoring system, based on a 100-point scale, is described in this new working paper on alternatives to municipal bond ratings. It uses five factors:\n\n1. the ratio of a city’s general fund balance to its expenditures (40 percent weighting)\n\n2. the ratio of its long term obligations (including OPEB but excluding pensions) to total government-wide revenues (30 percent weighting)\n\n3. the ratio of actuarially determined pension contributions to total government-wide revenues (10 percent weighting)\n\n4. change in local unemployment rate in 2015 (10 percent weighting)\n\n5. change in property values in 2015 (10 percent weighting).\n\nRelated: Chicago, New York in Worst Financial Shape Among Large US Cities\n\nThe first three measures were obtained from Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, while the last two are derived from other sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis for unemployment rates and Zillow for home values. These two measures were included to gauge the future direction of city revenues: Weakening employment and home values could presage a decline in revenue, making a given city vulnerable to fiscal turmoil.\n\nTo get a perfect score of 100, a city would have to have a general fund balance of at least 32 percent of general fund expenditures; long-term obligations (excluding pensions) no greater than 40 percent of total revenue; actuarially required pension contributions equal to no more than 5 percent of total revenue; stable or declining unemployment; and home price appreciation of at least 3 percent.\n\nIt is not necessary for a city to have a near­-perfect score to be regarded as a good fiscal steward. Any score higher than 70 could reasonably be interpreted as a level of fiscal health sufficient to justify a AA­A credit rating, the highest possible.\n\nTo see the data behind the scores, please visit the new Center for Municipal Finance website."

    "text": "Chicago and New York rank at the bottom of a new analysis of fiscal strength based primarily on data from 2015 financial reports issued by the cities themselves. The analysis includes 116 U.S. cities with populations greater than 200,000. See the full rankings here.\n\nChicago’s position at the bottom of the ranking is no surprise to anyone who follows municipal finance. The Windy City has become a poster child for financial mismanagement, having suffered a series of ratings downgrades in recent years. Aside from having thin reserves and large volumes of outstanding debt, Chicago is notorious for its underfunded pension plans.\n\nFor example, the city’s Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund (MEABF) reported $4.7 billion in assets and $14.7 billion of actuarially accrued liabilities at the end of 2015, representing a funded ratio of just 33 percent. The actuarial calculations rely on a controversial practice of discounting future benefits at a rate of 7.5 percent, which is the assumed return on the fund’s portfolio return. If a more conservative assumption was employed, MEABF’s liabilities would be higher and its funded ratio lower.\n\nRelated: See the Full 2017 Fiscal Strength Index Ranking of 116 US Cities\n\nBecause the ranking is based on 2015 financial audits — you can see the full data behind the scores here — it does not take into account more recent news. Last summer, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel announced a plan to resolve MEABF underfunding by raising water and sewer rates and increasing employee contributions to the system. Because these changes don’t take effect until this year, it will take some time for them to impact Chicago’s audited financial statements and their fiscal health scores.\n\nWhile Chicago’s place at the bottom of the list is unsurprising, New York City’s position — just one step above — was unexpected. An extended bull market and soaring real estate prices have pumped money into the Big Apple’s coffers. Total municipal revenues rose from $60 billion in 2009 to $81 billion in 2015. But the city has been spending the money almost as quickly as it has been coming in.\n\nAt the end of its 2015 fiscal year, the city’s general fund reserves amounted to just 0.67 percent of expenditures — well below the Government Finance Officers Association recommendation of 16.67 percent (equivalent to two months of spending). A city’s general fund is roughly analogous to an individual’s checking account.\n\nRelated: The Financial Health of All 50 States, Ranked\n\nNew York City also carries a very heavy debt burden. According to a report issued by City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York’s per capita debt greatly exceeds that of all other large U.S. cities, and is even 50 percent higher than that of Chicago. But the comptroller’s report only focuses on bonded debt. Government financial accounting standards require cities to report other long-term obligations such as pensions, compensated absences for municipal employees (accrued sick and vacation leave payable at retirement) and “other post-employment benefits” (or OPEB).\n\nIt is New York’s OPEB obligation that really sets the Big Apple apart. In 2015, the city’s OPEB liability was $85 billion — roughly equivalent to its bonded debt.\n\nThe large OPEB liability is driven by the size of the city’s workforce and the relatively high cost of health care in New York. According to its most recent OPEB Actuarial Report, the city is providing retiree health benefits to 222,000 retirees, while another 315,000 current and separated employees are potentially eligible for future benefits. In 2015, benefits per retiree ranged as high as $17,000 a year (for workers who were not yet Medicare-eligible and who had eligible dependents).\n\nHigh debt burdens and insufficient general fund reserves are associated with episodes of fiscal distress, which are marked by employee furloughs, layoffs and, in extreme cases, bond defaults and bankruptcy filings. Still, if New York City continues to record strong revenue growth, it can shoulder its sizeable obligations. With the stock market perking up in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory, the odds of a fiscal crisis in the near term appear long — but a bear market could place the city in jeopardy.\n\nRelated: Is Your State the Next Puerto Rico?\n\nSuch was the case back in 1933, when New York City briefly defaulted on its municipal bond debt. In the aftermath of the stock market crash and the Great Depression, city revenues declined amidst a rash of property tax delinquencies. The city faced a second fiscal meltdown in 1975, when the federal government refused to provide a bailout and the state declared a moratorium on certain city bond payments. Although the default occurred during another bear market, the proximate cause of the crisis was rising interest rates. At the time, the city relied heavily on short-term debt, which became more difficult and expensive to roll over as inflation spiked in the early 1970s.\n\nAside from New York and Chicago, three other cities received scores below 40: Reno, St. Louis and Toledo. All three of these cities had relatively small general fund balances and high debt burdens.\n\nOne Perfect Score\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, with a perfect score of 100, is Irvine, California — a rapidly growing “edge city” south of Los Angeles. Rising revenues have resulted in a series of budget surpluses that have bulked up the city’s reserves. In 2015, the city reported over $700 million of cash and investments on its balance sheet, more than enough to fund two years of government spending. Irvine is also unique among large American cities in that it has no outstanding bond obligations. All municipal borrowing in Irvine is done by special districts, which levy supplemental taxes to service their debt.\n\nTwo cities in California’s Inland Empire, Fontana and Moreno Valley, took the second and third spots. Both cities have modest debt loads and large general fund reserves.\n\nRelated: The Worst States for Retirement 2016​​​\n\nThese high-ranking cities are both located within a short drive from San Bernardino, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012. Their presence near the top of the list is testimony to California’s economic recovery, but it also suggests that sound financial management practices make a difference. Although Fontana and Moreno Valley faced similar challenges to San Bernardino during the Great Recession, both of these cities avoided a fiscal crisis – apparently because officials showed greater discipline with respect to spending and borrowing.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that it is not necessary for a city to have a near-perfect score to be regarded as a good fiscal steward. Any score higher than 70 could reasonably be interpreted as a level of fiscal health sufficient to justify a triple-A credit rating.\n\nBankruptcies and Delinquencies\n\nThe universe of cities we analyzed includes three that filed for bankruptcy since the Great Recession: Stockton and San Bernardino, which filed in 2012, and Detroit which filed in 2013. Both Stockton and Detroit have emerged from bankruptcy, while San Bernardino is close to doing so. All three cities have scores in the middle of the pack. Detroit and Stockton benefited from court-mandated reductions in their debt, while San Bernardino has been running general fund surpluses during its extended time in bankruptcy.\n\nOf the 116 cities we analyzed, three had not published 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports by the end of 2016. One of them, Baltimore, will publish its 2015 CAFR in early 2017, which is quite late. Federal regulations require state and local governments that receive over $750,000 in federal funds to file audited financial statements no later than nine months after their fiscal year end. Since Baltimore’s fiscal year ends on June 30, it should have filed its 2015 CAFR no later than March 31, 2016.\n\nSee the full ranking of 116 cities here.

    "text": "With senior Republicans all but begging President-elect Donald Trump to accept and act on intelligence agencies’ unanimous finding that Russia interfered in the recent presidential election, over the weekend, Trump and his closest advisers continued to blatantly misrepresent the contents of the intelligence services’ public statements.\n\nA joint report from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Agency left no doubt that US officials believe that Russian agents, acting on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, stole information from prominent Democrats and the Democratic National Committee and delivered it to WikiLeaks, which made the information public. Further, they are also unanimous in their belief that Russia did so with the express intention of harming Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump.\n\nRelated: Is Trump Headed for a Showdown With America’s Spy Agencies?\n\nThe report is also very specific about what the three agencies did not try to do.\n\nOn the very first page of the report is this unambiguous statement: “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.”\n\nThat has not stopped Trump and his inner circle from brazenly and repeatedly claiming the exact opposite.\n\n“Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!” Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nRelated: Trump Sides with WikiLeaks’ Assange Against US Intel Community\n\nOn Sunday, Trump’s former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on several talk shows and discussed testimony that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had delivered to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n\nClapper, after making it plain that the Intelligence Community believes with absolute certainty that Russia interfered in the election to hurt Clinton and help Trump, was asked if the agencies had determined whether or not the effort was successful.\n\nHere’s what Clapper said: “The intelligence community can’t gauge the impact [Russia's efforts] had on the choices the electorate made.”\n\nHere’s how Conway characterized his testimony: “Mr. Clapper, in his testimony, made very clear on Thursday, under oath, that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed.”\n\nRelated: Trump and the GOP Are On a Collision Course over Russian Sanctions\n\nAlso on Sunday, Conway addressed the written report in which the intelligence agencies specifically said they were making no determination whatsoever about whether the hacks impacted the outcome of the election.\n\n“They did not succeed in throwing this election to Donald Trump,” Conway said. “That is very clear in this report.”\n\nThe thin reed that Conway and Trump appear to be grasping onto is the finding that there was no actual Russian hacking of the machines used to tally votes nationwide. But there is nobody claiming there was, and it beggars credibility to claim that that is the only way to influence the outcome of an election.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will serve as Trump’s White House Chief of Staff, also made the rounds on Sunday. And while he didn’t claim that the intelligence agencies found there was no impact, he did repeatedly contradict another of their specific findings.\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nSpeaking with Chris Wallace on Fox News, he said that Trump accepts the general finding that Russia was hacking computers in the U.S. during the election, but characterized it as a run-of-the-mill piece of espionage.\n\n“This is something that's been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians. It happens every election period,” he said. Priebus made similarly dismissive comments about the attacks in an interview on CBS later Sunday morning.\n\nBut that’s exactly the opposite of how the intelligence agencies characterized Russia’s interference in the November 8, 2016, election.\n\nThe attacks and leaks to the media, they said, represented “a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.” Further, they added, “Moscow’s use of disclosures during the U.S. election was unprecedented.”\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nIn an appearance on Meet the Press, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunchly conservative Republican and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, offered his theory of why Trump and his advisors seem determined to undercut the findings of the Intelligence Community.\n\nTrump, he said, appears “worried” that any further investigation into Russia’s influence over the election might “undermine his credibility and legitimacy” as president. However, Graham said, “I haven’t heard any Democrat of prominence say ‘We doubt Donald Trump won.’”\n\nThe point of an investigation, he said, is to send a message to Russia that further interference in U.S. elections is unacceptable and will be met with harsh punishment.\n\n“If after having been briefed by our intelligence leaders, Donald Trump is still unsure as to what the Russians did, that would be incredibly unnerving to me because the evidence is overwhelming,” Graham said. “All I’m asking him is to acknowledge that Russia interfered and to push back...It was Democrats today. It could be Republicans in the next election.”\n\nIf Trump fails to do that, Graham said, “that will shake me to my core about his judgment.”"

    "text": "In just two weeks, Donald Trump is going to come face to face with the reality of serving in the office he managed to win in the November election. And while he may face some rude awakenings with regard to the demands -- and limits -- of the job, he won’t be the only one coming to grips with unpleasant facts.\n\nSooner or later, Trump’s voters are going to learn that a lot of the president-elect’s campaign promises are not going to be kept, either because Congress won’t allow it or because they were never really feasible in the first place.\n\nRelated: Air Force to Trump: Sorry, but the F-18 Can’t Replace the F-35\n\nThe list of unlikely things Trump said he would do is a long one, but here are a few of the most high-profile campaign trail promises he made that he has either already backtracked on or will almost certainly be forced to abandon.\n\n1. Build a wall and make Mexico pay for it\n\nThis was Trump’s go-to promise from the very beginning of the Republican primaries. Not only would he build a giant wall across the entire border between the United States and Mexico, he would also use his superior business skills to get the Mexican government to foot the bill.\n\nTrump’s wall promise began to crumble before the campaign was even over, as he reluctantly admitted that the wall would actually be more of a fence in many places and that in others it would make sense to simply allow natural barriers to do the work.\n\nOn Friday, though, news broke that the Trump team plans to ask Congress to appropriate funds for the wall’s construction, meaning that U.S. taxpayer dollars -- not pesos from Mexico City -- will be paying for it. Trump erupted on Twitter, writing “The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!”\n\nPeople who have been following Trump in the campaign have a pretty good idea by now what to expect when the president-elect promises something will happen “later.” (See: Tax returns, release of.)\n\nRelated: Here’s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\n2. Mass deportations\n\nThe anti-immigrant animus of Trump’s base of support was evident early and consistently throughout his campaign. Trump regularly fanned its flames with the promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nHe suggested the formation of a “deportation force” and repeatedly made vows such as this, from September 2015: “I will get them out so fast that your head would spin, long before I even can start the wall,\" Trump said. \"They will be out of here. You know we have tremendous problems of crime.\"\n\nAt the time, he said he believed all of the undocumented immigrants could be out of the country within 18 months to two years.\n\nThis is never going to happen. Multiple experts have pointed out that it would require tens of thousands of deportations a day, every day, for two years. Even respecting only the most basic due process rights of prospective deportees would make this utterly impossible. And logistics aside, it’s not likely the American people would countenance the wholesale rounding up and incarceration of families on suspicion of being undocumented.\n\n3. Congressional term limits\n\nThis one was never going to happen either. First of all, the Supreme Court has ruled Congressional term limits unconstitutional, meaning that creating them would require a constitutional amendment. And unless Trump calls a constitutional convention, which hasn’t happened since 1787, that amendment would have to go through Congress. Trump is simply not going to get members of Congress to pass a law that puts them out of a job.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here’s How Much It’ll Cost\n\n“I would say we have term limits now,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters after Trump was chosen as the next president. “They’re called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate.”\n\n4. Lock her up!\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump regularly called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a criminal and suggested that she would face investigation by law enforcement if he were elected president. This led to the fantasy among many his supporters of seeing Clinton in a prison jumpsuit, and loud chants of “Lock her up! Lock her up!” at Trump rallies.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Trump to let his supporters down on this one. Within days of winning the election, he made it plain that he had no interest in pursuing Clinton for the vast array of crimes he accused her of during the campaign.\n\n5. Drain the swamp\n\nTrump promised to root out crony capitalism and to diminish the influence of Wall Street on Washington once he entered the White House. At his rallies, he promised to “drain the swamp,” a phrase that entered his supporters’ repertoire of rally chants, along with “Build the wall!” and “Lock her up!”\n\nBut from the look of Trump’s cabinet nominations and his set of close advisers, all those people in “Make America Great Again” hats may as well have spent their time chanting “Goldman Sachs! Goldman Sachs!”\n\nTrump has hired billionaires, campaign donors and current and former Wall Street bankers to staff his administration, leading to many jokes about how his version of draining the swamp looks more like gentrifying it with a better class of alligators.\n\nThat Trump can’t and won’t keep his campaign promises really ought not to surprise anybody, given the vast amount of evidence that was presented during the campaign about his willingness to back out of deals, abandon partners and stiff creditors. But it probably will nonetheless."

    "text": "Republicans in Washington began their era of total control over the levers of power by stepping on a rake. In a secret vote last week, the Republican conference in the House of Representatives decided to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics, igniting a firestorm of public opposition that forced them into an embarrassing retreat on the very first day of the 115th Congress.\n\nAs political miscalculations go, it was a doozy. That day, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called it “the dumbest fricking thing I’ve ever heard.”\n\nRelated: Seven Tests That Can Keep Republicans from Screwing Up\n\nThe question for Republicans now is whether they’ve learned something from the experience or not. The party has a history, in recent years, of treating control of some or all of the nation’s policymaking apparatus as an opportunity to enact massive changes that don’t always have the level of public support that they seem to believe.\n\nGovernment shutdowns are an obvious example. As Newt Gingrich in 1995 and Ted Cruz in 2013 both learned, holding the entire federal government hostage to a narrow political goal is frowned upon by the majority of Americans.\n\nIn 2005, fresh off his reelection victory and looking at Republican majorities in the House and Senate, George W. Bush rolled out privatization of Social Security as his top domestic priority. It was beaten back amid howls of public protest and helped Democrats take over both houses of Congress just two years later.\n\nWhether The 115th Congress and President Trump will overreach politically in the coming years is, obviously, not yet known. But there will be plenty of opportunities. Here are a few areas where Republicans should scan the ground for more rakes before rushing forward.\n\nRelated: Most Americans Don’t Want to Repeal Obamacare: Here’s What They Want Instead\n\nObamacare Repeal\n\nThe Republicans’ call for repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act during the 2016 campaign clearly was a smart political tactic that paid off big dividends in the November election. But in their haste to make that one of their first orders of business, congressional leaders and President-elect Donald Trump are moving into politically treacherous and largely uncharted waters.\n\nWith the possible exception of some of the changes in the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress has never before dismantled a major social service or health care program in modern times. For sure, Obamacare was plagued from the beginning by operational and financial problems, overpromising by President Obama, and faulty business models that ended up driving major insurers out of the market and driving up premiums and copayments for consumers.\n\nBut the four-year-old subsidized healthcare insurance system that Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) denounce as a “disaster” and “failed partisan experiment” has extended first-time coverage to 20 million Americans through subsidized private insurance policies and expanded Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia. It has also raised the standards of coverage in most policies, helped bend the national health care cost curve, provided added relief to rural hospitals and created a bonanza of new business for many insurers, hospitals and medical facilities, pharmaceutical companies and others.\n\nEven without a suitable replacement in hand after years of attacking the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are on track to use special budget “reconciliation” rules to ram through a resolution in the coming months that would pull much of the Obamacare program up by the roots.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nYet surveys show that Americans are more interested in Congress fixing Obamacare than replacing it with an entirely new program. And for all their complaints about President Obama’s signature health insurance plan, most of the major players in the healthcare world are warning that the GOP strategy will lead to major financial losses for insurers and hospitals and the loss of coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nWhat’s more, GOP political allies including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Republican governors whose states expanded Medicaid under Obamacare are pressuring Congress to postpone the repeal legislation until a feasible substitute is in hand.\n\nGOP leaders have shrugged off the warnings and insist that rapid action is essential in order for Trump and the congressional Republicans to make good on their political promises to voters. Yet already there are tiny fissures developing within the GOP over strategy. Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Bob Corker of Tennessee are all raising concerns about repealing Obamacare without a replacement and other issues related to the fiscal 2017 budget resolution being used as the main vehicle.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\nSpending and the Debt\n\nTrump once boasted that he could retire the nearly $20 trillion national debt in eight years through his tax cuts, budget savings and renegotiated trade deals with China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nYet throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, he sought to overshadow Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with promises of massive tax cuts, $1 trillion of new infrastructure investment, a military buildup, affordable child care and family leave benefits.\n\nRepublicans have long prided themselves as the party of fiscal conservatism and balanced budgets. But in the early going of the new Congress, Trump and the GOP seem to be prepared to break the bank in pursuit of Trump’s ambitious agenda. Even before taking office as president, Trump has expanded on his government spending ambitions, boasting that he was prepared to renew a costly nuclear arms race with Russia, China and other nuclear powers.\n\nLate last week, Politico reported that Trump’s team and Republican lawmakers are considering adding funds to a must-pass spending bill this spring to help finance his plans to build a wall along the southern border after concluding that Trump can’t make good on a major campaign pledge to force Mexico to pay for it. That idea alone would add billions of dollars to the government appropriations bills in the coming years.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that when taken together, Trump’s tax and spending promises – including his pledge to boost military spending and make cuts in non-defense discretionary programs-- would drive up the debt to 105 percent of GDP within a decade, or one of the highest levels since World War II.\n\nBut that analysis didn’t include the cost of a major increase in highway, bridge and other infrastructure spending because Trump’s advisers have yet to figure out how to finance it. And the long term economic and budgetary impact of the Republicans’ drive to repeal and replace Obamacare are still open to conjecture.\n\nRepublicans are hijacking the fiscal 2017 budget resolution to use as the vehicle for dismantling much of Obamacare. While all eyes are focused on the political fight over repealing Obamacare, there has been little discussion about the spending and deficit numbers that Republicans have plugged in as place holders until Congress can fully turn its attention to spending levels later this year, when a second resolution will be offered to members.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is one of the few Republicans who has made an issue of this tactic, urging fiscal conservatives in the House and Senate to balk at approving a budget resolution repealing Obamacare that on the surface, at least, allows the debt to rise by $9.7 trillion in the coming decade because of major tax cuts and spending increases. “It should be a conservative document that should not add $9.7 trillion to the debt over ten years,” Paul told reporters late last week after meeting with two dozen conservative House Republicans who belong to the Freedom Caucus.\n\nRelated: Trump Wants a Much Bigger Navy: Here’s How Much It’ll Cost\n\nBixby, the Concord Coalition official and deficit hawk, calls all of this “very concerning” for fiscal conservatives.\n\n“There are a lot of chickens coming home to roost here,” he said in an interview Friday. “A lot of campaign promises were made and they didn’t add up. And now that we’re heading into budget season, lawmakers and the new administration are trying to perform some fiscal alchemy here to make it all work.”\n\n“The tough things for Republicans is that a lot of them are beginning to realize that they are faced with either scaling back substantially some of their campaign promises or scaling back their concern about the debt,” he added. “The tension we are seeing now is whether they can accommodate big spending plans and a big tax cut and still go to their constituents with a straight face and say they’re worried about the debt.”\n\nSocial Issues\n\nThere are many, many Americans who are extremely socially conservative, and they are already cheering an effort by Republican lawmakers to shoehorn language that strips all federal funding from Planned Parenthood into the budget bill repealing Obamacare. But a Congress that dedicates itself to the agenda of social conservatives will likely find itself at odds with a broader American electorate that is increasingly less concerned about such issues.\n\nRelated: Here’s What Americans Want Most to Hear from President Trump\n\nPlanned Parenthood is just one example, but it’s a good one. Poll after poll after poll has shown that the organization, which provides health care services to women around the country, many of whom might not be able to access reproductive care otherwise, is extremely popular.\n\nWith Republicans in charge of both the White House and the Senate, the possibility of manufacturing a Supreme Court majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, clearing the way to make abortion illegal, is another near-term goal for social conservatives. And while doing so would make a portion of the Republican electorate rapturously happy, it would be extraordinarily unpopular among the majority of Americans.\n\nSo would laws rolling back protections for LGBTQ Americans. While gay marriage and anti-discrimination laws remain a flashpoint for the religious right, the rest of the United States has, for the most part, moved on. A Congress seen as focused on giving federal blessing to things like North Carolina’s disastrously controversial “bathroom bill” would eventually find itself in a position similar to that state’s now-former Governor."

    "text": "While the public has long agreed with President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans that the Affordable Care Act is badly flawed and requires major surgery, far more Americans believe the program should be kept but improved than repealed and replaced.\n\nShortly after Trump’s stunning November 8 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton – an ardent champion of Obamacare -- a Gallup poll found that while slightly more than half of Americans continued to express dissatisfaction with the program, 57 percent said they either wanted to keep the law as is or wanted to keep it and change the law significantly. Just 37 percent wanted to repeal and replace it as the Republicans have vowed to do.\n\nRelated: Could Rand Paul End Up Saving Obamacare?\n\nNot surprisingly, views differ sharply between Republican and Democratic voters, reflecting the larger political divide throughout the country and in Washington. Seventy-one percent of Republicans told Gallup they disapprove of the law and want it repealed, while 59 percent of Democrats want to keep it with significant changes.\n\nTaken together, the findings suggest a national unease among Americans over GOP leaders’ determination to pass a budget resolution in the coming weeks that would repeal President Obama’s signature national health insurance program that – for all its flaws – has provided coverage to more than 20 million Americans in recent years.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have joined Trump in denouncing Obamacare as irredeemable. They have vowed rapid legislative action in the coming weeks and months to repeal the law, even while the party is far from a consensus on replacement legislation.\n\n“Obamacare is a disaster,” Ryan said. “Insurance markets are collapsing. Premiums are soaring. Patients’ choices are dwindling. The law has failed to deliver on its core promises, hurting far more than it is helping.”\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\nGOP leaders, for now, intend to repeal the program by the spring while setting the effective date a year or two down the road while Republican lawmakers hammer out a comprehensive alternative program that depends on more on market forces than government intervention and subsidies.\n\nYet that strategy is being met with opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors, drug companies, consumer advocates and even many Republican governors who fear chaos and a collapse of Obamacare while the Republicans struggle to map out a new approach.\n\nJust this week, the American Medical Association (AMA), the premier physician organization, wrote a letter to Republican leaders warning against jeopardizing the health care coverage of millions of Americans by abruptly repealing Obamacare without a suitable replacement. And Republican Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan hailed the success of his state’s expansion of Medicaid that was made possible by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA dozen moderate Democratic senators, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton’s vice presidential running mate, wrote to the GOP leadership yesterday urging them to slow down and work with them to draft changes to the existing law to address concerns such as soaring premium and onerous taxes and mandates.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\n“There is so much we can immediately improve, but by pushing an immediate repeal through a partisan budget process, we won’t have the opportunity to work together to build on that common ground,” Kaine said, according to The New York Times.\n\nG. William Hoagland, a vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Senate Republican budget expert, said that the Republicans are still caught up in their campaign slogans and enthusiasm and aren’t being pragmatic. However, reality will begin to set in when House and Senate committees begin stitching together the specific budget instructions to dismantle Obamacare, and many divisive issues rise to the surface, he said.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\n“Campaign rhetoric is one thing and legislating is another thing,” Hoagland said in an interview Friday. “And I think the word ‘repeal’ is maybe being overused here by the Republicans – even before President-elect Trump is sworn in. What people are really talking about is amending the Affordable Care Act.”\n\nHoagland, a health care policy expert, suggested that there is plenty of room for bipartisan compromise on changes to Obamacare, including adding Trump’s proposals for lowering barriers to interstate sales of health insurance and the establishment of health care savings accounts. The biggest sticking point between Republicans and Democrats will be over how to subsidize health care costs for low-income Americans through the federal tax code and whether to make coverage mandatory or voluntary.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act mandates uninsured Americans to acquire coverage or pay the penalty. Ryan and others say their goal is to replace Obamacare with a law that guarantees “universal access” to health care coverage, but not necessarily to force everyone to be covered. Ryan yesterday declined to speculate on whether the 20 million or more Americans currently receiving coverage under the Affordable Care Act would continue to receive coverage under the GOP approach.\n\nThere is another obstacle for the Republicans in completely reinventing a national health insurance program: the cost. Blowing up Obamacare and starting from scratch would be a very costly enterprise. A complete repeal would include getting rid of a dozen major tax provisions that help underwrite the program’s operating costs.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nBefore the election, the Congressional Budget Office projected that Obamacare operating costs would total $1.24 trillion between 2019 and 2026. There is compelling evidence that if the Republicans scrap all of the Obamacare taxes, they could raise at most $850 billion of the total required cost through a number of budgetary and tax policy maneuvers, according to a recent Brookings Institution analysis.\n\nFor these and other reasons, Hoagland says he could imagine a bipartisan deal next summer or fall that would retain the basic framework of Obamacare while layering in GOP provisions and innovations. He said that it would give Trump the opportunity to show off his legendary bargaining skills.\n\n“The more I look at it . . . the more I sense that we’re really talking about what you might call Trumpcare One or Trumpcare Two – Trumpcare modification of Obamacare,” Hoagland said. “It just seems to me we’re dealing with rhetoric right now and we’re still in the campaign mode.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/06/Air-Force-Trump-Sorry-F-18-Can-t-Replace-F-35",
    "text": "It took a few weeks -- possibly to recover from the shock -- but top officials in the Pentagon are finally publicly pushing back against President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal in December to do away with the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and replace the fifth-generation fighter plane with a souped-up version of the F-18 Super Hornet.\n\nThe suggestion to completely overhaul the military’s vision for the future of jet fighters was made in a tweet, as with many of Trump’s policy statements. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet!” Trump wrote.\n\nRelated: Air Force General Challenges Trump Over the F-35\n\nThe suggestion was met with immediate derision within the defense community, but Pentagon officials generally kept their criticism low-key, pointing out that the technology and design differences between the F-18 and F-35 are vast, and that an F-18 that is “comparable” to an F-35 would require such a massive overhaul that it really wouldn’t be an F-18 anymore.\n\nThis week, though, some of the criticism got a bit louder. In an interview reported on Thursday by DefenseNews, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said, “The Air Force does not view the F/A-18 and the F-35 to be substitutable at all. They fulfill different requirements. They’re both fine aircraft, don’t get me wrong. But it’s fourth generation, and F-35 is fifth generation.”\n\nOn Friday morning, speaking in northern Virginia at a meeting of the Air Force Association, James repeated her criticism. Referring to the F-18, she said, “It's a fine aircraft, it's a different aircraft, it does not fulfill the same requirements ... It's a little bit apples and oranges and I have to believe before any final decision would be made with respect to a final shift, the chief requirements officer would be consulted.”\n\nOthers were not as diplomatic. Speaking to Business Insider about the idea that the F-18 could be transformed into something comparable to the F-35, US Marine Corps Lt. Col David \"Chip\" Berke, a pilot who has flown both planes, called the idea “preposterous” and “laughable.”\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Is Planning a New Super Rival to the Troubled F-35\n\nAmong the most significant differences is that the F-35 was designed from the ground up to be a stealth fighter, meaning that it is extremely difficult to spot using radar. The F-18 is not a stealth aircraft.\n\n“The radar cross-section of an F-18 is the radar cross-section of an F-18 — you can’t change that,” said Air Force Brigadier General Scott Pleus this week, according to Military.com. Pleus directs the F-35 program’s integration office. “Low observable technology, the ability to evade radar if you will, is something that has to be designed into the airplane from the very beginning.”"

    "text": "Congressional Democrats are planning a blizzard of publicity events and delaying tactics to try to block the Republicans’ drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the coming weeks, although few give them much chance of success.\n\nArguably the Democrats’ longest of long-shots in slowing or sidetracking the Obamacare repeal legislation is the effort of Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian, free-spirted Republican from Kentucky who unsuccessfully challenged Donald Trump for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nPaul, 53, is one of at least three Republican senators who have said it might be a colossal mistake for the Republicans to forge ahead with repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan ready in the wings to avert upheaval in the health insurance industry and prevent millions of Americans from losing their coverage.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink\n\n“We should repeal Obamacare, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and may eventually lead to calls for a taxpayer bailout of insurance companies,” he wrote recently.\n\nTwo other more moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also voiced concern that reckless action now by the GOP could leave millions of Americans in the lurch and trigger political retribution against their party. But Paul was the only Senate Republican to vote on Wednesday against beginning the complex “reconciliation” budget process that will culminate in a final vote to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThen on Thursday, he attempted to up the ante with a morning meeting with nearly two dozen arch conservatives in the House — members of the Freedom Caucus — to discuss possible opposition strategies. Freedom Caucus members are universally opposed to Obamacare and have long called for its repeal. However, many of those members are also ideological purists on the subject of budgets and spending and are opposed to almost anything that raises the spending caps and drives up the now $19.9 trillion national debt.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nPaul argued that the fiscal 2017 budget resolution that the leadership just placed on a fast track to passage by a simple majority vote not only would dismantle key sections of Obamacare, but theoretically would permit major tax cuts and spending that could increase the debt by $9.7 trillion over the coming decade.\n\n“I want to make sure that conservatives in the House knew that together we can have some power and impact on what the budget will be, that the budget is a Republican document, there will be no Democrats on board,” Paul told reporters after the meeting. “It should be a conservative document that should not add $9.7 trillion to the debt over 10 years.”\n\nRoss Baker, a political scientist and congressional expert at Rutgers University, said yesterday that it’s hard to imagine that Trump’s proposed combination of tax cuts and $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure spending would please House conservatives. “So I think Paul sees an opportunity to make some converts,” Baker said. “At this point they may just take a wait-and-see attitude and then decide later their feelings about Trump’s spending and taxing plans.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nAlthough the GOP holds a solid 247-to-188 majority in the House, a defection by 24 members of the Freedom Caucus could derail House Speaker Paul Ryan’s crusade to repeal Obamacare, just as a defection by Paul and two other Senate Republicans could give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) fits in steering repeal through the Senate.\n\nBut as The Washington Post reported yesterday after Paul’s meeting with the Freedom Caucus, “Few of the House’s staunch conservatives were ready to pull the trigger.”\n\nRep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) told reporters that “I just came to understand all the different ideas about where we go next,” but added that he would probably vote for the budget resolution.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) said his group hasn’t made a decision whether to support the budget resolution or not. However, he argued that it would be far preferable to simultaneously repeal and replace Obamacare instead of putting off a decision on a new program for months or even years, as many GOP leaders have suggested.\n\nHowever, after what the Post described as a “collective shrug” from House conservatives this time, Paul may find himself on a lonely quest. During a news conference yesterday, Ryan told reporters he was “really not concerned” about Paul’s intervention in internal House GOP policy-making. He said his members know that a second, fiscal 2018 budget resolution will be introduced next fall that would address concerns about a rising debt.\n\n“This is a repeal resolution,” he said of the pending budget legislation. “Our members fully understand that. We’ve been planning for this for quite some time. The full budget resolution — the traditional budget resolution — will occur this fall, like it always does. And our members understand this process.”\n\nRyan indicated that the GOP would have a replacement plan in hand before the end of this year. However, he declined to commit when asked if the Republican plan would allow everyone covered through Obamacare to remain insured.\n\nAn aide to the Senate Budget Committee agreed with Ryan that the fiscal 2018 budget will be a comprehensive plan “that will put our fiscal house in order.” He added that, the current budget resolution would at least provide $2 billion in savings for deficit reduction. “And we know repeal will generate a lot more savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office,” he added."

    "text": "President-elect Trump’s choice of Robert Lighthizer as his special trade representative, announced Tuesday afternoon, completes the first string of the new administration’s trade team. So it’s time to draw a couple of clear conclusions.\n\nConclusion No. 1: Trump is a dead-serious hawk on trade questions—all in for everything he promised on the campaign trail. Prominent among these promises is a remake of economic relations with China and a halt to the southward drain of American jobs—“the giant sucking sound,” as Ross Perot put it during his 1992 presidential run—to Mexico.\n\nRelated: Trump Completes His Trade Triumvirate with Former Reagan Hand\n\nConclusion No. 2: Trump’s trade hawks have three alternatives: They can learn on the job and backtrack on the campaign pledges, they can limit themselves to jawboning and gestures, or they can sustain bloody noses.\n\nThere is one other possibility: Trump’s trade team can make an unholy mess of the U.S.–China relationship altogether if they take their animus too far and disputes spill into already-fraught security questions.\n\nWhat Trump will not be able to do, for better or worse, is fundamentally alter the structure of U.S.–China trade or Mexico’s role as a low-cost manufacturing platform. Encouraged by the U.S. in the first place, too many people here and there benefit from these arrangements to alter them now.\n\nLighthizer, a protectionist from way back, has a decades-long record as a China-basher. When he served as President Reagan’s deputy S.T.R. in the 1980s, Japan was Public Enemy No. 1 and Lighthizer’s office wielded threats of import quotas and punitive tariffs—the latter now prominent on Trump’s menu.\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\nLighthizer joins Wilbur Ross, commerce secretary-designate, and a practiced hand at Rust Belt salvage jobs, and Peter Navarro, head of the newly created National Trade Council and another hard-liner on trade. Navarro, a University of California economist, is noted for his 2012 documentary, “Death by China.”\n\nSome near-term successes are in store for this crew. Trump’s on the record opposing the sweeping trade deals negotiated under Presidents Clinton and Obama, and they’re both vulnerable to one or another degree.\n\nObama’s Trans–Pacific Partnership, ambitious to a fault and structured in secret by the corporations that would have benefited from it, is all but a dead letter already. Clinton’s North American Free Trade Agreement— Trump called it “the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country” during the debates last year—is plainly in Trump’s sights.\n\nOn this score Trump is right. Even the Mexicans now acknowledge NAFTA simply hasn’t delivered many of its promised benefits. As to the TTP, look at it carefully—to the extent one can—and it is less a trade deal than a sweeping deregulation regime that will prove as much a letdown as its predecessor.\n\nRelated: Why GOP Leaders Are Balking at Trump’s Call for Punitive Tariffs\n\nTrump’s pulling a Ross Perot act, in effect—saying the unsayable. These accords are structured to benefit corporations at the expense of jobs, wages, and workplace security on both sides of the border. It won’t do—as Trump’s stunning victory last November 8 has just advised us.\n\nScrapping the TTP will actually do relations with Beijing some good, given the Obama administration wielded it as an economic weapon intended to isolate the Chinese. As to NAFTA, Team Trump will have to limit its ambitions to adjustments, and even those that are justified are likely to prove hard to make.\n\nThe big problem with Trump’s aggressive position on China is very simple: China’s not the problem. America’s traditional short-sightedness is the problem.\n\nWhen Deng Xiaoping’s reforms unleashed pent-up energies in the early 1980s, U.S. companies piled in big time. Here was a low-wage production platform from which they could export to developed markets, including their own. Complex supply chains and multiple-site assembly operations now make a very dense weave.\n\nRelated: Trump Will Be Steadier on China Than His Taiwan Call May Suggest\n\nAmericans did the same thing in Japan after the 1945 victory, and by the 1980s—Lighthizer’s time in the Reagan administration—the strategy was biting U.S. companies on their backsides. Imbalances in the economic relationship with China are nothing more than a not-quite-instant replay of earlier events across the Pacific.\n\nThe lessons then are the lessons now.\n\nFirst, Washington can ask the Chinese to make ameliorating adjustments at the margins, but China will never abandon its fundamental growth strategy, which is to export into prosperity while the domestic market begins to mature.\n\nSecond, America has to make the serious adjustments. China’s economic rise has cost the U.S. jobs while treating the American workforce with benign neglect. The government invested too little in education and compensatory retraining programs, to name two.\n\nNow, it’s worth noting, we’re sending overseas a lot of the higher-tech jobs workers who lost their jobs to Deng’s reforms. There’s no laying any of this off on China.\n\nLet Team Trump shout loudly, save some jobs as the President-elect has with Carrier and now Ford, and tell the folks back home, “I’m tryin’ my best.” A sophisticated ambassador in Beijing can smooth the ruffles at the other end."

    "text": "For a nation that isn’t officially at war against another nation, the United States dropped an awful lot of bombs on a pretty large number of countries last year, according to research by Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and research associate Jennifer Wilson.\n\nAccording to their calculations, based on data released by the Pentagon as well as information collected by think tanks and news organizations, the U.S. dropped some 26,171 bombs across all its weapons platforms, on targets in seven different countries.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays War Games on Twitter, and Americans Are Getting Worried\n\nThe biggest recipients were Syria (12,192) and Iraq (12,095), where the U.S. is participating in the effort to destroy the terror group ISIS, which still controls parts of both countries.\n\nNext on the list was Afghanistan where, despite having pulled out the vast majority of combat troops years ago, the U.S. saw the need to drop 1,337 bombs. The only other country in triple digits was Libya, which was hit with 496.\n\nSmaller targets included Yemen (34), Somalia (14) and Pakistan (3). The total number of bombs dropped was up 3,027 over the previous year, they found.\n\nRelated: The VA Doesn’t Need to Be Privatized, and Our Vets Know It\n\nWriting on his blog, Zenko admits, “This estimate is undoubtedly low, considering reliable data is only available for airstrikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya, and a single ‘strike,’ according to the Pentagon’s definition, can involve multiple bombs or munitions.”\n\nZenko added, “As President Obama enters the final weeks of his presidency, there will be ample assessments of his foreign military approach, which has focused on reducing U.S. ground combat troops (with the notable exception of the Afghanistan surge), supporting local security partners, and authorizing the expansive use of air power. Whether this strategy ‘works’—i.e. reduces the threat posed by extremists operating from those countries and improves overall security and governance on the ground—is highly contested. Yet, for better or worse, these are the central [tenets] of the Obama doctrine.”"

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to maintain a naval fleet of 350 ships as part of an historic buildup of the U.S. military, but his ambitions come with a stiff price tag.\n\n“Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I,” he said during a campaign stop last October in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. “My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort.”\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nThe Navy on average has spent $15.9 billion annually on ship building over the past three decades, according to a new report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In order to meet the Republican president-elect’s goal, the navy shipbuilding account would have to be boosted to $25 billion a year, 60 percent higher than the historical average.\n\nThat will mean having to find a way to lift the budget cap on defense spending by about $9 billion a year.\n\nTrump is far from alone in his ambitions for expanding the U.S. fleet to counter Russia, China, Iran and other global adversaries. Last month, the Navy released a new force structure assessment – a blueprint for the future -- which calls for building a fleet of 355 ships. That is in sharp contrast to a previous long-term goal of 308 ships.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nAs of last November, the U.S. fleet numbered 272 battle force ships, according to CBO. That included aircraft carriers, submarines, surface combatants, amphibious ships, combat logistics ships and some support ships. The proposed buildup would include an additional aircraft carrier, more large warships and more attack submarines.\n\nIn outlining his views on the need for a defense buildup, Trump has stressed the economic benefits his policies will have in the private sector.\n\n“I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort,” Trump declared in his campaign speech last fall.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\n“As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more,” he added. “We will establish centers of excellence in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/05/Obamacare-Repeal-Could-Push-Rural-Hospitals-Brink",
    "text": "Many of the rural hospitals and health centers serving 62 million Americans have operated on a shoestring for years.\n\nSince January 2010, 80 rural hospitals and health care facilities that provided treatment to large numbers of elderly and low-income families were forced to close for financial reasons. More than 670 of the remaining 2,078 facilities are vulnerable or “at risk” of closure, according to hospital industry experts.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\nFor many of those hospitals, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a lifeline, providing millions of their patients with the financial wherewithal to obtain health care treatment and prescription drugs without having to turn to emergency rooms for assistance.\n\nBut as the new Republican Congress and GOP President-elect Donald Trump press to repeal Obamacare in the coming months with no suitable replacement in hand, rural hospital officials say they are facing a “triple whammy” of lost financial benefits that could force many of the remaining rural hospitals out of business in the coming decade.\n\n“We’re in the midst of a rural hospital closure crisis right now, and that is with the ACA currently in place,” Alan Morgan, the CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said in an interview Thursday. “Looking at our projections for where we’re headed, at the current rate we could see a third of all rural hospitals closed within the next decade.”\n\nThe advent of Obamacare enabled 1.7 million rural Americans to purchase subsidized private coverage on government operated exchanges last year, an 11 percent increase from 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Millions more obtained expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income adults in rural states that opted into the program under Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nNow the government-run health insurance exchanges and the expanded Medicaid program are on the chopping block on Capitol Hill, along with a third lesser known but highly important prescription drug discount program that is vital to the operation of more than a thousand rural hospitals.\n\nTucked away in the fine print of the ACA is a provision that obliges major drug companies to provide deep discounts to rural hospitals and other health care providers under the “340B” program first enacted by Congress in 1992. That law was originally designed to provide low-cost drugs to “social safety net” medical facilities operating in economically distressed regions of the country.\n\nIn drafting the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats specifically targeted 340B to hospitals in rural areas. The ACA designated 1,100 rural hospitals eligible for 340B coverage. Those facilities subsequently extracted major discounts from pharmaceutical companies for medicine used in treating outpatients who qualified for Medicaid.\n\nAccording to a report by Morning Consult, the 340B program is critical to the operation of many rural facilities because the drug cost savings can be used to fund essential medical services for their communities, such as emergency rooms, as well as sharply reducing the cost of medicine for indigent patients.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nFor example, the Cass County Memorial Hospital in Atlantic, Iowa, uses some of its 340B program savings to help fund the hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit, which is one of only two critical access hospitals in the entire state that offers psychiatric services. At the same time, the RiverView Health facility in Crookston, Minn., has used savings from drug purchases to recruit orthopedic surgeons and oncology specialists, according to the report.\n\nMorgan, the rural health association official, said that most rural hospitals have been “just operating on a break-even margin or at a loss in certain cases,” and can’t afford to lose any income source or coverage.\n\n“To be able to have these deep drug discounts was a great way to assure that access remained in the community,” he said. “The 340B provision doesn’t require that the savings be passed on to the community, but it’s just common practice that this form of discounting is going on.”\n\nThe loss of subsidized health insurance, expanded Medicaid for low-income people and the 340B mandate taken together would have a devastating impact on the remaining rural hospitals, Morgan warned.\n\n“If Congress were to proceed with an outright repeal with no replacement whatsoever, and they just ended these programs altogether, that would be the triple whammy,” he said."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/05/Trump-Headed-Showdown-America-s-Spy-Agencies",
    "text": "How incoming president Donald Trump will interact with the U.S. Intelligence Community is an increasingly urgent question given the threats that the nation and its interests face from terrorists and unfriendly state actors. Unfortunately, the mass of conflicting signals coming from both the president-elect and his team are only making the answer harder to discern.\n\nLate Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources close to the Trump transition team, reported that the incoming administration was expected to engineer a major shake-up of the IC infrastructure by greatly diminishing the role of the Director of National Intelligence and slimming down the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nRelated: Trump Sides with WikiLeaks’ Assange Against US Intel Community\n\nThe story seemed to fit comfortably into the available facts about Trump’s feelings toward the IC in general. Since the summer, when the various agencies got together and released a statement asserting their agreement that the Russian government was responsible for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic operatives, Trump has been dismissive and antagonistic about the nation’s spy agencies.\n\nHe also tapped retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a man with a notoriously difficult relationship with top intelligence officials, to be his National Security Advisor. Flynn was forced out of his job running the Defense Intelligence Agency by current DNI James Clapper, and has since become a full-throated critic of the IC as it exists today. Flynn also accepted payment for an appearance in Russia from the state propaganda network, RT, and was seated next to President Vladimir Putin at a celebratory dinner.\n\nWhen the IC went a step further and clarified that the agencies believe the Russian hacking was aimed at helping Trump during the election, the president-elect denied that the report was accurate, and slammed the CIA in particular for its mistaken claim in the early years of the George W. Bush administration that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted his displeasure with the IC again, writing, “The ‘Intelligence’ briefing on so-called ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!” He went on to favorably tweet about Wikileaks founder Julian Assange’s claim that the materials taken during the cyberattacks on Democrats did not come from Russia.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays War Games on Twitter, and Americans Are Getting Worried\n\nAdministration officials told news organizations that they were puzzled by the claim that the intelligence agencies had delayed the briefing, saying that it had always been scheduled for Friday. And intelligence officials were reported to be privately furious at the president-elect’s apparent decision to trust Assange over his own country’s intelligence services.\n\nBut Trump was back on Twitter Thursday morning, and his tone had changed somewhat. “The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against \"Intelligence\" when in fact I am a big fan!”\n\nA few hours later, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee staffer tapped to be press secretary in the Trump White House, issued a blanket denial about the Journal report. “There is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure,” he told reporters. “It is 100 percent false.”\n\nNotwithstanding Spicer’s comments, ABC News reported late Thursday morning that a “senior Trump transition official” said the overhaul actually is still on the table.\n\nRelated: Trump and the GOP Are On a Collision Course over Russian Sanctions\n\nWhile all this was going on, top intelligence officials Clapper, Marcel Lettre, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and Admiral Michael Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, were appearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee was supposed to focus on cyberthreats in general, but much of the discussion focused on the IC’s relationship with the incoming president and the allegations of Russian hacking affecting the election. The intelligence chiefs said that the IC stands behind its determination that Russia was involved in the hacks and that the operation was directed at the highest levels of the Kremlin.\n\nClapper, who will retire in just over two weeks, suggested that Trump’s attacks on the IC had gone beyond the realm of healthy skepticism into “disparagement” and said that he has been contacted by counterparts in other countries expressing concern about the president-elect’s apparent disdain for the work done by intelligence professionals.\n\nRogers said that he was concerned about losing talented staff who may decide not to work for a Trump administration if they believe that their work is not respected and their conclusions dismissed without any consideration.\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nAll this comes as Trump is reportedly refusing his daily intelligence briefings, meeting instead with briefers once a week or so, and has yet to name a replacement for Clapper.\n\nThat job could be tough to fill. Spicer’s insistence that there is no shake-up of the DNI position in the works sounded definitive, but Trump’s willingness to change directions at a moment’s notice, and the emergence of multiple power centers within the nascent administration make it difficult to know what his real plans are.\n\nOn top of that uncertainty, the new DNI would be responsible for riding herd on the 16 different agencies that make up the Intelligence Community, many of which are reportedly suffering serious morale problems in the wake of the incoming president’s attacks on them.\n\nHis top pick is reported to be retired Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, who until the end of the previous Congress served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but no formal announcement has yet been made.\n\nThe job may be less attractive today than it looked when Coats visited Trump Tower in Manhattan last November. Current DNI Clapper has taken to publicly mentioning how soon he will retire in his appearances before Congress and on Thursday, he didn’t disappoint. “Happily, I just have 15 days left,” he said."

    "text": "During meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence offered a preview of President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural address later this month.\n\nThere will be plenty of talk, Pence suggested, about repealing and replacing Obamacare and toughening immigration policies. Trump will promote his $1 trillion plan for new infrastructure, as well as trillions more in major tax cuts and beefing up the military.\n\nRelated: The GOP May Get a Taste of Its Own Medicine on Supreme Court Nominations\n\nBut Trump frequently said on the campaign trail that his three-part agenda could best be summed up as “Jobs, jobs jobs.”\n\nAnd a new survey by Morning Consult and Politico released yesterday suggests that on the issue of jobs and economic growth, Trump and the public are very much in sync. Asked what they want Trump to focus on most when he delivers his inaugural address on January 20, 75 percent of American voters said keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and bringing jobs back from overseas.\n\nWhat’s more, 52 percent said they want to hear the new president discuss his threats of slapping tariffs on imported goods made in China and Mexico.\n\nWhile many voters are eager for him to speak out on issues that dominated the campaign, including immigration reform, building a wall along the southern border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country, the nation also yearns to hear conciliatory rhetoric from the new 45th president of the United States.\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Plan to Slam the Brakes on Trump’s Cabinet\n\nSeventy-four percent of the 2,000 voters surveyed December 28 and 29 said they want to hear from Trump on the importance of healing the country after one of the dirtiest and most divisive presidential campaigns of modern times. A sizeable majority (62 percent) also said it was important for Trump to talk about his plans for selecting a new Supreme Court justice to succeed the late conservative jurist Antonin Scalia.\n\nVoters are also interested in hearing from Trump on several issues that he may not want to talk about.\n\nThose include the real estate mogul’s efforts to separate himself from his family business interests to avoid a conflict of interest, and revelations of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which Trump has repeatedly scoffed at. Fifty-three percent would like to hear about the hacking and 61 percent are keenly interested in the billionaire’s potential conflicts of interest.\n\nBut those voters interviewed were most interested in jobs, and presumably what Trump has in mind to fulfill his promises.\n\nSince winning the election November 8, Trump has focused on preserving or bolstering manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Through a series of tweets and off-handed comments, Trump has aggressively jawboned the auto industry and other manufacturers into keeping some jobs in this country or bringing them back from Mexico and overseas.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nThose efforts ranged from persuading an Indiana air conditioning and heating manufacturer to keep 800 jobs in the state that were slated for transfer to Mexico to badgering Ford Motor Co. to jettison plans this week to build a $1.6 billion small-car factory in Mexico.\n\nTrump is spoiling for more run-ins with U.S. corporations that operate overseas and import their products back here, or that are considering plans to move more jobs overseas. And he is promising hard-edged bargaining with China, Mexico and other trading partners to lower overseas obstacles to U.S. products by threatening retaliatory import duties and tariffs.\n\nTrump’s choice of attorney Robert Lighthizer as the U.S. Trade Representative, billionaire businessman Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary and economist Peter Navarro as the head of a new government trade council, will bring together three veteran trade experts who share Trump’s determination to shake up the international trade scene to the advantage of the U.S.\n\nHouse Republicans have drafted a border tax plan to discourage imports, according to The Wall Street Journal. Trump and his advisers have proposed a tax or tariff of 35 percent on goods produced by companies that shift production crews overseas."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/05/Why-Debt-Limit-Next-Threat-US-Economy",
    "text": "Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has probably seen his last debt limit fight as the man in charge of meeting the country’s financial obligations, but on his way out the door, he is calling on Congress to do away with the statutory ceiling on borrowing that has brought the US to the brink of default several times over the past few decades.\n\nIn a new article to be published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation, Lew argues that the system originally set up to facilitate the Treasury’s borrowing has transformed into “a broken, outdated system that no longer meets our country’s needs.”\n\nRelated: As the Debt Hits $20 Trillion, Has the US Reached a Tipping Point?\n\nCiting the multiple times since the 1990s when members of Congress have threatened actual default on the Treasury’s financial obligations -- moves that have led to increased borrowing costs, financial instability, and at one point a downgrade of the Treasury’s credit rating, he argues, “We must change course. If this were an external threat to our national security, we would bolster our national defense. If this were a foreseeable natural disaster, we would harden our infrastructure to mitigate that risk.”\n\nAs evidence, he cites the Government Accountability Office, which found that the debt limit fight in 2011 resulted in Treasury’s borrowing costs increasing by between $1 billion and $1.7 billion. Those costs, he noted, “are ultimately borne by the taxpayer because Treasury will be making higher interest payments, which ultimately must be funded through higher taxes.”\n\nThe repeated threats of default on the debt, he said, are also “a clear risk that could result in an unacceptable threat to the health of our financial system.” Countless investors around the world rely on US Treasury securities as an effectively risk-free asset. Treasury holdings undergird mutual funds, retirement plans, and the holdings of banks and insurance firms. Certainty about their safety and value not only keeps borrowing costs low but provides assurance about the safety and soundness of the financial system as a whole.\n\nIn Congress, battles over the debt limit are frequently cast as a fight against government spending. But, as Lew points out when the time comes to borrow money to pay federal obligations, the question of how much money the government is going to spend has already been settled, by Congress itself.\n\nRelated: Trump Picks a Leading Deficit Hawk to Run the White House Budget Office\n\n“[W]hen the bills for expenditures already authorized by Congress come due, they must be paid, and these bills are not an abstraction; they are the salaries of our troops, benefits for our veterans and retirees, and payments to hospitals for providing care, not to mention turning on the lights for the federal government,” Lew writes.\n\nHe adds, “Raising the debt limit does not authorize any federal spending; it simply allows the government to pay bills already incurred.”\n\nBottom line, Lew argues, the utter politicization of the debt limit is a threat to the safety of the United States: “What once was a deadline that drove debates on the budget has transformed into a nihilistic platform for some in Congress to promote the very real risk of a default to advance narrow partisan agendas.”\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nEven using all of the methods at its disposal, he said, constant fights about the debt limit expose the system to “needless risks that Treasury cannot meaningfully mitigate.”\n\nWhile it remains unlikely that members of Congress can be persuaded to put down what has become an extremely powerful weapon in policy battles, Lew at least offers his successors at Treasury a coherent argument that, for the good of the country, they should."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/01/05/Seven-Tests-Can-Keep-Republicans-Screwing",
    "text": "It didn’t take long for Republicans to make their first tin-eared mistake after winning a broad victory in November. In fact, they had barely opened the new session of Congress before performing a pratfall that called into question whether they learned anything from the populist revolt that struck both parties over the past two years.\n\nOn Monday night, House Republicans met to consider their top priorities for the 115th Session of Congress, after an election in which voters made clear their displeasure with the Washington DC establishment and the status quo. Instead of focusing on moves to improve accountability within the Beltway, they instead put their efforts into limiting the independence of the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nRelated: GOP House, Off to a Shaky Start, Backtracks on Killing Ethics Panel\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have complained about alleged abuses from OCE, and there may well be defensible changes to reduce the potential for future reforms. However, as Paul Ryan reportedly warned the caucus, this self-interested focus was hardly what voters expected of the new Congress, and it didn’t take long for Ryan to be proven prescient. The media gleefully reported that House Republicans had “gutted” ethics accountability, and even Donald Trump tweeted out his disapproval. Less than 24 hours after their vote to change the House rules on OCE, the GOP caucus reversed course and threw in the towel.\n\nThe Washington Post headlined this as “a day of chaos.” It certainly wasn’t a propitious start to the ambitious session planned by president-elect Trump and Republican leadership. The fumble left the impression that many Republicans still thought voters would accept business as usual, and perhaps even assumed that their lopsided victory at all levels in November signaled a specific embrace of the Republican Party and carte blanche to act on the agenda of its politicians.\n\nThat would be a dangerous assumption. Voters did not suddenly embrace Republicans as much as they rejected Democrats, with the GOP benefiting from the binary political system. Democrats made a similar assumption after winning sweeping victories in the 2006 and 2008 elections, and have paid for it ever since. Democrats failed to understand that and spent the last six years reducing their party to its worst political position since the 1920s, and possibly since Reconstruction.\n\nRelated: The Republican War on Obama’s Regulations Is About to Begin\n\nVoters did not elect Republicans as much as they elected for a change – and want it to result in positive action, economic revival, a secure and strong America, and most of all greater accountability from Washington DC. Had they articulated among themselves a set of tests for proposed actions that reflected those principles, they might have avoided this debacle entirely. These seven tests, in descending priority order, will provide Republicans on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue insight into whether their actions reflect their understanding of that mandate:\n\nDoes it serve to bring accountability to the political establishment in Washington DC? – No other value mattered more to voters in both parties in this cycle. Donald Trump ran explicitly on a promise to “drain the swamp,” a promise he has reaffirmed after his election. Had Republicans internalized this properly, they never would have dared to make OCE changes as their Day One action item. Does it add to the economic power of the US and create good jobs for Americans? – Populists on the Left cared more about attacking corporate and individual wealth, but on the Right, the main driver was economic stagnation outside of the coastal enclaves and Washington DC. Twenty-five years ago, James Carville said, “It’s the economy, stupid,” but now it’s the making sure the economy produces winners across the board. That may matter most in trade agreements, but the expected regulatory and tax reforms have to take this into account as well.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Is a Fiscal Minefield for the GOP\n\n\n\nDoes it address the most critical needs of the country ahead of the ideological agendas of the parties? – Voters increasingly see Republicans and Democrats in Washington as a separate species, not as members of their communities. They want the government to fix what’s truly broken and stay out of what’s not. Voters expect politicians to find solutions rather than conduct the same endless debates we have had for decades. Delivering practical solutions that benefit their communities will go a long way in establishing credibility.\n\n\n\nDoes it enhance national security and the defense of Americans both at home and abroad? - Voters demand both liberty and security as part of making America great again. They want national security tailored to our needs rather than those of other nations, or a very good explanation of why the latter falls within our national interest.\n\nDoes it serve the rule of law equally applied to all? – Perhaps no more corrosive belief to well-functioning self-governance exists than the assumption that power and privilege result in favorable treatment from the government. That manifests itself in many ways – law enforcement as well as regulatory and tax policy, but also in accountability. Restoring confidence in the system requires a renewed commitment to the rule of law rather than the rule of whim or cronyism. The failure to adhere to this principle is a key factor in the rise of populism.\n\nRelated: The GOP May Get a Taste of Its Own Medicine on Supreme Court Nominations\n\n\n\nDoes it restore the proper balance of power between the executive and legislative branches? – Braggadocio about pens and phones might have proven satisfactory for the outgoing president, but the legislature is the most accountable branch of government to voters. Regulatory reform must account for a massive shift in power to executive agencies when it comes to rule-setting and law enforcement over the last several decades, much of which leaves Americans at the whim of bureaucrats without due process to protect them. Congress needs to exert control over the bureaucracy as part of reducing regulation as an end in itself.\n\n\n\nDoes it restore the proper balance of power between Washington DC and the states? – Voters feel disconnected from self-governance because the government has increasingly become disconnected from them. A renewed push for federalism and subsidiarity will allow voters more control over policies in their own communities and states, while at the same time reducing the opportunities for cronyism and corruption in Washington DC. Republicans promised this the last time they had single-party control in the Beltway, and instead delivered the K Street Project and more federal programs that crowded out local and state initiatives. They can ill afford another failure.\n\nRepublicans don’t have a great deal of time to prove to voters that they have learned this lesson. Both the Trump administration and the GOP on Capitol Hill need to earn their credibility by adhering to the principles on which voters put their trust in them. If Republicans fail to learn from the Democrats’ failures in 2010 forward, and especially their own failures in 2006 and 2008, voters will turn on them just as quickly."

    "text": "Under the incoming Donald Trump administration, nominations to the Supreme Court could wind up being even more of a political flashpoint than they have been in recent years, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday night said that he would “absolutely” do his best to keep the current vacancy on the court unfilled.\n\nThe comments came after the New York senator had previously suggested that Democrats would be willing to support a Trump nominee if he or she were “mainstream.” In an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, he clarified that he doesn’t expect that condition to be met.\n\nRelated: GOP House, Off to a Shaky Start, Backtracks on Killing Ethics Panel\n\n“My worry is, with the hard right running the show, that the likelihood of the nominee being mainstream is decreasing every day,” he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday reacted with indignation to the idea of an indefinite delay on filling the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia early last year.\n\n“That is something the American people will not tolerate,” he said in a Capitol Hill press conference, “and we’ll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it.”\n\nThe irony of McConnell criticizing an extended hold on filling a Supreme Court slot was lost on nobody. The Kentucky Republican was the chief architect of a successful plan to prevent President Obama from filling Scalia’s seat over the final year of his presidency.\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Plan to Slam the Brakes on Trump’s Cabinet\n\nTo do so, McConnell relied on a comment that Vice President Biden made in 1992 about perhaps not filling a non-existent vacancy during the final months of President George H.W. Bush’s term. McConnell and his colleagues inflated the comment into the “Biden Rule” and pretended that it had been the actual policy of the Democratic Party in order to justify blocking the nomination of an appointee, Federal Judge Merrick Garland, who members of both parties had said was eminently qualified.\n\nIn criticizing Schumer’s suggestion that Democrats could hold the Scalia seat open during Trump’s term, McConnell also failed to note that just days before the presidential election, members of his own party were suggesting that if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were to win, they would do exactly that.\n\n“There is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices,” said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, discussing the prospect of refusing to seat Clinton’s Supreme Court nominees. “I would note, just recently, that Justice [Stephen] Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job. That’s a debate that we are going to have.”\n\nAt around the same time, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr reportedly said in a private gathering, “[I]f Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.”\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nWhether or not Schumer will follow through with a threat to block a Trump nominee is unclear. The Democrats are facing a tough slate of senate elections in 2018, with several incumbents running in states that Trump won in the presidential election. Convincing enough Democrats to uphold an indefinite filibuster of a Trump nominee could be too heavy a lift.\n\nAnd even if Democrats are able to hold the line, they have already provided Republicans with a roadmap for getting around it. When former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the “nuclear option” in 2014, doing away with the filibuster for presidential nominees other than Supreme Court justices, the decision to leave the high court out of it was optional. McConnell could easily invoke the same process to eliminate Supreme Court nominee filibusters.\n\nDemocrats could take their revenge by adopting McConnell’s strategy of total opposition to all Republican legislation, which he employed to great effect while serving as senate minority leader. The result would be either total gridlock in the legislative branch, or further expansion of the nuclear option to cover legislation as well as nomination, eliminating the minority party from lawmaking entirely.\n\nIn either case, the only sure outcome would be that public approval of Congress, already at historic lows, would continue its seemingly inevitable slide toward zero."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/04/Obamacare-Repeal-Fiscal-Minefield-GOP",
    "text": "Congressional Republicans have begun the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which will not only force them to come up with a plan to replace the program, but as an analysis released by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget demonstrates, to fill a hole in the federal budget of as much as $350 billion through 2027.\n\nThe massive health care law is a combination of mandates, taxes, regulations and undoing it wholesale would involve not just repealing the things that cost the government money, like premium subsidies, but also measures that save money, like restrictions put in place to slow the growth of health care spending.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Will Test the Definition of ‘Insurance’\n\nThe CRFB’s $350 billion figure (potentially only $150 billion under a dynamic scoring model) is most properly seen not as a guaranteed shortfall so much as a baseline. Republicans, as much as they detest Obamacare, have repeatedly said that the plan is not to repeal it and walk away, but to engineer a replacement that delivers health insurance coverage to the same number of people at a lower cost, with fewer requirements on individuals and businesses.\n\nHow they will do that remains a large and still unanswered question, and the CRFB analysis provides a useful breakdown of some of the challenges that the GOP will face in both repealing the ACA and keeping their promises about a replacement.\n\nThe biggest money-saver would be a full-on repeal of the law’s coverage provisions, CRFB finds. “Of the $1.55 trillion in savings from repealing the ACA’s coverage provisions, $900 billion comes from repealing insurance and cost-sharing subsidies and $1.10 trillion from repealing the Medicaid expansion. These savings are partially offset by $250 billion of cost from repealing the legislation’s insurance mandate penalties and another $200 billion from interactions and various other provisions.”\n\nHowever, that would also result in about 23 million people losing their insurance -- something Republicans have repeatedly promised not to allow.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nThose savings, though, would be offset by repealing the law’s revenue provisions.\n\n“About half of the $800 billion of revenue loss from repealing ACA’s taxes comes from removing the 0.9 percent Medicare payroll surtax on wages above $200,000 ($150 billion) and the 3.8 percent surtax on investment income above the same threshold ($250 billion). Another quarter of the revenue loss comes from repealing various fees on insurance companies, medical device companies, and drug manufacturers.\n\n“Repealing the “Cadillac tax” on high-cost insurance plans costs $100 billion over a decade; those costs are slated to grow substantially over time, and repealing the Cadillac tax without a replacement would also remove a key tool in helping to slow overall health care cost growth.”\n\nFinally, CRFB notes, total repeal of Obamacare would entail getting rid of numerous measures that have successfully slowed the rate of growth in healthcare spending, and which are expected to save $1.1 trillion between now and 2027.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nAlso possible, though, are various versions of a partial repeal of the ACA, leaving in place certain elements of the law and eliminating others. This would, in theory, break the GOP’s promise of total repeal, but under some circumstance would give lawmakers enough financial running room to at least make a credible attempt at a replacement.\n\nFor example, CRFB reports, if all the existing coverage provisions were repealed, but the revenue and cost-saving measures were kept in place, there would be $1.55 trillion (or $1.75 trillion on a dynamic scoring basis) available to fund a replacement to cover the 23 million people expected to lose coverage under the original legislation.\n\nIn the end, none of these things will happen in a vacuum. The GOP can’t simply flip a switch and turn off programs that have been baked into the nation’s healthcare infrastructure over the course of years, and many of these programs will likely be phased out over time. But the report offers a good bird’s-eye view of the scope of the challenge Republican lawmakers have set for themselves."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/04/3-GOP-Senators-Who-Could-Stop-Obamacare-Repeal",
    "text": "President Obama and GOP Vice president-elect Mike Pence staged dueling appearances on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning with two very different missions:\n\nWith less than three weeks left in his administration, Obama sought to rally the Democrats to try to salvage key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, Pence sought to stiffen the Republican majority’s resolve to repeal a national health insurance program that has extended coverage to more than 20 million Americans.\n\nRelated: Republicans Take the First Step to Repeal Obamacare\n\nThe Republicans, for sure, are holding most of the high cards in this critically important political poker game, with GOP majorities in the House and the Senate and President-elect Donald Trump, an arch foe of Obamacare, about to succeed Obama in the White House. And the Senate wasted little time yesterday, during the opening day of the new Congress, in unveiling a skeletal budget bill that will be used as the vehicle for dismantling much of Obamacare in the coming weeks.\n\nBut as the Republicans appear on the verge of realizing a six-year-old goal of repealing one of Obama’s crowning achievements, the enormity of their action is sinking in. And at least a few GOP lawmakers are having second thoughts about the wisdom of repealing the Affordable Care Act before having a suitable replacement in hand.\n\nEven without Republican opposition, Obamacare has had challenges from the outset. The millions of dollars spent on Healthcare.gov that took more than a year to function properly was the first blow. The second was Obama’s broken promises: You can keep your doctor and your health plan, neither of which was true.\n\nBut the greatest setback was the lack of signups by young people who were supposed to pay for the chronically ill and aged. That led to higher premiums and outrageously high deductibles for people who in some cases could not afford to go to a doctor even if their premiums were subsidized. Without the young people buttressing the old, insurers lost money, and some decided to bail out of the program altogether.\n\nFor consumers who depended on Aetna and United, this was yet another nightmare. But through it all, 20 million people had access to healthcare – many for the first time in their lives.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nTrump, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Rep Tom Price (R-GA), Trump’s designated health and human services secretary and others bravely insist the key elements of a market-oriented GOP replacement plan are on the drawing board. Yet with many Americans just waking up to the fact they could lose their Obamacare or expanded Medicaid coverage and a growing uproar among insurers, hospital administrators, doctors and consumer advocates worried about the consequences of the GOP’s planned actions, some Republicans are raising a cautionary flag.\n\nAt least three Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana – have signaled to their leaders that it would be a big mistake to plunge ahead with repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan waiting in the wings, as the Morning Consult reported today.\n\nObamacare provides tax subsidies to low and moderate income families and individuals to purchase private health insurance on government-run exchanges. It also requires uninsured Americans to purchase coverage, imposes other mandates on insurers, the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals and the medical device industry, and it levies taxes to help finance operating costs.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Will Test the Definition of ‘Insurance’\n\nBecause of the special budget “reconciliation” rules being followed to sidestep Democratic opposition, the Republicans can repeal some but not all of Obamacare. Moreover, Trump has said he wants to preserve some provisions of the current law, including a ban on insurers discriminating against consumers who have chronic illnesses and allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nThe three GOP senators cited concerns about adverse market reaction to a swift, partial repeal of Obamacare without an alternative to replace it. Even if the repeal doesn’t formally take effect for two or three years, the lawmakers worry about a continued exodus of major insurance companies from Obamacare and rising premiums during the transition.\n\nCassidy on Tuesday tweeted that “Many are worried about losing insurance coverage.” Collins told the Portland Press Herald late last month that she didn’t “want to see people drop through the cracks.” And on Monday, Paul warned in an op-ed in Rare that unless they moved quickly to replace Obamacare with a fully-developed plan that works, the Republicans could end up being blamed for the continued deterioration of the program.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions\n\n“We should repeal Obamacare, but partial repeal will only accelerate the current chaos and may eventually lead to calls for a taxpayer bailout of insurance companies,” he wrote.\n\nPaul added, “Partial repeal of Obamacare will likely win the day, but when the insurance companies come to Washington crying for a bailout don’t say that no one warned of this preventable disaster.”\n\nAlthough none of the three Republicans are threatening to vote against a repeal budget package, they all sit on committees that will work directly on the repeal effort and the subsequent replacement legislation. What’s more, with Republicans holding a relatively narrow 52 to 48 seat majority in the Senate, it would only take three defections to stop the repeal effort in its tracks.\n\nA number of studies by the Congressional Budget Office and independent research organizations have warned that a partial repeal of Obamacare would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance and Medicaid coverage or having to settle for considerably less coverage.\n\nRelated: 3 Years to Replace Obamacare? Republicans Are Wading Into a Quagmire\n\nDuring a press conference after meeting with House Republicans, Pence repeatedly sought to assure lawmakers that the incoming Trump administration would do nothing to “work a hardship” on the American people.\n\n“We’re talking about people’s lives, we’re talking about families,” Pence said. “But we are also talking about a policy [under Obama] that has been a failure virtually since its inception.”\n\n“We intend over the course of the coming days and weeks to be speaking directly to the American people about that failure, but about a better future we can have in healthcare,” he added. “A future that is built not on growing government, not on mandates, not on taxes, but rather a future that is built on giving the American people more choices in health care, allowing the power of the free marketplace to flow in.”\n\nBut following the Democrats closed-door meeting with Obama, newly ensconced Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York mocked Trump and the Republican leadership, arguing that they are trapped in their commitment to repeal Obamacare, but with no consensus on how to replace it.\n\n“My Republican colleagues don’t quite know what to do,” Schumer told reporters. “They’re like the dog who caught the bus. They can repeal, but they have nothing to put in its place. And that means so many good things go away.”"

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump appears to have bought into the idea that there is a conspiracy within the entire United States Intelligence Community to blame the Russian government for cyberattacks that compromised the Democratic National Committee and senior figures in the party in the run up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAfter months of casting doubt about the consensus finding of intelligence agencies that the hacks, and the dissemination of files and emails, was orchestrated by Moscow, Trump on Tuesday night used Twitter to suggest that intelligence officers had been forced to delay a briefing on the hacking because of a lack of evidence.\n\nRelated: Trump and the GOP Are On a Collision Course over Russian Sanctions\n\nThe \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017\n\nAdministration officials told news organizations that they were mystified by the President-elect’s suggestion that the intelligence agencies had delayed the briefing, saying that it had always been scheduled for Friday.\n\nTrump followed up on Wednesday morning with another tweet referring to a televised interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that aired Tuesday night. Assange, whose organization released thousands of hacked emails from the DNC and from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, spoke to Fox News personality Sean Hannity, an unabashed cheerleader for Trump throughout the presidential campaign.\n\nDuring the interview, Assange repeated his denial that WikiLeaks received the hacked information from the Russian government and claimed that Podesta had fallen for a hacking method so rudimentary a child could have used it.\n\nJulian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nAssange also criticized a preliminary report into the hacking issued by U.S. intelligence agencies as “either a deliberate attempt to mislead or thoroughly incompetent work.”\n\nTrump’s criticism of U.S. intelligence agencies is not new. Since last summer, when the Intelligence Community released a statement saying that they believed the hacking attacks on Democrats were orchestrated by Russia with an aim to disrupt the presidential election, he has defended Russia, claiming that there is no evidence of the Kremlin’s involvement.\n\nTrump’s apparent decision to side with Assange against the U.S. Intelligence Community suggests that his already strained relationship with those agencies is not going to improve any time soon.\n\nIn an interview with PBS, conducted before Trump’s latest suggestion that his agency is trying to hoodwink the public, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan said that a comprehensive assessment of the intelligence agencies’ findings with regard to the hacking is nearing completion and will be delivered to President Obama and President-elect Trump later this week.\n\nHe defended the work of his colleagues against Trump’s criticism of past failures and said, “There is no intelligence community worldwide that has the capabilities, the expertise, the analytic capability as the U.S. intelligence community. And so I would suggest to individuals who have not yet seen the report, who have not yet been briefed on it that they wait and see what it is that the intelligence community is putting forward before they make those judgments.”\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nBrennan also took a swipe at Assange, saying that the WikiLeaks founder, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for five years fighting extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges (which he adamantly denies) is “not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.”\n\nBrennan continued, “And so, therefore, I wouldn’t ascribe to any of these individual making comments that it is providing the whole, unvarnished truth. Again, this report is going to include what it is that we know about what happened, what was collected, what was disclosed, and what the purpose and intent of that effort was.”"

    "text": "While President Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act looms as the Republicans’ biggest target in the new Congress, conservatives in the House and Senate are poised to roll back hundreds of administration regulations and rules in the coming weeks. They range from environmental and workplace protections to off-shore drilling, financial industry reforms, and energy-saving mandates.\n\nGOP Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have bitterly complained for years about executive overreach by Obama and his agency heads – arguing that they have unnecessarily hamstrung businesses, industries and consumers and added billions of dollars to the cost of doing business.\n\nRelated: 3 Years to Replace Obamacare? Republicans Are Wading Into a Quagmire\n\nNow, with Republicans in firm control of Congress and GOP President-elect Donald Trump preparing to succeed Obama in the White House Jan. 20, conservative lawmakers have an open field to demolish many of the most controversial Obama-era regulations that were implemented dating back to early June.\n\n“These last eight years, we have seen a disturbing trend of the federal government unnecessarily inserting themselves more and more into the lives of hardworking Americans – and the results have been economically disastrous,” Rep. Meadows (R-NC), chair of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\n“When the American people spoke on Nov. 8, they provided conservatives with an opportunity to restore order in our government and to remove the out-of-control bureaucratic red tape that so often stunts the growth of otherwise successful Americans,” Meadows added.\n\nFrom the perspective of conservative lawmakers in the Freedom Caucus, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, small business owners, mining companies, utilities and the financial industry, many of Obama’s cherished regulatory actions are prime for the plucking.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nFor instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) last September issued a major revamping of nursing home rules to improve the quality of service and bar operators from compelling residents to settle disputes in arbitration as a condition of admission. The nursing home industry has fought the 713-page rule.\n\nThen in late December, the Obama administration unveiled a major new environmental regulation for the coal industry that would restrict the use of highly destructive mountaintop-removal mining – another measure that the coal mining industry and its allies on Capitol Hill insist will kill jobs and further harm the economy.\n\nCongress is likely to block or roll back those and scores of other regulations by using a little-known piece of legislation called the Congressional Review Act, which was authored by a conservative Indiana House member and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nThe rarely used law allows Congress to cast simple majority votes of disapproval of regulations implemented by the executive branch within 60 legislative days of action in order for Congress to reclaim some of its policymaking authority – but without becoming a super regulatory body.\n\nRelated: GOP Cuts in Medicare May Be Next After Dismantling Obamacare\n\nBetween 1996 and August 2011, agencies have submitted 1,029 major rules and 56,000 minor regulations to Congress for review. Throughout that period, 72 Congressional Review Act resolutions of disapproval targeting 49 major rules were introduced, according to the Congressional Research Service. Of those, only three passed both chambers of Congress, and only one was enacted – a Department of Labor ergonomics regulation during the Clinton administration.\n\nSince 2011, when the Republicans were back in control of the House, Congress has adopted a number of resolutions of disapproval, but all have been vetoed by Obama.\n\nNow that the Republicans will have control of the House and Senate and the White House, it will be far easier to get a resolution of disapproval enacted.\n\nWriting recently for the Heritage Foundation, analysts Daren Bakst and James L. Gattuso said that the “stars are aligned” for the CRA and congressional Republicans to push for action against what they view as the most onerous Obama regulations. A Congressional Research Service memo released in November concluded that 220 regulations submitted to Congress after May 30, 2016, would be subject to review under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nRelated: Obamacare RIP—Republicans Finally Have a Plan\n\nOne problem for the Republicans is that the CRA would only allow them to roll back one Obama regulation at a time, a legislative piecemeal approach rather than rolling dozens of targeted regulations into one resolution and passing it. In an effort to address that problem, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) introduced the “Midnight Rules Relief Act) on Tuesday that would allow Congress to address multiple regulations at one time.\n\nAlthough House and Senate leaders haven’t agreed among themselves on which Obama regulations to attack, here are a dozen or so that the Freedom Caucus and Senate GOP leaders have floated in recent weeks:\n\nLabor regulations: A Department of Labor overtime rule that more than doubles – from $23,660 to $47,476 – the annual threshold under which workers generally qualify for time and a half pay when working more than 40 hours in a week. The rule is currently being challenged in courts by the business community and advocates.\n\nDepartment of Labor rules implementing Obama’s 2014 Fair Pay & Safe Workplace executive order. The rules require that federal contractors report violations of 14 different federal and state labor laws to the federal government. Critics say it is too intrusive.\n\nFinancial Industry: Major changes in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial industry reforms, including neutralizing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB, created as part of the overall law, has long been a target for lawmakers championing banks. Its future has been called into question after a federal appeals court ruling that the bureau’s leadership structure is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Treasury Department finalized rules that would “re-characterize” some debt as equity. This would have the effect of raising taxes since businesses often loan money to each other and can deduct interest payments on these loans.\n\nWithin the telecommunications field, conservatives want to do away with the FCC’s 2015 “net neutrality” rule that prohibits internet service providers from actively blocking, favoring or slowing down access to any particular online content.\n\nThe Environment and Energy production: The U.S. Department of the Interior released the final Stream Protection Rule, which aims to protect streams from the impacts of surface, long-wall and mountaintop removal mining. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others vowed to lead a fight against the new regulations.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management issued a final rule regarding methane emissions from venting and flaring during oil and natural gas production on federal and Indian land. The EPA separately published a final rule regarding methane emissions. Critics say these rules will hurt American oil and gas-related jobs.\n\nThe Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue issued a final rule regarding the valuation of coal produced on federal and Indian land and oil and natural gas produced on federal land and waters. The rule changes the way royalties are calculated when companies sell the fossil fuels they remove from federal land and is opposed by industry.\n\nThe Energy Department has finalized six of 14 energy efficiency rules it announced it would issue this year as part of its broader climate policy, including new efficiency standards for ceiling fans, dehumidifiers and battery chargers. Opponents say the rule increase the price of energy-powered products and reduce manufacturing jobs.\n\nEducation: The Department of Education issued final regulations altering the accountability measures for K-12 schools that critics says are too prescriptive and conflict with congressional intent.\n\nThe Department of Education issued final rules for teacher preparation programs requiring federal standards for evaluating these programs – based significantly on test scores. Critics say the rule conflicts with the flexibility Congress provided in the recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\nHealth care: The Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of proposed rule-making in September that could prevent states from blocking Title X funding to Planned Parenthood, which would provide tax dollars for family planning services. Republicans who oppose this measure fear that it will be finalized before January 20 when Trump is inaugurated.\n\nRestrictions on the tobacco industry. While this idea lacks clarity, many Freedom Caucus members want the Food and Drug Administration to ease regulations on cigarette and cigar manufacturers."

Maybe Americans have been emboldened by the British who ignored warnings that voting for Brexit would rain chaos and misery upon England only to find that leaving the EU might not be so painful after all.\n\nA headline in yesterday’s Financial Times said it all: “Economists’ outlook after Brexit dims despite lack of clear damage to economy.” No clear damage, but they’re just sure Brexit cannot be positive.\n\nHere’s what the elites fail to understand: millions of Americans (just like the Brits) are worried about the country’s future. No matter how often Obama explained the wonders of Obamacare, or the Iran nuclear deal, or the importance of his global climate accord, sensible Americans remained unconvinced.\n\nThey wanted a new leader with new ideas about how to put people back to work and bolster incomes. They now have that leader, and so far he has given them what he promised – an end to the status quo. He has made cabinet picks that are accomplished and unconventional and who appear committed to turning things around, and he has taken an outside-the-box approach to many of our nation’s challenges.\n\nRelated: Trump Steps Up Effort to Discredit Sanctions Against Russia\n\nAmericans hope that Trump’s controversial programs might give the country the boost it needs. Here is an important fact that Trump understands and that Obama does not: the kind of optimism he is generating can all by itself usher in a rosier economy. In fact, it is already doing so.\n\nBack in 2009, just as he took office, Obama went out of his way to trash talk the economy. At a time when investors and consumers needed reassurance, Obama predicted “trillion dollar deficits for years to come” and portrayed the economy as hanging by a thread. He was correct that the country was struggling, but his gloomy pronouncements, which more than once triggered market sell-offs, made matters worse.\n\nThough the economy turned around slowly, Obama never stopped reminding Americans of all that was wrong with the U.S. – our racism and intolerance, our greed and undue attention to profits, our predilection for thinking we were special. Not for him was Reagan’s optimism.\n\nTrump’s optimism is not the kindly sunshine of Ronald Reagan, but a blustery, combative can-do positivity that is a welcome change from the uber-intellectual detachment of the Obama White House. Just as the billionaire developer was famous for convincing reluctant financiers that his next deal was going to be the biggest, the best, the most fabulous ever – and that they would rue the day they turned down his loan -- Trump has sold Americans on the promise that he can create jobs.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nThe Left says he lies all the time; mostly, he just exaggerates. Americans understand the difference, and for the moment, they are giving him the benefit of the doubt and hoping that even a fraction of what he promises will come true. They are upbeat, and that sentiment is carrying Trump forward to Inauguration Day with a wind at his back.\n\nThat won’t stop the incessant torrent of criticism and skepticism from the mainstream media. Democrats and the liberal media will spend 2017 trying to scare the bejesus out of Americans, warning, especially, that GOP efforts to streamline our government and cut down on duplicative and excess rules will undermine health and safety. They will portray any loosening of the regulatory knot as “prioritizing billionaires and big corporations” as Senator Patty Murray recently put it – a threat that any self-respecting Democrat should oppose.\n\nMillions know this is pure baloney – that the nightmarish layers upon layers of rules imposed on businesses have crushed our entrepreneurs and deadened our animal spirits. This is not fantasy; the numbers prove it out. Sluggish business investment has been a drag on the recovery for years.\n\nFor 2015 overall, business spending rose only 2.8 percent. And 2016 saw further retrenchment. Only the Ivory Tower set- people who have never created a job or built a business – dismiss the critical need for regulatory overhaul.\n\nObama has paid lip service to the negative impact of regulatory overload – even as he has gone about spinning them out at a record clip.\n\nTrump promises more than lip service, and his pledge to help businesses has already boosted morale. In the two weeks after the election, the NFIB index of small business optimism recorded its sharpest surge since 2009. For those managers following the presidential race, expectations that business conditions would improve jumped from -6 to a hefty +38.\n\nIf those folks put their money where their optimism is, Trump will be well on his way to producing the kind of economic acceleration he has promised. But don’t expect Democrats to applaud."

By contrast, at least seven in ten Americans had confidence in Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton before each of them took office.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nIn the run-up to his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has repeatedly rattled China’s cage with sharp criticism of its trade and geopolitical policies, and his phone conversation with the Taiwan president disrupted decades of diplomatic protocol barring such communications.\n\nTrump has virtually sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin against the U.S. intelligence community by questioning whether Russian hackers meddled in the U.S. election. He declared that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” all but inviting a renewal of the nuclear arms race.\n\nAnd faced with the threat from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that his rogue nation might soon test an intercontinental ballistic missile that potentially could reach the United States, Trump flatly declared “It won’t happen” in a tweet on Monday, without providing a sense of what the diplomatic or military consequences for North Korea might be.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nTrump has refused to relinquish his Twitter account since his surprise victory in November, despite mounting criticism from Democrats, public policy experts and others that it is a highly imprecise and reckless way to set policy and interact with foreign leaders. This is especially true since his national security, defense and foreign affairs team is still a work in progress and many of this top nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\nBruce Klingner, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow and specialist on North and South Korea, said in an interview on Tuesday that “I would hope once Mr. Trump becomes president he’ll stop using a Twitter account to send signals about U.S. policy.”\n\n“Statements during the campaign as well as subsequent post-election tweets have generated questions and concerns amongst our allies, because they raise questions of what U.S. policy will be under Mr. Trump,” said Klingner, a one-time CIA deputy division chief. “Things that raise questions about U.S. commitment or resolve to support our allies, or conversely, suggestions of military action are catching allies by surprise.”\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a ‘Coup d’Etat’\n\n“And while unpredictability may be good in business negotiations, it’s less than optimal for alliance management,” he added. “Every word, every nuance issued by a U.S. president is parsed and analyzed and over-analyzed for suggestions of any policy change … And Twitter, with its 140-character limit, is extremely constrained in conveying nuance.”\n\nMichael O’Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy expert with the Brookings Institution, agrees with Klingner that Twitter is not a good tool for diplomacy.\n\n“The reason is NOT for its lack of politesse,” O’Hanlon said in an email. “The Chinese don’t deserve polite words on the subject of North Korea and certainly North Korea’s leadership deserves no soft words. However, once Trump fails to stop the ICBM launch (as he will, even if he decides to shoot it down after launch), his words will have rung hollow, and that will weaken him and hurt his credibility.”\n\nRelated: Was Trump’s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\n“So for the good of his own reputation and that of the US, he shouldn’t promise to stop things that he may well fail to prevent,” O’Hanlon added.\n\nTrump followed his warning to Kim with another potshot at China, North Korea’s main patron and trading partner. Trump complained that while China “has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth” from the U.S., it “won’t help with North Korea” in tamping down Kim’s fast expanding nuclear program. “Nice!” Trump added sarcastically.\n\nChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017\n\nSome experts agree with Trump that China could have brought more pressure on North Korea to rein in its nuclear program, although that carried risks of retaliation or heightened tensions between China and its neighbor. The United States and South Korea have responded to North Korean nuclear and missile tests with escalating economic sanctions.\n\nLast month, the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea designed to cut its annual export revenue by a quarter, after Pyongyang carried out is fifth and largest nuclear test in September. China went along with the sanctions, but complained that the United States and its ally South Korea were intensifying confrontation with North Korea through military exercises.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nIn response to Trump’s latest tweets, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that China had been pressing for the “denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula, according to media reports. \"China's efforts in this regard are perfectly obvious,\" Geng told reporters.\n\nTrump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked on ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday what Trump intended to do to stop North Korea's nuclear expansion. \"He's not stated that publicly, and he won't before he's inaugurated,\" Conway said. \"But we do know that there are sanctions that are possible … They have not always worked. I think China would have to have a significant role here as well.”"

    "text": "Many of President-elect Trump’s top-level cabinet appointments Donald Trump make the future direction of public policy in some areas less clear. His nominee for Defense Secretary has openly contradicted Trump’s claims about the efficacy of torture for extracting information from suspected terrorists. His nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services has advocated a massive overhaul of Medicare, a program Trump has vowed not to touch.\n\nBut on trade policy, Trump’s appointments have been consistent with his repeated promises to push hard against China and other nations that sell their goods into the United States. That continued Tuesday morning, with the announcement that Robert Lighthizer has been named the Trump administration’s U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nLighthizer, who served as a deputy United States Trade Representative during the Reagan administration, has been chair of the international trade law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom for more than 30 years.\n\nIn that capacity, he has represented U.S. firms in suits alleging unfair trade practices by foreign firms. According to the Trump transition team, “He has worked on scores of successful cases that resulted in reducing unfair imports and helping thousands of American workers and numerous businesses.”\n\nTrump touted Lighthizer’s dealmaking skills in announcing the appointment, saying, “Ambassador Lighthizer is going to do an outstanding job representing the United States as we fight for good trade deals that put the American worker first. He has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.”\n\nLighthizer joins a team that has already signaled that Trump’s promise to get confrontational on international trade issues was not an idle one.\n\nRelated: Conservative Economists Mock Trump Campaign’s Trade Proposals\n\nLast month, Trump named university of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro to head the newly created White House National Trade Council. A noted trade hawk, Navarro has been highly critical of China over the years, authoring a book in 2011 called Death by China: One Job at a Time. When it was turned into a movie, as though the title wasn’t clear enough, it was advertised with a poster showing a knife inscribed “Made in China” plunged into a flag-draped United States of America with blood pouring out of it.\n\nThe third leg of the Trump trade stool is venture capital billionaire Wilbur Ross, who Trump tapped to head the Commerce Department. Ross, an adviser to Trump during the presidential campaign, has a long history of doing business with and even praising China. However, during the campaign, he locked arms with Trump and Navarro, co-authoring op-eds and white papers with the economist that counseled strong protectionist trade policies.\n\n“It is a very high honor to represent our nation and to serve in President-elect Trump’s administration as the U.S. Trade Representative,” said Lighthizer in a statement. “I am fully committed to President-elect Trump’s mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies, which will benefit all Americans.”"

    "text": "Things are not off to the most auspicious start for the 115th Congress, which was gaveled into session late Tuesday morning. Facing massive public blowback, including criticism from their own party’s incoming President, Republicans in the House of Representatives have backed down from their plan to eliminate an independent ethics watchdog in one of their first acts of the new Congress.\n\nThe original plan, to strip the Office of Congressional Ethics of much of its independence and of its ability to make its findings public, was passed in a secret vote Monday night, against the wishes of senior leaders in the Republican conference, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. It was to be part of a new package of rules for the operation of the House during the new session.\n\nRelated: House GOP Votes to ‘Strengthen’ Ethics Watchdog...by Gutting It\n\nThe very public retreat from the proposal can be seen one of two ways—or both. It could serve as confirmation that in the 115th Congress, GOP leaders will continue to have trouble controlling their members, who in recent years have eagerly undermined what they view as the “establishment” in Congress.\n\nIt could also serve as a corrective to any sense on the part of Republicans looking forward to their party’s total control of the executive and legislative branches, that anything goes in the Washington of 2017.\n\nThe move generated an immediate outcry on social media after it began to be widely reported on Monday night.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), who introduced the proposal, was widely mocked on social media for his insistence that the plan, which he sponsored, actually “builds upon and strengthens” ethics oversight in the new Congress.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nGood government advocates blasted the move as a grave mistake.\n\n“If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE, it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics\n\nviolations were rampant and far too often tolerated,” the leaders of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats were also scathingly critical.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in a statement, “Republicans claim they want to ‘drain the swamp,’ but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions. Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.” Pelosi was Speaker of the House when the OCE was established.\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Plan to ‘Slam the Brakes’ on Trump’s Cabinet Nominees\n\nBy mid-morning, individual members of the Republican House majority were distancing themselves from the plan, releasing statements saying they would vote against the new rules package unless it was repealed.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump got into the act as well, tweeting out criticism that suggested he was upset more with the timing of the decision than with its substance: “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!”\n\nWhen time came to swear in the newly-elected members of the House of Representatives late Tuesday morning, many Republican members were notably absent from the chamber, instead attending an emergency caucus meeting to address the fallout from the rule change.\n\nShortly after noon, members leaving the meeting told reporters that the Goodlatte amendment to the rules was to be stripped out of the rules package, though some indicated that it might reappear at a less politically fraught time."

In doing so, the author of the measure declared that the move actually “builds upon and strengthens” the role of the ethics watchdog.\n\nWelcome to Washington in 2017, an Orwellian place where words, apparently, mean whatever politicians want them to mean.\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Plan to ‘Slam the Brakes’ on Trump’s Cabinet Nominees\n\nThis should come as no surprise. The nation is preparing to swear in a President-elect who campaigned on a promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington while simultaneously refusing to provide the public with his tax returns and who has still not provided any explanation of how he plans to avoid the conflicts of interest between his duties as president and his ownership of a multinational business.\n\nWithout facing serious objection, he has installed his own children, who will be running his business, on the transition team in charge of selecting the regulators who those businesses will have to answer to. If that’s what draining the swamp looks like, can anyone blame House Republicans for wanting to get in on the act?\n\nThe announcement Monday night of an amendment to the House Rules came from the office of Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), who authored the amendment gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent watchdog panel established in 2008 in response to a lobbying scandal that sent several members of Congress to prison for influence peddling.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nThe OCE was given the authority to initiate investigations into potential violations of ethics rules by members of the House. If it found sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, the OCE board could vote to submit a recommendation to the House Ethics Committee to begin formal proceedings.\n\nEven if the Committee declined to pursue a case recommended by the OCE, the details of the recommendation were later made public, a measure meant to deter members from quashing valid allegations of corruption or malfeasance.\n\nThe new rules, set to be finalized today, strip the OCE of both independence and transparency. A copy obtained by The New York Times can be found here.\n\nOperating under a new name, the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, the body will require the de facto permission of the Committee on Ethics to conduct an investigation. That's because the Ethics Committee, under the new rules, can shut down any investigation it wants to: “Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon receipt of a written request from the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct that the board cease its review of any matter and refer such matter to the Committee, the board shall refer such matter immediately to the Committee and cease its preliminary or second-phase review, as applicable, of that matter, and so notify any individual who is the subject of the review.\"\n\nRelated: Trump's Pick for Treasury Sends Fannie and Freddie Shares Soaring\n\nWhat’s more, the OCCR will be explicitly barred from making any information public -- to the point of being barred from hiring “any person for a position involving communications with the public, including a communications director or press spokesperson.”\n\nIn a statement issued Monday, Goodlatte said, “The amendment builds upon and strengthens the existing Office of Congressional Ethics by maintaining its primary area of focus of accepting and reviewing complaints from the public and referring them, if appropriate, to the Committee on Ethics. It also improves upon due process rights for individuals under investigation, as well as witnesses called to testify. The OCE has a serious and important role in the House and this amendment does nothing to impede their work.”\n\nBut Democrats and outside ethics watchdogs felt very differently.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was Speaker of the House when the OCE was created, said in a statement, “Republicans claim they want to ‘drain the swamp,’ but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions.

Bush, issued a joint statement as Chair and Vice Chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nIt said, in part, “Undermining the independence of the House’s Office of Congressional Ethics would create a serious risk to members of Congress, who rely on OCE for fair, nonpartisan investigations, and to the American people, who expect their representatives to meet their legal and ethical obligations.”\n\nThey added, “If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE, it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated.”"

    "text": "You don’t often see Donald Trump pull a punch, but he did it last week. Trump spent his entire campaign deeply angered by how the government treats veterans, particularly regarding their medical care. He promised to overhaul the Veterans Administration (VA) health care system and “take care” of the vets. Everyone has interpreted this as code for privatizing the VA, a long-awaited conservative goal.\n\nBut last week at Mar-a-Lago, after a meeting with health care executives about his VA plans, Trump told reporters this: “We think we have to have kind of a public-private option, because some vets love the VA. Definitely an option on the table to have a system where potentially vets can choose either/or or all private.”\n\nIf the current VA system is so reviled, so horrific, so offensive in its unfair treatment of veterans, why do “some vets” love it? Why must it be preserved as a choice?\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\nTrump appears to be running up against a typical problem for those favoring total overhaul to tweaks along the edges, especially in health care: People fear change over what they have. In the case of the VA, that’s certainly true for veterans, who like the current arrangement. And it’s also true of the privatization-friendly group of experts who looked at the VA just last year.\n\nLet’s back up: The VA is a unique feature of the U.S. health care system, more reminiscent of Britain’s National Health Service. Doctors and medical personnel work directly for the VA, and it owns the facilities where they operate. The rationale is that veterans experience several common combat ailments, from traumatic brain injuries to PTSD to amputations requiring prosthetics. Centralizing care at the VA allows for specialization on the unique needs of veterans, which private hospitals lack. The VA serves more than 8.9 million veterans a year at 1,233 facilities.\n\nTrump bases his stance on the VA mostly on a 2014 scandal about backlogs for patient care and falsifications of waiting periods, which led to the dismissal of several top officials. But as The Fiscal Times’ Rob Garver explained, the VA’s new leadership has already acted to reform the system and change the agency’s culture. Pending claims are way down, virtually all VA facilities extend same-day access to care and performance exceeds the private sector by nearly every measure.\n\nRelated: Most Veterans Say They Are Not Treated Well by the Government\n\nOn top of that, Trump’s preferred option of giving veterans the choice of VA or private care has already been implemented, with interesting lessons. After the backlog scandal, Congress passed a reform bill co-authored by Bernie Sanders, and as part of it, a pilot program gave veterans a Choice Card to use at private facilities if their local VA hospital is more than 40 miles away, or if the wait time is over 30 days. This theoretically ensures that no veteran has to wait for or be inconvenienced by seeking medical care.\n\nThe rollout has been shaky, mainly because the 90-day deadline Congress demanded for setting up the system meant that the VA had to turn to private contractors with a history of botching health care management. This has led to a secondary waitlist for those seeking difficult-to-access private care, along with numerous billing errors and questions of eligibility. There was also no setup for integrating care between VA and non-VA providers, which meant veterans skipping between the two could get duplicative or substandard care. While some have predictably used this to label the VA as incompetent, it says more about the hurdles to delivering a public/private hybrid.\n\nRepublicans have responded by advocating for a permanent Choice Card, allowing veterans to go to anywhere they want (oddly, they haven’t offered the same kind of single-payer card for the nation’s other 300 million-odd citizens to present at any medical facility). That mirrors the Trump plan of a “public/private option.” But that would further strain a hobbled scheme private contractors couldn’t figure out for a much smaller universe of patients. It would also double the costs of the current VA.\n\nRelated: Two Years After VA Scandal, System Still Stacked Against Vets\n\nIt’s clear that conservatives expect the private market to deliver better service than any public agency. The VA, they expect, would obviously wither on the vine if challenged by the free market. These true believers have perhaps never had to navigate the private health care system and its even longer wait times; comparatively the VA looks like a dream.\n\nRepublicans tried to lay the groundwork for back-door privatization. The 2014 VA reform legislation mandated a report from a bipartisan Commisson on Care on how to best redesign the VA. This was a stacked deck, widely expected to give Republicans a blue-ribbon pro-privatization report to “prove” their case. Three of the 15 commissioners were CEOs of health care companies that would financially benefit from breaking up VA hospitals; two others had ties to the Koch Brothers, who have bankrolled the privatization front group Concerned Veterans for America for years.\n\nBut a funny thing happened. The final report of the Commission on Care did not endorse privatization. It recommended enlisting credentialed community provider networks to increase capacity for veterans care, integrated with the VA’s electronic medical records system. The 18 recommendations largely tracked with what VA Secretary Robert McDonald has already been implementing.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Provide a Huge Tax Break to the 1 Percent\n\nWhen considering privatization, the commission sought feedback from the veterans themselves. Consistent with recent polling, the vets didn’t want the VA privatized. They preferred the quality of care at the VA and had problems with outsourcing treatment to non-VA providers. Veterans groups also prefer the current system. Transition officials reportedly met with 30 organizations last month, finding that they held near-unanimous opposition to privatization. American Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said of the VA recently, “there is no better care or value available anywhere in the United States — period.”\n\nSo like Trump, the Commission on Care pulled its punch. When you can’t even get a commission seeded with conservative ideologues to sign off on VA privatization, it shows the formidable nature of the task.\n\nThe VA continues to be demonized and maligned in conservative media, for the reading benefit of the large numbers of Americans who have no military experience. (Blaming the VA for over-prescription of opioids rather than the drug companies who relentlessly pushed them on patients as a miracle cure is just one example). But those who know and study the system find it indispensable. Maybe when Donald Trump names a VA secretary, they’ll figure that out too."

    "text": "Democratic leaders in the Senate promise a tooth-and-nail battle with Republicans over President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to a slew of senior cabinet positions. They’re calling for extensive financial reports, including tax returns, and demanding lengthy hearings with panels of witnesses and copious amounts of time for questions. They have also asked to limit the number of confirmation hearings that can be held in a single week.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, are envisioning an accelerated series of hearings and votes to have many of Trump’s picks installed by the time he is inaugurated or shortly after that.\n\nRelated: The Insiders Already Cashing In on the Trump Presidency\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he planned to do everything in his power to slam on the brakes. “President-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged cabinet with nominees that would break key campaign promises and have made billions off the industries they’d be tasked with regulating.”\n\nHe continued, “Any attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist. If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they're sorely mistaken.”\n\nBut there’s a problem. Whether that is indeed Republicans’ intentions, it’s not clear the GOP would be “mistaken.” Schumer and his fellow Democrats in the Senate enter the 115th Congress in what is arguably the weakest position a minority facing a slate of new presidential nominees has ever faced.\n\nIn 2014, Majority Leader Harry Reid, (D-NV) pulled the trigger on the long-threatened “nuclear option,” eliminating the filibuster for all presidential nominees other than Supreme Court Justices. When Republicans took over the Senate a few months later, they opted to keep Reid’s rule change in place.\n\nRelated: Trump Rips Obama on Transition ... Then Praises Him\n\nThat means that the Democratic minority has been stripped of its last-ditch defense -- preventing a vote on Trump’s nominees -- which makes Schumer’s vows of resistance ring hollow. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has little incentive to bow to a minority leader who possesses no real leverage.\n\n(To the extent Schumer has leverage, it is over legislation, which is still subject to the filibuster. If threats against future GOP legislative priorities count as leverage in the battle over nominees, Schumer could be argued to have at least some influence over McConnell. However, the Republicans have already signaled their intention to pack some of their top priorities -- including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and certain tax cuts -- into filibuster-proof budget reconciliation bills, which reduces the danger of seeing their agenda stymied.)\n\nDemocrats claim that the unique nature of the incoming Trump presidency -- one in which family members and a wide variety of friends and associates with no experience in government -- make it especially important to vet top nominees closely. Additionally, they argue, Trump’s outright refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of precedent, makes the finances of his cabinet choices all the more relevant.\n\nTrump’s nominee for Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, has been the target of particular attention, with Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including ranking member Ben Cardin (D-MD) demanding that he hand over his tax returns. That’s something that most cabinet nominees, except the Treasury Secretary and a handful of others, are not normally asked to do.\n\nRelated: Why Trump Needs to Take the Economy More Seriously\n\nDemocrats are promising to devote special attention to Tillerson, as well as to others nominees, including billionaire Betsy DeVos, an advocate of private sector educational initiatives who has been tapped to run the Department of Education, and fast food executive Andrew Puzder, who is set to run the Department of Labor.\n\nIn the end, though, the level of disruption Democrats can cause to the confirmation process will be limited primarily by how much Mitch McConnell wants to avoid negative news stories about the GOP steamrolling powerless Senate Democrats. Which is to say, Democrats probably won’t be able to do very much.\n\nMcConnell may throw Schumer a few bones in the interests of future cooperation, but barring a revolt among McConnell’s members, Trump’s cabinet will likely be in position in relatively short order."

    "text": "Spending on the federal food stamp program has gradually declined over the past two years as congressional Republicans and many states tightened eligibility requirements and the economy improved to the point that many dropped off the rolls after landing jobs.\n\nMore than 46 million Americans had been on food stamps in the depths of the recession or nearly one in every seven people. A three-percent drop in the multi-billion-dollar federal program resulted in 3.1 million fewer Americans receiving food subsidies under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in January 2016 than the year before, according to Treasury Department data.\n\nRelated: Food Stamp Use is Falling and the GOP Wants to Cut It Even More\n\nAs Republicans take control of the White House and Congress this month, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and other GOP leaders are signaling the possibility of a major welfare reform bill in 2017 or 2018, including a fresh look at the food stamp program and its spending levels. Ryan has proposed converting food stamps to a block grant and allowing states to determine how to spend a diminished level of funding.\n\nWhile lawmakers are certain to insist on stiff work requirements for able-bodied recipients and other eligibility rules, Republican lawmakers in two states -- Maine and Arkansas -- are eying additional potential savings by targeting beneficiaries who spend part of their monthly food subsidy on junk food and sodas, according to the Daily Signal.\n\nThe Obama administration’s Department of Agriculture previously rejected waiver requests from nine other states – including California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont – to prohibit beneficiaries from buying junk food with their food stamps.\n\nBut with a new Republican Trump administration taking charge Jan. 20, GOP officials in Maine and Arkansas believe they stand a much better chance of getting their waiver request approved by the USDA.\n\nRelated: $74 Billion Food Stamp Program in Budget Crosshairs\n\nThe push is being made with an eye toward improving public health and reducing health care costs as well as government food subsidies. State officials in Maine and Arkansas say that the ban on food stamp purchases of junk food would reduce their states’ obesity rates, contain Medicaid costs for low-income people and help ensure that beneficiaries use the program for its original intent – namely insuring a healthy diet for low-income families.\n\nProponents say the goal is to save lives and reduce health care costs by improving people’s diets, and not slashing overall spending or reducing the food stamp rolls. But depending on how the regulations are written, people caught purchasing forbidden junk food and soda could be suspended or even dropped from the program. Moreover, food stamp advocates such as the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities say the program already improves the diets and health of women and children.\n\nLast year, the House Budget Committee adopted a budget plan that would slash food stamp spending by more than $150 billion – or more than 20 percent – over the coming decade and change the program into block grants. CBPP analysts warn that cuts of that magnitude would force millions of low-income families out of the program and reduce the monthly benefits for those who remain on the rolls.\n\nArkansas ranks sixth nationally among all states in the rate of obesity, according to a 2016 national survey, posing a public health crisis among residents and a huge financial burden on the state and federal government. Medicaid and Medicare finance nearly 40 percent of the state’s alarming $1.25 billion annual obesity-related medical costs, according to a 2015 report by the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute.\n\nMary Bentley, a Republican member of the Arkansas Assembly, introduced a bill in early December to restrict what food stamp recipients are allowed to purchase. Although the bill doesn’t specifically bar the purchase of junk food and soda, Bentley told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that potato chips, soda and candy would be among the items that would be banned in the waiver request submitted to the USDA.\n\n“Chips and Cokes and candy bars,” Bentley told the newspaper as she enumerated the prohibited food. “People can go buy Red Bull with food stamps, and that’s not encouraging health.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services plans to submit a waiver request to the USDA shortly after Trump takes office. If the request is granted, Maine would be allowed to prohibit food stamp recipients from using their debit cards to buy sugary items such as candy and beverages.\n\nRelated: Food Stamp Use Plummets Amid Job Growth\n\nMary Mayhew, commissioner of the Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services, told the Daily Signal that while individuals are free to use their own money as they see fit, tax-payer funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance should be “directed based upon the policy intent of the program.”\n\nMaine’s Medicaid program spent more than $1.5 million between October 2014 and October 2015 on medical claims related to obesity, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services."

    "text": "Donald Trump tried to take credit for Sprint’s plan to create 5,000 jobs in the U.S. The plans were in place before the election, so there is some question about how much credit he should get. But Trump’s habit of claiming more credit than he deserves stands in sharp contrast to President Obama’s inability to communicate all of the good things that have happened during his presidency.\n\nA report by Catherine Rampell in The Washington Post cites a poll on Obamacare: Astonishingly, about a third of respondents believe the share of Americans without health insurance has risen in the last five years. Even a sizable chunk of Clinton voters (21 percent) believes this. In fact, the uninsured rate has fallen precipitously, and now stands at an all-time low.”\n\nRelated: Economists, Blogs, and Donald Trump\n\nOr, to cite another example, how many people know that Obama cut payroll taxes for workers in an attempt to stimulate the economy? Workers received a “Making Work Pay” tax cut of $400 ($800 for couples) that was distributed in small amounts in 2009 and 2010. Amazingly, it was intentionally underplayed based upon an idea from behavioral economics that the tax cut would stimulate the economy more if workers were unaware of it. There is some debate about how well the tax cut worked, but the point is that very few people were even aware that they received it.\n\nThe Obama administration’s lack of effective communication with the public was a big mistake. When Bill Clinton was president, it seemed like you could hardly turn on the TV without seeing someone vigorously and effectively defending his administration, and there was certainly no shortage of people defending George Bush. But, at least as I see it, the Obama administration did not benefit as much as it should have from effective spokespeople in the media (and where were members of the House and Senate for the past 8 years, they dropped the ball too).\n\nThere is a way in which the Obama administration communicated admirably, but unfortunately, it was mostly with policy wonks. What I will miss the most when Obama leaves office is the excellent work performed by his Council of Economic Advisers. The role of the CEA is to provide objective economic analysis that the president can use to make informed decisions.\n\nFor example, when George W. Bush was considering imposing a tariff on imported steel, the chair of the CEA at the time, Glenn Hubbard, warned him of the consequences for the US economy. Bush imposed the tariffs anyway (though they were rescinded two years later when other countries threatened to retaliate), but at least he did so with full knowledge of the potential harm it would do.\n\nRelated: Why the Public Has Stopped Paying Attention to Economists\n\nPresident Obama appointed top-notch economists to the CEA, and the work they have done on a variety of issues is careful and academically rigorous (for example, since August there have been reports on Active Labor Market Policies: Theory And Evidence For What Works, Labor Market Monopsony: Trends, Consequences, and Policy Responses, and The Performance of Community Banks over Time).\n\nOne piece of research, a report on Occupational Licensing, changed my mind. I have always thought about occupational licensing as a way to overcome a market failure due to lack of information about the quality of, say, medical procedures. The idea is that since consumers lack the knowledge needed to evaluate the quality of the service they receive, licensing and professional groups can police members and enforce quality standards. This is\n\nThis is useful and serves the interest of consumers, but the report convinced me it has gone too far. In many cases, licensing thwarts competition by erecting barriers to entry with no corresponding benefit to consumers, and it would be helpful to reevaluate the need for licensing using the guidelines given in the report.\n\nWhat we seem to be getting from the Trump administration, which has floated Larry Kudlow as head of the CEA – he has no formal training in economics – is a slate of appointments that will provide political cover for whatever the administration wants to do. I find that distressing. One of the most important roles of the CEA is to shut down bad ideas, but it looks as if it will be transformed into a cheerleading agency for whatever Trump proposes.\n\nI understand that macroeconomics has not performed perfectly in recent years, but it would be a mistake to use the shortcomings as a reason to throw out economic analysis altogether. There is a substantial body of both theoretical and empirical analysis of policies such as tax cuts for the rich, the imposition of tariffs, infrastructure spending, shutting down immigration, and the other things Trump has talked about. Even with policies I disagree with, there are good and bad ways to put them into place. Ignoring what economists have learned would be a big mistake.\n\nEven with policies I disagree with, there are good and bad ways to put them into place.

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump appears to be stepping up his effort to undercut the Obama administration’s retaliation against Russia for interfering in the Nov. 8 election by hacking into Democratic emails and leaking millions of documents to WikiLeaks that were damaging to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\nThe billionaire businessman vowed over the weekend to reveal in the coming days “things that other people don’t know about hacking” that could weaken the U.S. intelligence community’s indictment against Russian president Vladimir Putin, whom Trump is courting as a possible staunch ally in a reordering of global alliances.\n\n\n\nRelated: Trump and the GOP Are On a Collision Course over Russian Sanctions\n\nTrump has agreed to meet with U.S. intelligence officials this week to review their findings, which pretty much lay blame for the hacking at Putin’s doorstep. But the incoming Republican president has already declared it was time for the country to put the hacking controversy behind it and “move on to bigger and better things.”\n\nMeanwhile, his top spokesman, Sean Spicer, argued on the ABC News “This Week” that President’s Obama’s sanctions against Russia were disproportionate to the alleged offense. The government expelled 35 members of Russia’s diplomatic mission and closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland that were suspected of being spy nests. Obama also imposed sanctions on officials of Russia’s two main intelligence agencies.\n\nSpicer, who will be Trump’s White House press secretary, complained that the Obama administration did nothing to retaliate against China in 2015 for its involvement in breaching federal Office of Personnel Management records of 21.5 million people who had undergone background checks during the past 15 years.\n\nSpicer said that Trump and his advisers question the “magnitude” of the Obama administration retaliation against Russia after declining to take any punitive action against the Chinese government for hacking into millions of highly sensitive personnel documents.\n\nRelated: Trump Rips Obama on Transition ... Then Praises Him\n\n“The question is, is that response [against Russia} in proportion to the actions taken?” he said. “Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. We have to think about it. That’s nothing we have seen in modern history. . . for any action.”\n\n“So there is a question about whether there is a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response,” Spicer added.\n\nBut congressional Republicans and Democrats don’t see it that way, voicing outrage over Russia’s unprecedented meddling in a national election that may have influenced the outcome in Trump’s favor. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) are backing calls for a congressional investigation of the Russian hacking, while Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) and others are demanding much harsher sanctions against Russia than the ones ordered by Obama last week.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on “ABC This Week” that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA and others have produced “overwhelming evidence” of Russian involvement in the hacking. He also argued that what Russia did in trying to tip the election to Trump was a far graver offense than China stealing U.S. government personnel and financial information.\n\n“They didn’t just steal information, they weaponized it,” Schiff said of the\n\nRussian actions.\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nTrump has attempted to cozy up to Putin since early in the 2016 campaign when he praised the Russian for his strong leadership despite Putin’s aggressive action in annexing the Crimea and cracking down on domestic dissidents and journalists. Trump has blamed Obama and Clinton, the former secretary of state, for sour relations with Russia, and has promised to negotiate much better terms and relations with the Russians as the next president.\n\nTrump has frequently gushed over Putin’s leadership skills, especially after Putin complimented the billionaire businessman’s political style. And he praised Putin again on Friday for being “very smart” after the Russian leader announced that he would not retaliate against Obama’s decisions to expel Russian diplomats and impose new sanctions.\n\nThen, speaking to reporters Saturday evening outside his Palm Beach, Florida, club Mar-a-Lago, Trump promised to reveal information Tuesday or Wednesday about allegations of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign organization that might cast doubt on U.S. intelligence reports pinning responsibility on Putin and Russian agents.\n\nRelated: How Team Trump Is Changing the Rules of the Media Game\n\n“I just want them to be sure because it’s a pretty serious charge,” Trump said of the intelligence communities’ findings dating back to October. “If you look at the weapons of mass destruction [findings], that was a disaster, and they were wrong,” he added. That was a reference to highly inaccurate intelligence cited by President George W. Bush in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n“And I know a lot about hacking,” Trump said. “And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/01/Obamacare-Repeal-Will-Test-Definition-Insurance",
    "text": "Congressional Republicans, determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with an as-yet undefined alternative, are likely to find themselves wandering through a minefield of difficult policy problems when they return to Washington for the next Congress. These range from the fundamental question of what actually constitutes “health insurance coverage” to thorny questions about whether refundable tax credits would actually create the necessary incentive to encourage the uninsured to purchase coverage.\n\nWhile the Republican plan to replace the ACA isn’t fully-formed yet, it seems safe to assume that it will abolish the individual mandate that requires all individuals to have health insurance, repeal the expansion of Medicaid, slash minimum coverage requirements for plans sold in the non-group market, and allow insurers to sell policies across state lines.\n\nRelated: Obamacare RIP: Republicans Finally Have a Plan\n\nDemocrats have been warning for years that the impact of this combination of policies could be disastrous for the health insurance market. The individual mandate creates a risk pool that is much healthier -- and therefore cheaper to insure -- than a market where those least likely to need health care are free to opt out.\n\nCutting minimum coverage requirements will inspire health insurers to offer bare-bones policies that do little to insulate consumers from financial risk related to major health problems but provide just enough coverage to qualify for the refundable tax credit covering the premiums. Removing state-level regulation of health insurance, experts warn, could accelerate that race to the bottom.\n\nIn late December, the Congressional Budget Office issued a warning to Republicans in the form of a post to the agency’s blog. In it, authors Susan Yeh Beyer and Jared Maeda noted that the various proposals currently floating around Capitol Hill would be judged by both CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which score legislation for lawmakers as greatly reducing the number of Americans with health insurance.\n\nThis includes the Empowering Patients First Act, put forward by Georgia Congressman Tom Price, a physician himself and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRelated: Republicans Are Having Second Thoughts About Scrapping Obamacare Taxes\n\nCBO, which scores legislation for lawmakers to estimate costs and benefits, would not count someone as “insured” unless they had significant protection against major financial risk, they wrote. The proposals being aired by the GOP, by making it possible for companies to issue low-coverage policies, would likely leave many people outside that category.\n\n“If there were no clear definition of what type of insurance product people could use their tax credit to purchase,” they wrote, “some of those insurance products would probably not provide enough financial protection against high medical costs to meet the broad definition of coverage that CBO and JCT have typically used in the past—that is, a comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost medical events and various services, including those provided by physicians and hospitals.”\n\nBottom line, they said, “CBO and JCT would not count those people with limited health benefits as having coverage.”\n\nSome Obamacare policies are also on shaky ground in terms of consumers having adequate insurance coverage without exposing them to major financial risk. Insurance premiums are rising an average 25 percent this year and deductibles for silver plans will average $3,572 for individuals, while families will have to cover $7,474 before insurance pays a dime. The cheapest Bronze plans will cost individuals an average $6,000, while families will shell out $12,393 before insurance kicks in.\n\nWhile this may seem trivial, a finding from CBO and JCT that an Obamacare replacement plan would result in fewer Americans having health insurance would be a political problem for Republicans, from Trump on down, who have promised that their new plan would cover the same number of people, but for less money.\n\nRelated: 3 Years to Replace Obamacare? Republicans Are Wading Into a Quagmire\n\nBut whether or not particular policies that qualify for a tax refund are actually insurance in the real sense of the word is only one of the questions that would have to be answered under an ACA repeal program. Another is whether refundable tax credits would induce consumers to purchase health coverage in the first place.\n\nIn a blistering editorial this month, the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine argued that, at least in the context of Price’s Empowering Patients First Act, they would not.\n\nThe plan proposes eliminating the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid and replacing it with tax credits based on age. For example, people aged 18-to-35 would receive a credit of $1,200 per year, while people 50 and over would receive $3,000. The proposal, according to NJEM’s editors, would leave younger consumers paying more than $2,500 out of pocket for the most basic plan, while the bill for older consumers would approach $6,000. What’s more, the tax credits are not scaled to recipients’ income, meaning that low-earning consumers would pay a much larger share of their disposable income in health insurance costs than high-earners.\n\nThe Price tax credits, NJEM argues, are far too meager to encourage mass participation in the individual health insurance market.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\n“To put the plan’s subsidies into perspective, consider that in 1992 when per capita health expenditures were just one-third of what they are today, President Bush and HHS Secretary Sullivan proposed a slightly larger individual tax credit ($1,250) for the purchase of insurance than Price proposes today. Even in 1992, analysts reported that the credit would be insufficient to induce most people to buy coverage.”\n\nThe editorial’s criticism of the Price plan was not limited to the tax credit. It blasted the plan as a giveaway to doctors at the cost of reducing consumer protections.\n\n“In sum,” they wrote, “Price’s replacement proposal would make it much more difficult for low-income Americans to afford health insurance. It would divert federal tax dollars to people who can already buy individual coverage without subsidies and substantially reduce protections for those with preexisting conditions. The end result would be a shaky market dominated by health plans that offer limited coverage and high-cost sharing.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers have floated the idea of a lengthy phase-in period for their replacement plan, allowing them to symbolically “repeal” Obamacare while effectively leaving it in place for an indefinite period. They may need all the time they can get."

    "text": "In the wake of President Obama’s retaliatory sanctions against Russia for hacking Democratic emails and attempting to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 election, President-elect Donald Trump appears to be operating in a parallel universe from his GOP allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a rare act of agreement with President Obama, influential GOP leaders, including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, agree with Obama on an important international policy action, even while complaining that tough U.S. action against Russian president Vladimir Putin was long overdue.\n\nRelated: Trump Rips Obama on Transition ... Then Praises Him\n\n“Russia does not share American interests,” Ryan said in a statement Thursday after Obama ordered 35 members of the Russian diplomatic mission and their families to leave the country within 72 hours and closed two Russian diplomatic compounds in New York and Maryland that are suspected of being spy nests. “In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world.”\n\nMcCain has repeatedly denounced Putin – the architect of the Russian annexation of Crimea and a close ally of the ruthless Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – as a “murderer” and “thug” whose global ambitions must be reined in. He recently joined with Graham and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Jack Reed of Rhode Island in urging the creation of a Senate select committee on cyber that would focus not only Russian interference in U.S. politics but potential threats from other countries, including China and Iran.\n\nObama’s decision to crack down on the Russians, just three weeks before he leaves office, has had the effect of putting Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill on a collision course that could sour intra-party relations. Throughout the campaign, Trump spoke with great admiration for Putin’s tough leadership style -- saying he was a much better leader than Obama – and vowed as president to improve relations with the Russian leader.\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nWhile Trump and GOP leaders managed to patch up many of their policy differences after the election, including immigration, the economy and trade, many Republican leaders view Putin as a major threat to U.S. interests throughout the world. This explains why some Republicans question Trump’s judgment in nominating Exxon-Mobil chair Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Tillerson has worked closely with Putin over the years in negotiating oil production contracts in Russia and like other business people was awarded The Russian Order of Friendship.\n\nHenry Kissinger, speaking to the non-profit Committee of 100 on US-China relations, had another point of view. \"As head of Exxon, it’s his job to get along with Russia. He would be useless as the head of Exxon if he did not have a working relationship with Russia. We should not think about these relationships as the personal relationships of individuals,\" Fortune magazine reported.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community publicly blamed Russia in October for “interfering” in the U.S. election suggesting that Putin had a direct hand in the decision. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security then doubled-down on Thursday with samples of malware and other indicators of Russian cyber activity.\n\nIn a statement from Hawaii announcing his actions, Obama took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump for his seeming indifference and skepticism of the government’s charges against Russia, saying that “All Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions.”\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions\n\nWhile many congressional Republicans are as outraged as their Democratic colleagues over Russia’s intervention in the election, Trump only slightly veered from his long-standing pose of nonchalance and skepticism.\n\nTrump announced yesterday in West Palm Beach, Fla., that he would meet with U.S. intelligence officials next week “to be updated on the facts” in what will be one of his few intelligence briefings since winning the election.”\n\nTrump from the start has dismissed concern about the hacking of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails and their subsequent release by WikiLeaks as overblown and a way for Democrats to shift blame for losing the election. He said during a debate in September that the hacks could have been organized by “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”\n\nHis primary concern, he has indicated, is repairing U.S. relations with Russia that he said reached rock-bottom during the Obama administration when Clinton served as secretary of state.\n\nRelated: How Team Trump Is Changing the Rules of the Media Game\n\nIn his brief statement yesterday, Trump renewed his call for “our country to move on to bigger and better things,” but added that “in the interest of our country and its great people,” he would take the time to get an intelligence briefing.\n\nObama may have inadvertently done Trump a big favor by imposing sanctions against the Russians before he leaves office instead of leaving it to Trump to decide whether to take any action against Putin after he is sworn in Jan. 20. Trump could argue that his hands were tied and that he couldn’t readily repeal the sanctions without causing political upheaval within his own party.\n\nBut if Trump attempts to lift the sanctions on Russia next year after taking the helm at the White House, it could trigger a bitter fight within his own party that could spill over into other policy areas and even harm the prospects of winning Senate confirmation of Tillerson. It would also raise suspicion about his motives for reversing President’ Obama’s decision.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nWhen it convenes next week, the new Republican-controlled Congress will loom as a major player in determining further U.S. action in response to the Russian cyber attack, notes Claude Barfield, a resident scholar with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). There is mounting bipartisan support for a congressional investigation and possible further retaliatory action – regardless of what Trump says or threatens to do.\n\nThe only real dispute at this point is whether to create a special bipartisan committee with broad jurisdiction, as McCain, Graham and Schumer are pressing for, or allowing the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to handle the proceedings, as McConnell and Ryan are advocating."

    "title": "Is Trump’s VA Plan a Solution in Search of a Problem?",
    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/30/Trump-s-VA-Plan-Solution-Search-Problem",
    "text": "Donald Trump went a step closer to transforming the way the Department of Veterans Affairs delivers healthcare this week by sending an aide to brief reporters on a plan that could allow vets eligible for care at VA facilities to seek care from a private physician. That doctor or hospital would be reimbursed by the federal government in a program much like Medicare.\n\nThe President-elect spent considerable time and energy on the campaign trail bad-mouthing the VA system for what he described as disgraceful treatment of ailing veterans, including long wait times, poor service, and questionable care. Speaking to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in July, he said, “The VA scandals that have occurred are widespread and inexcusable.” He said they constituted “a permanent stain on this government.”\n\nRelated: Two Years After VA Scandal, Healthcare System Still Stacked Against Vets\n\nOn Wednesday, an aide outlined to reporters the plan under consideration to allow vets to seek care outside the VA system, saying there is “definitely an option on the table to have a system where potentially vets can choose either or, or all private.”\n\nHowever, it seems as though the idea -- not something that originated with the Trump administration -- isn’t quite fully baked yet. Among the questions being pondered by the incoming administration, the aide said, are some pretty basic ones: “How would you implement a program that could get vets the ability to go to any hospital that they wanted to go to?” and “If you were in the VA or out of the VA, how would you set it up?”\n\nThe problem here is that team Trump may well be dedicating scarce resources to a problem that is well on its way to being solved.\n\nThe VA, to be sure, was a national embarrassment a few years ago. In 2014 a wave of revelations found administrators falsifying documents in order to create the impression that they were compliant with departmental requirements regarding wait times. Veterans died while waiting for care, and overworked doctors began leaving the system in droves.\n\nRelated: Facing $1 Billion in Cost Overruns, VA Hospital Execs Head for the Exits\n\nHowever, that was before President Obama tapped Army veteran and former Proctor and Gamble chairman and CEO Robert McDonald to take over the system in an attempt to turn it around. McDonald stepped into the role of VA secretary in July 2014, and since then, according to two recent reports by outside groups, the results have been dramatic.\n\nMcDonald began by firing 14 of 17 top leaders in the system, replacing them with a combination of internal promotions, former high-ranking military officers, and private sector business executives. The mission, as McDonald described it, was to change the culture of the agency from a “rules-based” system to a “principles-based” system.\n\nCritics of the VA often described a department in which employees hewed closely to a rigid system of rules, often to the detriment of patients, because they knew that following the rules would keep their jobs safe.\n\nIn a study of the VA updated this month, the Harvard Business Review cited a particularly egregious example:\n\nThe leadership team had to work through vestiges of VA’s rule-based past. For instance, in May 2015, an employee answering the phone at the Puget Sound VA in Seattle received a call from a veteran who had broken his foot, driven himself to the hospital’s entrance and needed help getting into the building. Stymied by rules like don’t abandon your post, and advise patients outside the hospital to call 911 for assistance, the employee refused to go to the veteran and advised him to hang up and call 911. Ultimately, a team of Seattle firefighters was dispatched to the hospital’s parking lot to help the veteran from his car to the emergency room — a distance of 10 feet. In a rules-based organization, employees lack the flexibility of discretion.\n\nRelated: How Bureaucratic Red Tape Could Give a Convicted VA Exec Her Job Back\n\nHowever, according to the investigators from Harvard Business School, much has changed at the VA since McDonald took over.\n\n“Although the transformation remains ongoing, they have made considerable progress after two and a half years: Pending claims at VA have fallen by more than 90 percent; VA health care now performs better than the private sector on 96 percent of outpatient measures, according to RAND; and by the end of the year, all VA hospitals will offer same-day access to care, relative to none in 2014. In a survey conducted last month, 75 percent of veterans reported that VA effectively delivers care and services, up from 65 percent just a year ago.”\n\nWhat’s more, the improvement in care has led to veterans signing up for VA Care at record numbers -- to the point, Harvard noted, that wait times are on the rise again, this time due to demand, not inefficiency.\n\nThese don’t appear to be hallmarks of an organization in need of a massive shake-up but rather of one that had already endured the shake-up and is now showing marked improvement. The positive changes raise the question of whether the incoming administration should be considering a major privatization push at this point in the VA’s renaissance.\n\nIf you ask veterans’ groups now, the answer is obvious: No.\n\nTrump transition team members met with a number of veterans groups at the American Legion’s headquarters in Washington early this month. Afterward, the Legion’s executive director, Vera Jones, told Military.com that none of the groups were in favor of privatization.\n\n“The American Legion absolutely opposes privatization,” she said. “We strongly advocate for a healthy VA health care system for veterans.”"

    "text": "One of the biggest worries that critics of Donald Trump have about the incoming president of the United States is about who the soon-to-be leader of the most powerful nation on the planet listens to on specific issues. The answer, many fear, is the last person to speak with him.\n\nThat may or may not be true in general, but it appears to apply in at least one particular case: When the last person to speak with him happens to be the sitting president of the United States.\n\nRelated: How Team Trump Is Changing the Rules of the Media Game\n\nTrump began the day on Wednesday raging on social media about President Obama.\n\nDoing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016\n\nTrump never specified the statements that were bothering him, but Obama has been peppering his public statements in recent weeks with barely veiled warnings to Trump. And in a joint appearance at the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii Tuesday, he appeared to tweak his soon-to-be successor for appealing to anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S.\n\nAt the memorial, accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he said, “It is here that we remember that even when hatred burns hottest, the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward...We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.”\n\nWhether that statement qualifies as inflammatory is in the eye of the beholder, but it appeared to annoy Trump.\n\nRelated: Stock Trades by Trump’s Top Health Care Reformer Raise Some Swampy Questions\n\nAnd the President-elect wasn’t finished. Last week he expressed his anger at Obama for instructing his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from voting on a Security Council resolution that censured Israel for building settlements in both disputed territories and on land occupied by Palestinians. The abstention -- basically a refusal to employ the U.S. veto on Security Council matters -- allowed the measure to pass unanimously.\n\nHe renewed his criticism Wednesday, on Twitter, as usual.\n\n“We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,” he wrote. “They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!”\n\nIn the Trump era, the definition of “shocking” is regularly redefined when it comes to statements on international relations, but for a president-elect to send a direct public message to a foreign government that both criticizes the outgoing administration and makes unspecified policy promises is, at best, uncommon.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nThe well, it seems, had been poisoned. Trump had not only criticized his predecessor in public but had insinuated that the Obama administration had actively tried to make the presidential transition difficult.\n\nSo when reporters confronted the President-elect Wednesday afternoon and asked him about the status of his relationship with the outgoing president, there was some surprise when he said he thought things were going swimmingly.\n\nIn a brief exchange outside his residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump was asked about his tweet and about how the transition was progressing. “Oh, I think very, very smoothly. Very good. You don't think so?” he replied.\n\nThe difference? A phone call.\n\n“He phoned me,” Trump said when reporters asked whether he had spoken to the president. “We had a very nice conversation.”\n\n“We had a very general conversation,” he added. “Very, very nice. Appreciated that he called.”"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 17, 2016\n\nAfter objections from the Obama Administration, the ocean-monitoring drone was returned.\n\nTaking the drone was also seen a message to Trump. Patrick M. Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank, told The New York Times:\n\n“I see the snatched drone as a calculated act of coercive diplomacy approved at the top. I believe Beijing accelerated plans to create an early test for the new administration because Trump publicly called into question the One China policy and because China judged it safer to provoke Obama than an unpredictable Trump.”\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\nThe New Yorker Online made the case last week that Trump has taken a page from his best-selling The Art of the Deal and is being provocative with China to gain leverage. It cited the following tactic (whether conceived by Trump or his co-writer): “My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after. Sometimes I settle for less than I sought, but in most cases, I still end up with what I want.”\n\nWrote Jiayang Fan: “…Those words provide a notion of Trump’s self-image and, in conjunction with his Twitter tirades, a rough contour of his China strategy.”\n\nChina may also have taken a less obvious shot across Trump’s bow on Dec. 8 when it placed restrictions on the amount of money gamblers in Macau can withdraw from the ATMs of China UnionPay Co.\n\nWhat has that got to do with Beijing’s anger at the president-elect? It’s complicated.\n\nThere are limits on how much cash mainland Chinese gamblers are allowed to take across the border to the autonomous territory of Macau, which has been called the “Las Vegas of Asia.” So, about 50 percent of Chinese visitors use UnionPay ATM cards to withdraw more gambling money, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: Making Friends with Russia May Be Harder than Trump Seems to Think\n\nThe new restrictions sent shares of U.S. gambling stocks tumbling, including Wynn Macau, which opened the $4.2 billion Wynn Palace last summer and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVSC), which opened the $2.9 billion Parisian Macau in September. LVSC shares dropped by 13 percent.\n\nLas Vegas Sands is controlled by billionaire and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who along with his wife, Miriam, just happened to be Donald Trump’s biggest campaign contributors, giving more than $20 million toward his election.\n\nBeijing almost immediately softened the restrictions, putting a cap on per-transaction withdrawals and not imposing a daily limit. But the writing on the casino wall was clear: Retaliation can take many forms."

    "text": "Donald Trump hasn’t even been sworn in as the 45th president yet and already some of his earliest backers are realizing a sizeable return on their support.\n\nAs GOP nominee, Trump railed at the “hedge fund guys” whom he said were getting away with murder. Now, thanks to the president-elect’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, some of them are getting away with significant gains.\n\nRelated: Trump's Pick for Treasury Sends Fannie and Freddie Shares Soaring\n\nTrump the candidate (and Bernie Sanders) liked to lambaste Hillary Clinton for taking six-figure speaking fees from Wall Street firms, often singling out Goldman Sachs. But with Goldman alums and current executives being hired by the incoming administration and the market in the throes of a Trump rally, the firm’s stock is soaring, up 33 percent since Election Day.\n\nHere are some of the players enjoying early paydays:\n\nJohn Paulson\n\nThe hedge fund billionaire is a Trump advisor and donor. He famously scored by betting against the U.S. housing market in 2007, but was having a really bad year until Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said on Nov. 30 that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should not be controlled by the government. That sent their shares up 46 percent. The leap trimmed losses for the year at Paulson & Co.’s Advantage Fund to 9 percent from 16 percent, according to Bloomberg. Paulson and Mnuchin were both investors in the purchase, turnaround and sale of IndyMac bank, now OneWest (then again, so was Democratic mega-donor George Soros).\n\nRelated: Why Trump’s Conflicts of Interest Will Come Back to Bite Him … And Us\n\nCarl Icahn\n\nThe so-called corporate activist, a Trump campaign confidante and now the president-elect’s special adviser on regulatory reform, may also have made a killing on the run-up of Fannie and Freddie. In 2014, he took a $50 million position in the two through Fairholme Funds, one of the largest holders of preferred shares in the government-sponsored entities (GSEs). The market also apparently sees value in the 80-year-old Icahn’s ties to Trump: Shares of his Icahn Enterprises LP are up nearly 30 percent since Election Day and 7 percent since his appointment as special adviser was announced.\n\nGoldman Sachs Execs\n\nAmong the Goldman Sachs execs and alums appointed or nominated by Trump are the firm’s president and COO, Gary Cohn, who will lead the powerful National Economic Council and is seen as an emerging force on Team Trump; Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary nominee; and senior White House strategist Steve Bannon. Goldman stock is up more than 30 percent since Election Day, and that could bolster the value of Cohn exit package substantially. Bloomberg valued it at more than $266 million, amassed over 25 years, on Dec. 9.\n\nCorey Lewandowski\n\nThe hard-nosed political operative who guided the Trump campaign in its early days is opening a lobbying shop down the street from the White House, the Washington Examiner first reported on Dec. 21. The exclusive by David Drucker said Lewandowski and partner Barry Bennett, who also advised Trump, use their biographies to “emphasize their closeness to Trump and, presumably, their ability to get clients’ priorities in front of the president.”"

    "text": "Donald Trump has declared that things will be “different” on the international stage when he is in the Oval Office, promising among other things that he will mend relations with Russia, achieve peace in the Middle East, and get tough on Iran. But the complicated foreign policy world that the President-elect is inheriting may not bend itself to his will quite as easily as he appears to expect.\n\nOn Tuesday, two powerful Republican members of the Senate made it clear that they have no intention of allowing the U.S. Intelligence Community’s assessment that Russian-backed computer hackers interfered in the U.S. presidential election to be swept under the rug, even though the incoming president from their own party says he doesn’t believe it really happened.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nSens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) gave an interview to CNN during a trip to the Baltic nation of Estonia and promised that there would be a full investigation of Russian involvement in the presidential election, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe was given the green light by Russian President Vladimir Putin -- whether President-elect Trump likes it or not.\n\n“There are 100 United States senators...I would say that 99 of us believe the Russians did this, and we’re going to do something about it,” Graham told CNN’s Jim Sciutto. “We’re going to put sanctions together that hit Putin as an individual and his inner circle for interfering in our election, and they're doing it all over the world -- not just in the United States.”\n\nMcCain continued to express his worries about Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, saying that that the oilman’s close ties to Russia concern him. McCain’s worries echo those of many in Congress who are dubious about Trump’s professed desire to bring the U.S. and Russia closer together at a time when the Kremlin’s military adventures in Ukraine and Syria are attracting international censure.\n\nBut Trump’s willingness to embrace Russia, and Tillerson’s business ties to the country and a reportedly warm personal relationship with Putin, will only go so far in a world where Russian and American interests are sharply diverging, warns James Dobbins, a senior fellow and distinguished chair in diplomacy and security at the Rand Corporation.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuclear Tweet: A Response to Putin?\n\n“[A]ssuming he is confirmed as secretary of state, [Tillerson] will immediately face an unusually broad array of challenges,” Dobbins writes. “Some of these derive from the unusually disordered state of the world, others from the unusually wide uncertainty about the new American president's intentions.”\n\nAmong the biggest jobs Tillerson will face, Dobbins says, will be balancing Trump’s promises about getting tough on Iran with the reality that the Islamic Republic is a de facto partner of Russia’s in the ongoing conflict in Syria.\n\n“Trump seems inclined to accommodate Russia while confronting Iran,” Dobbins writes. “In Syria, where the two are effectively allied, this does not seem feasible. Neither does Russia seem likely to join in abrogating the five power nuclear accord with Iran, or in re-imposing international sanctions. Neither will it be possible to both push back Iran and reduce American exposure in this volatile region. Choices will need to be made.”\n\nAnd Russia doesn’t appear inclined to do much in the way of making things less complicated for Trump in the Middle East.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Nuke Talk Could Break the Budget or Much, Much Worse\n\nLast week, for example, Trump took the unusual step, for a president-elect, of calling for the current administration to take specific action on an upcoming vote in the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council was about to vote on a resolution censuring Israel for its construction of settlements on both disputed territory and on territory that belongs to Palestinians.\n\nThe rumor circulating was that the U.S., in a departure from normal practice, would abstain from voting on the resolution rather than exercise its Security Council veto power.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Trump declared, “The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed. As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations. This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.”\n\nHaving made his position abundantly clear, Trump was handing his ostensible future ally, Putin, an opportunity to show some good faith.\n\nRelated: How Team Trump Is Changing the Rules of the Media Game\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly made a last-minute phone call to Putin on the day of the vote, urging the Russian President, who controls his country’s Security Council veto, to block the resolution. The result wasn’t exactly an endorsement of the Israeli position.\n\nAccording to the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations made a pro forma effort to at least delay the vote last week, complaining that there had not been enough time to debate the resolution. But when it came to a vote, the Russian ambassador not only allowed the measure to proceed without a veto but voted in favor of it."

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to rebuild the U.S. military into an unparalleled global fighting machine, fueling prospects that the GOP-controlled Congress will go along with raising defense spending well above its current $600 billion annual level in the coming years.\n\nBut by declaring last week in a tweet that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” Trump has raised the ante of long-term spending by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy and threatens to spawn a new nuclear arms race with Russia, China, North Korea, Pakistan and other rivals and enemies.\n\n\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nIt is impossible to gauge the potential budgetary implications of what the billionaire businessman has in mind because Trump has provided no details. For instance, it’s unclear whether he is talking about going well beyond the Obama Administration’s current pricey modernization program for the U.S. nuclear arsenal, or whether he would scrap the New Start treaty between the U.S. and Russia that caps nuclear warhead deployment and mandates regular inspections.\n\n“This is an attitude, not a policy,” Gordon Adams, a defense policy expert, said in an interview this week. “He’s not giving you anything…to stand on in terms of what he means by ‘expand.’”\n\nYet, by raising the issue weeks before he is sworn in as the 45th president, Trump has opened the door to a renewed debate on U.S. nuclear defense strategy that could lead to the government committing tens of billions of dollars more to Pentagon spending in years to come.\n\nAlthough he vowed to substantially reduce the threat of nuclear weapons during his first term, President Obama in his second term embarked on an ambitious program designed to upgrade the nation’s warheads and launch systems -- including the missiles, bombers and submarines that deliver the warheads.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a ‘Coup d’Etat’\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that over the coming decade, the Obama administration’s plan for nuclear force modernization, maintenance and operations will cost $348 billion, or an average of about $35 billion a year. The CBO study released in January 2015 said that over the coming two decades, Congress will need to make decisions about the extent to which “essentially all of the U.S. nuclear delivery systems and weapons will be modernized or replaced with new systems.”\n\nWhile the government doesn’t provide comprehensive figures for the amount of federal resources that go to all aspects of nuclear defense, the Defense Department and the Department of Energy spent an estimated $42.3 billion on the nuclear program in 2015, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nAbout $23.9 billion of that total went for nuclear forces and operational support. The remainder of spending covered missile defense operations, environmental cleanup of nuclear waste and programs to reduce the global nuclear threat, according to the NTI, an anti-nuclear proliferation research organization.\n\nEstimates of how much the government spends on its nuclear weapons program and stockpile vary significantly. But there is no question that spending as a share of the budget has plummeted substantially since the peak of the U.S.-Soviet Union nuclear weapons race during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.\n\nRelated: Was Trump’s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nThroughout the 1960s and early 1970s, nearly two of every 10 dollars spent by the Defense Department went for developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons. Decades of subsequent Cold War negotiations and détente gradually shrank the U.S. and Russian stockpiles of strategic nuclear weapons from tens of thousands to roughly 7,000 each – with even deeper reductions called for under the New Start treaty.\n\nToday, spending on nuclear weapons accounts for just 2.5 percent of overall defense and national security operations, according to some estimates. However, that share is estimated to climb to four percent or five percent over the coming decade under Obama’s remodeling program\n\nTrump’s tweet and subsequent comments to MSNBC’ Mika Brzezinski suggesting he would welcome a renewed nuclear arms race with Russia and others set off alarm bells among nuclear weapons experts and anti-nuclear advocacy groups fearful of a potential global catastrophe -- let alone the added costs to the military.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Must Now Reveal the True Cost of War to All Americans\n\n“The use of even a single nuclear weapon, anywhere in the world, would be a global humanitarian, environmental and economic disaster,” Derek Johnson, the executive director of Global Zero, said in a statement last week., according to the New York Times. “A nuclear buildup in the U.S. and Russia only makes that nightmare scenario more likely.”\n\nAdams, a professor emeritus at American University who specializes in military history, said that “the Obama plan is expensive enough – and in the judgment of many not necessary – or at least elements of it are debatable.”\n\n“Again, what Trump would do, if anything, in addition” to Obama’s proposals “is anybody’s guess,” he said. “It’s just not clear what it would be.”"

    "text": "After a brief Christmas Day break, President-elect Donald Trump re-emerged on Twitter, his pulpit of choice, mixing self-promotion, vague suggestions about foreign policy and questionable statements about his charitable foundation in a storm of post-holiday tweets. According to incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, that approach is likely to be the norm as the country moves forward into 2017.\n\nIn an interview with a television station in his home state of Rhode Island over the weekend, Spicer said to expect Trump to continue to go directly to the public via social media rather than relying on traditional filters like the White House press office and the media.\n\nRelated: How Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart Helped Elect Trump\n\n“He does communicate in a much bigger way than ever’s been done before, and I think that’s going to be a really exciting part of the job,” said Spicer, currently the chief strategist and communications director for the Republican National Committee.\n\n“I think that his use of social media in particular … is gonna be something that’s never been seen before,” Spicer told WPRI. “He has this direct pipeline in the American people, where he can talk back and forth.”\n\nWhile it might not come as a great surprise to the nation’s diplomatic corps, it serves as confirmation that an era of carefully considered and closely vetted statements about international affairs is probably coming to an end.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump continued fulminating about the decision by the Obama administration last week to abstain from voting on a U.N. Security Council measure censuring Israel for building settlements in both disputed territory and on land owned by Palestinians. Israel and its most hardline supporters in the U.S. had called on the Obama administration to veto the resolution, and were infuriated when it was allowed to pass.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on the Threat of a Nuclear Arms Race\n\nIn a notable break from protocol, Trump last week called for a veto in advance of the vote and then criticized the sitting president’s administration for not taking his position, promising -- in a tweet, naturally -- “As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.”\n\nOn Monday, he blasted the U.N. in general, writing, “The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!”\n\nThe president-elect’s return to social media after the holiday appears to have been jump-started by remarks President Obama made in an interview Monday suggesting that be believes that he could have beaten Trump had it been legal for him to run for a third term.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nIt was that remark that prompted the president-elect’s first post-Christmas tweet, late Monday afternoon, in which he declared, “President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.”\n\nIt was as if a dam had finally broken, and Trump’s brief Christmas silence was no more.\n\nHe followed up shortly thereafter by claiming that his election had lifted a pall of gloom from the planet, and that a rising stock market and holiday spending increases were also due to the prospect of a Trump presidency.\n\nThe world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016\n\nRelated: Obama Just Made It Harder for Trump to Create a Muslim Registry\n\nThen, though, Trump moved on to different territory. News broke over the weekend that he would be shutting down the controversial Trump Foundation, which Trump has repeatedly characterized as a benevolent charitable organization, to avoid conflict of interest charges during his time in the Oval Office.\n\nThe problem, though, was that much of what Trump said about his foundation was either exaggerated or flat out untrue, something that is now widely known thanks to the dogged reporting of The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold.\n\n“I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or [received] millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!” Trump wrote.\n\nIn fact, Trump has not personally donated a penny to the Trump Foundation since 2009. In recent years, much of the money given to the foundation has come from professional wrestling impresarios Vince and Linda McMahon. Mrs. McMahon was recently nominated to serve as a member of Trump’s cabinet, helming the Small Business Administration. Trump also has a history of soliciting money from other charitable organizations, and then repackaging that money as a donation from the Trump Foundation.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nTrump’s claim that “ALL” of the donations to the foundation have gone to charitable causes was echoed in a follow-up tweet.\n\n“The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!”\n\nUnfortunately, that is also pretty clearly untrue. The Post’s Fahrenthold uncovered multiple examples of the Trump Foundation spending money impermissibly, including the purchase of large portraits of Trump himself and professional sports memorabilia, which Trump used to decorate his commercial properties. More controversially, the foundation has been accused of using its funds to settle legal debts owed by Trump’s for-profit business. The attorney general of the state of New York is currently investigating the Trump Foundation for various violations of law governing non-profits, and the Trump Foundation itself has admitted to breaking rules against self-dealing in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTrump’s incoming White House staff is putting a brave face on their boss’s determination to continue using Twitter and other social media platforms to communicate with the public, but the intense media pressure that comes with the Oval Office is going to amplify apparent policy statements, misleading claims and outright falsehoods even well beyond the considerable range Trump already has as president-elect.\n\n“Exciting” may not be the word incoming press secretary Spicer and his colleagues are using to describe the president’s social media habits a few months from now."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/12/27/Why-Dow-Struggling-Break-Through-20000",
    "text": "Can the Dow finally push past 20,000? Market bulls are trying again after failing to lift the index over the threshold over the last two weeks — unable to muster the last ounce of strength needed to bag this psychological milestone before the long Christmas weekend.\n\nThe extended struggle is surprising given the market's tendency to nab fresh highs ahead of holiday breaks and the historic strength of the post-election uptrend. The Dow has climbed for seven consecutive weeks, a run unmatched since the \"Bullard bounce\" of late 2014 that ended the Ebola scare stocks suffered in October that year.\n\nAnd the failure to take 20,000 is downright odd considering just how lofty expectations are heading into 2017. Perhaps some apathy is setting in?\n\nRelated: 10 Ways the Energy Markets Could Surprise Us in 2017\n\nTo be sure, investors and money managers are loaded up. The latest survey of active money managers from the National Association of Active Investment Managers, as cited by SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert, shows optimism near the highest levels in history.\n\nFundamental expectations are strong as well. S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to total 3 percent in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet, with growth accelerating into 2017 for a full-year result of 11.4 percent — definitively putting the 2015-2016 earnings recession to bed. And according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow real-time estimate, GDP growth is expected to clock in at 2.5 percent for the fourth quarter, an acceleration from the tepid pace seen at the start of the year.\n\nOf course, many of the bulls’ hopes rest on the notion that President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy will deliver increased disposable income for consumers, an infrastructure spending splurge and a corporate repatriation tax holiday that will ultimately boost share buybacks.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Repeal Could Provide a Huge Tax Break to the One Percent\n\n^DJI data by YCharts\n\nSo why do investors keep getting cold feet as the Dow flirts with the 20,000 threshold?\n\nPerhaps it’s the weight of market history, as investors realize that major thresholds for the Dow often indicate medium-term high water marks. Dow 100 proved troublesome throughout the 1910s. Dow 1,000 set the ceiling for the market between 1964 and 1982. Dow 10,000 was won, lost and won again in a decade-long, back-and-forth battle that finally ended in 2010.\n\nMore recently, the Dow struggled to break north of the 18,000 level from late 2014 through July 2016.\n\nOne other possible explanation is that Wall Street equity strategists are, on the whole, surprisingly dour on the outlook for 2017, mainly on valuation fears and the drag from higher expected interest rates. According to Goepfert, the average strategist expects the S&P 500 to end 2017 barely 4 percent ahead of where it is now. That's the weakest annual gain estimate since forecasts for 2003 were being made in late 2002, when war with Iraq loomed.\n\nRelated: Oil Rises Further Above $55 as Looming Supply Cuts Provide Support\n\nThis is notable for two reasons. One, normally strategists just add 9 percent or so to wherever stocks are trading heading into the holidays and call it good. So this is unusually cautious. Second, there has been a large reduction in the variability of these forecasts — many of the 2017 targets are between 2,300 and 2,350 — indicative that some groupthink is setting in.\n\nHere's the nerve-rattling kicker: The last time groupthink was in play to such a degree was at year-end 2007, when strategists were looking for a 9 percent gain in 2008. Instead, the market crashed nearly 40 percent."

    "text": "When the legendary five-star general Henry “Hap” Arnold founded the Air Force as an independent service following World War II, he built a strong constituency among members of Congress and the skilled workers in their districts. It came to be known as “geographic peanut-buttering.”\n\nRather than having the Air Force or a small coteries of private manufacturers build the next generation of fighter aircraft, Arnold broke up the contracts into smaller pieces and awarded them to aircraft plants and parts suppliers throughout the U.S. “It was like spreading peanut butter across the country,” explained Gordon Adams, a military historian. And it created enormous good will for the Air Force.\n\nRelated: Trump Dumps on F-35 Contract and Calls for ‘Lifetime’ Ban on Revolving Door\n\nOver the years, the Air Force and other branches of the military have perfected the art of “peanut-buttering.” And this helps to explain why Lockheed Martin’s highly controversial and costly F-35 Joint Strike Force will survive and thrive in the coming years, regardless of President-elect Donald Trump’s threat last week that he might abandon it in favor of a less expensive jet fighter.\n\nTrump momentarily stunned the defense industry and caused a substantial dip in Lockheed Martin’s stock by tweeting that cost overruns in the $400 billion program to develop a new generation of stealth jet fighters had prompted him to ask rival Boeing to “price out” a comparable F-18 Super Hornet – although the F-18 lacks many of the F-35’s stealth features. Trump had earlier complained that the $100 million-per-copy cost of the F-35 was “out of control” and vowed to negotiate big savings.\n\nBut extracting huge additional concessions from Lockheed Martin after the company agreed to previous cuts won’t be easy, even though the F-35 remains the Pentagon’s costliest military hardware project in history. That’s because the project is slathered in peanut butter.\n\nThe F-35 program boasts a supply chain that reaches out to practically every state in the country. While government watchdogs and critics have long derided the project’s runaway costs and frequent setbacks, the F-35 program has generated tens of thousands of jobs in 45 states and enjoys strong bipartisan support throughout Congress.\n\nThe F-35 is a stealthy state-of-the-art jet fighter designed to span the military services for the U.S. and its allies, including Israel, Canada and Great Britain. There are three distinct models that take off and land in conventional ways, do short takeoffs and vertical landings, and that are launched from aircraft carriers using a catapult.\n\nRelated: Trump Says No to Daily Redundant Intel Briefings Because He's a 'Smart Person'\n\nLockheed Martin has teamed up with more than 1,250 suppliers to produce thousands of components for the complex aircraft system, including sophisticated radar sensors and parts of the aircraft’s fuselage, according to the company. Overall, the F-35 program is responsible for more than 146,000 U.S. jobs, according to an Associated Press report.\n\nSome 18 states have counted on the F-35 for $100 million for more of economic activity throughout the life of the contract, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. The program is responsible for 38,900 jobs in Texas alone and close to 10,000 in Connecticut.\n\n“This is the thing that is going to make it devilishly difficult for Trump or anybody else to do anything about it,” said Adams, a professor emeritus of foreign policy at American University. “I’m staggered that a president of the United States thinks he’s going to negotiate hardware contracts. That’s already an act of chutzpah beyond recognition. In the end, I don’t think the contract is going to be terribly different.”\n\n“What it says,” he added, “is that it’s really hard to cancel one of these pups . . . But what Trump is not going to do is cancel the program. The geographic peanut-buttering makes sure that he isn’t going to cancel the program.”\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Is Planning a New Super Rival to the Troubled F-35\n\nIndeed, for all of Trump’s harrumphing about costly military contracts, Congress controls the defense budget and makes the final decisions on which programs stay in or come out. Todd Harrison, a defense budget authority with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the AP that while the F-35 had massive budget overruns in the initial stages, the cost has stabilized and even dropped a little following tough negotiations between Pentagon officials and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStill, the project has nearly doubled in cost since its inception, and the lifetime cost of the F-35 could reach $1.5 trillion, according to some estimates.\n\n“Trump is unlikely to squeeze more blood out of this rock,” Harrison said."

It was Huma Abedin, Jen Palmieri, Robby Mook and the other ineffective mooks advising the candidate and running the campaign.\n\nThen it was FBI Director James Comey again.\n\nAnd The Daily Beast’s Michael Daly makes a forceful case that old goat Bill Clinton might be more than a convenient scapegoat.\n\nRelated: Clinton Lawyer Blasts FBI After Email Search Warrant Release\n\nWho then should really take the rap for Hillary Clinton’s devastating loss of the presidency, despite blowing through hundreds of millions of dollars on the way to a blow-out victory in the popular vote?\n\nProbably all of the above to one degree or another, plus she of the uber-caution, the not-so-great instincts, the tired rhetoric and the comparatively low energy.\n\nBut for those suffering from PTTD (post-traumatic Trump disorder) -- still snapping awake in a fury every morning, wild-eyed and hungry to assign blame -- there are two comics cowering in the wings and looking sheepish who shouldn’t be allowed to get away scot-free.\n\nYes, we’re talking about you, Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart.\n\nLike the rest of liberal-lefty America – at least those who didn’t have the good sense to back Bernie – Colbert and Stewart no doubt expected the coronation-that-wasn’t.\n\nRelated: Clinton Aide Abedin Seeks to Review Clinton Emails Search Warrant\n\nThat made it safe in the late summer of 2015 for Stewart to pack up his skewer (presumably after wiping off the right-wing blood) and head to his farm, where he shelters abused animals (but not abused conservatives), leaving The Daily Show in the hands of the unmemorable Trevor Noah.\n\nThat also made it convenient a month later for Colbert to wrap The Colbert Report, the insanely addictive parody of the Republican Right, and go sort-of-serious as the replacement for late-night Letterman on CBS.\n\nSo just as Donald Trump began to emerge as a serious contender for the Republican nomination, one of the voices that could have eviscerated him four nights a week went silent and the other went mainstream.\n\nSure, there were roastings on Saturday Night Live, but Alec Baldwin as the fake Trump didn’t debut until late in the campaign, and Lorne Michael allowed the Real Donald to host the show in November 2015, showing him to be a good sport and further legitimizing his candidacy.\n\nRelated: Most Forecasters Predict a Win for Clinton, Except for Two\n\n(No one, of course, did more to portray Trump as a guy who can be playful and engaging than the sycophantic Jimmy Fallon, who was permitted to tussle The Hair.)\n\nO.K., there was Samantha Bee’s Full Frontal and John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight, but the Bee never learned to float like a butterfly and knows only how to sting. That gets old fast.\n\nThere is a certain stridency to Oliver, too, plus both are once a week, and Last Week Tonight is on HBO, which not everyone pays for.\n\nThat is not to say that either Stewart or Colbert had massive audiences on Comedy Central: When Stewart repaired to his barn, he had about 1.5 million nightly viewers and Colbert had even fewer.\n\nStill, you could expect them both to be relentless, savaging Trump and the Republicans in takedowns gone viral; you can picture Stewart luring in the attention-addicted Trump for a vicious sit-down; you can even dream about either Colbert or Stewart getting in a Twitter war with the Commander-in-Chief-to-be.\n\nRelated: How a Surprising Twist in the Latino Vote Gave Florida to Trump\n\nIn fact, you don’t have to dream about it: Trump and Stewart once went tweet-to-tweet, as Stewart related in a hysterical benefit performance on November 1. In that exchange, Trump first tweeted in April 2013: “I promise you I am much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz – I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow. Who, by the way, is totally overrated.”\n\nThat was followed by more Trump tweets about Stewart changing his name and not cherishing his heritage.\n\n“So I start to think to myself,” Stewart says in his stand-up, “‘I think this guy is trying to let people know I’m a Jew.’ And I think to myself, ‘Doesn’t my face do that?’”\n\nFinally, Stewart tweets back: “Many people don’t know this, but Donald Trump’s real name is F**kface Von Clownstick. I wish you would embrace the Von Clownstick heritage.”\n\n(“You remember, by the way,” Stewart says in an aside, “Lincoln used to get into this sh** all the time with people.”)\n\nThe Twittersphere picks up on the duel and soon Trump tweets: “What’s funny about the name F**kface Von Clownstick – it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz – he stole it from some moron on twitter.”\n\nStewart tweets back: “We seem to have hit a F**kface Von Nervestick.” After four days of radio silence, Trump tweets back at 1:30 am: “Little Jon Stewart(?) is a p***y, he would be hopeless in a debate with me!”\n\nClearly, debates were on his mind years before he declared himself a candidate in 2015.\n\nGiven how easy it is to get under Trump’s thin skin, it’s not hard to imagine months of battles like that enraging and consuming the then-GOP nominee. His mind would be off the campaign as he worried into the wee hours about being a laughingstock on Twitter.\n\nAnd America might not be preparing to inaugurate President Von Clownstick."

    "text": "Over the past decade, Washington, DC has tried all sorts of things to stimulate economic growth: tax cuts, stimulus spending, rock-bottom interest rates, and more. But one of the key ingredients in any recipe for long-term growth is requires something Americans can only do for themselves: having babies.\n\nPopulation growth is needed to keep economies growing. The relationship is complex, of course -- a population that grows faster than increases in productivity, for instance, can be a problem -- but in general, economists believe that there is a strong correlation between population growth and long-term economic growth.\n\nRelated: What a Trade War With China Could Do to the Economy\n\nIn the United States, the population growth rate is now a low not seen since the Great Depression, according to a study by William H. Frey, a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. In the 2015-2016 period, the U.S. population increased by only 0.7 percent. That’s compared to a rate of about .95 percent, on average, over the past 70 years, and spikes as high as 2.1 percent during the height of the post-World War II Baby Boom.\n\n“It is likely that some of the reduced fertility in recent years is attributable to recession-related delays in family formation among young adult millennials; this trend could reverse in the near future as the economy continues to grow,” Frey writes. “But higher death rates are likely to continue due to the long-term aging of the population, a phenomenon contributing to projected declines in U.S. growth rates, which could drop as low as 0.5 percent in 2040.”\n\nNew babies, of course, aren’t the only source of population growth. Throughout its history, the U.S. has seen economic growth boosted by waves of immigrants who take part in the economy as both workers and consumers.\n\nHowever, immigration rates are also down in recent years, and Congress has been reluctant to pass sweeping immigration reform laws. The conclusion of a presidential election in which the winner spent much of his time promising to build a wall along the Mexican border and otherwise move to block new entries to the U.S. makes it seem unlikely that major immigration reform will be in the offing anytime soon.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nWithin the United States, Western States and Southern States in the “Sun Belt” are experiencing significantly faster growth than the nation as a whole, driven in part by internal migration.\n\n“Overall,” Frey writes, “the United States seems to be in the midst of a population growth paradox: As the nation’s population growth continues to stagnate due to fertility declines in the context of an aging population, internal population shifts help places like the Sun Belt continue to grow. Because the latter is more economically driven than former, it is encouraging to see that a key demographic indicator of a strong economy – migration in response to newly emerging employment opportunities – is reviving in tandem with the economy.”\n\nBut it could be worse, Frey notes. The U.S. population is growing slowly, but at least it isn’t shrinking.\n\n“Several other industrialized countries, such as Japan, Germany, and Italy are facing the specter of long-term population decline,” he writes. “By comparison, the United States can look forward to continued population growth, albeit at lower levels, for decades to come.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/23/Stock-Trades-Trump-s-Top-Health-Care-Reformer-Raise-Some-Swampy-Questions",
    "text": "On the face of it, at least, the stock trades look pretty fishy. Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for secretary of health and human services, traded more than $300,000 in shares of health-related companies over the past four years, even while sponsoring major legislation that could affect those companies.\n\nPrice, one of the leading opponents of the Affordable Care Act, bought and sold stock in roughly 40 health care, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies since 2012, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Yet technically he did nothing wrong within a government institution notorious for its weak ethics rules.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nPrice, a wealthy surgeon and the chair of the House Budget Committee, bought and sold stocks in prominent drug and health care companies including Bristol Meyers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Pfizer and Aetna, according to the report.\n\nThe Georgia Republican sits on the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, which oversees Medicare, Obamacare and other government health care programs.\n\nOver the past several years he has sponsored or co-sponsored 44 bills that could have important financial repercussions for the nation’s health care, insurance and drug manufacturing industries. A spokesman for Price, Phil Blando, told The Wall Street Journal that the conservative lawmaker takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously and has complied with all relevant laws.\n\nHowever, Democrats are sure to question Price about the scope and timing of his financial dealings during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearings next month. And some government ethics experts say that even if Price’s investment activities were all above board, the fact that a highly influential lawmaker invested in companies that could be impacted by his legislative action unavoidably raises suspicions and doubts. “It undermines the public trust,” Michael Carome, director of the nonprofit Public Citizen’s Health, told Roll Call.\n\nCongressional ethics rules give members extraordinary leeway in managing their financial portfolios. There is nothing in the House ethics rules that can prevent a member from buying and selling shares of stock, even if the committees on which they serve have jurisdiction over companies or industries in which the member has invested. As long as they publicly disclose those transactions, lawmakers are free to invest their money as they see fit.\n\nRelated: GOP Cuts in Medicare May Be Next After Dismantling Obamacare\n\n“Basically … members of Congress set their own rules when it comes to investments and things,” said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. “There are supposed to be checks and balances in terms of the Office of Congressional Ethics in the House and the Ethics Committee, but they’re pretty limited in what they do.”\n\n“It’s an honor system in a way,” Ornstein said in an interview Friday. “You are free to buy and sell stocks and you’re supposed to be able to understand when you’re getting into conflicts of interest … When you are deeply involved in health policy like Price, and you’re making decisions every day that effect the price of stocks … it strikes me that you should be really extra careful about what you’re doing here.”\n\nCongress and the Obama administration have attempted to come to grips with the problem of the questionable trading practices of lawmakers, with mixed results. In 2012, President Obama signed into law the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act that barred members from using “any non-public information derived from the individuals’ position … or gained from performance of individual duties for personal benefit.”\n\nThe anti-insider trading legislation was enacted on the heels of a shocking 60 Minutes report in 2011 that members of Congress could legally trade stocks based on potentially market-moving information garnered as part of their duties – information that wasn’t available to the public. Correspondent Steve Kroft reported that then-Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, bet against the market in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis after receiving an “apocalyptic briefing” from then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson.\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump’s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nThe STOCK Act, signed by Obama with much fanfare, also applied to officials of the executive branch and their staffs. It greatly expanded financial disclosures and made all of the data searchable to make it easier for investigators and journalists to ferret out potential wrongdoing.\n\nBut a year later, Congress and Obama quietly watered down some of the most important provisions as part of a bill shepherded through the House by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA). The plan to automate and digitize financial disclosure forms was abandoned. Investigators now have to apply in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building for authority to print out hard copies of relevant documents.\n\nPrice joins an administration in which conflict of interest concerns are far from isolated. President-elect Trump himself appears to plan on retaining ownership of his business, which ethics experts have warned will inevitably -- and quickly -- lead to questions about whether he and his family stand to benefit from specific actions taken by his administration.\n\nRelated: GOP and Dem Governors Are Closing Ranks Against Obamacare Repeal\n\nFor example, Trump's National Security adviser, retired Army Lt. General Mike Flynn, has served on the board of a defense contractor and ran a lobbying company that had contracts with foreign government, and continued to do so even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings with Trump during the campaign.\n\nTrump's nominee for Defense Secretary, retired Marine General James Mattis, is on the board of a major defense contractor, General Dynamics, which has paid him well over $1 million in cash and stock since 2013. The new administration's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, served as a board member of an oil company joint venture between Exxon and the Russian government that has been affected by U.S. sanctions.\n\nNone of these potential conflicts are disqualifying on their own -- Trump's nominees can make a clean public break with their past commitments when they join the government. But the sheer volume of them creates the impression among critics at least that the president-elect is staffing his administration with people who have extraordinarily close ties to companies and foreign governments that will have business before the federal government.\n\nRob Garver contributed to this report."

    "text": "‘Tis the season for research reports from Wall Street economists looking ahead to 2017. And as you can imagine, the surprise victory of Donald Trump dominates most of these pages, which are filled with estimates of the impact of the president-elect’s fiscal plans on GDP growth, inflation and share prices.\n\nUnlike most, I go straight for the \"tail risk\" what-ifs to get an idea of what is in the realm of possibility. If there is any lesson from 2016 as we look ahead to the new year, it's that political uncertainty and popular anger have ushered in an era of instability and black swan events. We had Brexit and the Trump win. Fresh elections in Europe are coming next.\n\nYet one of the biggest black swans out there is the other half of Trump's political platform: A pledge to renegotiate America's trade deals, especially those with China, possibly inciting an outright trade war.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nMore than a few eyebrows have been raised by Trump's aggressive post-election behavior toward Beijing, first by his acceptance of a call from Taiwan's president and his suggestion that he may abandon the One China principle, and second by his Twitter comments in the wake of China's seizure of a U.S. Navy underwater drone.\n\nThe prospects of a standoff with China are likely higher now that Trump’s has appointed \"Death by China\" author and Harvard-trained economist Peter Navarro to head a newly created National Trade Council within the White House. The Trump transition team said the NTC would lead a \"Buy American, Hire American\" program that would boost job creation with a focus on infrastructure and defense.\n\n\"The new administration should bear in mind that with economic and trade ties between the world's two largest economies now the closest they have ever been, any move to damage the win-win relationship will only result in a loss for both sides,\" China’s official English-language newspaper said in an editorial Friday.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Threats on Trade Endanger US Jobs\n\nOf course, Trump or some of his supporters might not see the current relationship as win-win. So just what would Trump’s proposals mean for that relationship, and for the U.S. economy?\n\nDeutsche Bank researchers recently looked at a possible \"border tax adjustment\" proposal put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional Republicans and supported by Trump. Basically, the proposal would tax imports, reduce taxes and exports and be tantamount to a one-time competitive devaluation of the U.S. dollar — the type of strategy that Trump has accused China of abusing for years.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimates it would boost U.S. trade competitiveness by 15 percent instantly as imports would become 20 percent more expensive while exports would be 12 percent cheaper after taking the tax changes into account. In their view, this would be enough to almost completely close the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nThere are downsides.\n\nA border tax would likely boost inflation by increasing the cost of everyday items imported from China and elsewhere. Retailers and producers would be in a lurch: Either pass the costs onto consumers or allow profitability to be pinched. Higher inflation would encourage more rapid Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nChina would be angered. Not only would higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to strengthen the dollar — which would increase the cost of trillions in off-shore dollar-based emerging market loans — but a drop in export activity would weaken an already vulnerable Chinese economy trying to extricate itself from a bad debt problem.\n\nStill, there is hope that thanks to China's slow reduction in its reliance on the U.S. economy, Beijing will resist the urge to retaliate and instead focus on reducing factory oversupply in areas like steel and textiles in an effort to reorient its economy toward Chinese consumers and the production of higher quality, higher priced goods. As things stand now, less than 4 percent of China's GDP depends on the United States, according to Societe Generale.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nOn the other hand, China may choose to retaliate and more firmly establish its place in the global economy. The Global Times, which Reuters describes as “an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily,” responded to the choice of Navarro with an editorial that said, in part: \"China is powerful enough to withstand pressures from the Trump government. Beijing will get used to the tensions between the two countries. If Washington dares to provoke China over its core interests, Beijing won't fear setting up a showdown with the U.S., pressuring the latter to pay respect to China.\"\n\nThat’s a tail risk to watch for as we enter 2017."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/23/Trump-Doubles-Down-Threat-Nuclear-Arms-Race",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday appeared to signal that he is open to a new nuclear arms race. His soon-to-be counterpart in Russia, President Vladimir Putin, said that if one has begun, it wasn’t the Kremlin that started it.\n\nThe two statements kicked off a second day of anxious theorizing about what role the two men believe nuclear weapons will play on the international stage in coming years.\n\nRelated: Was Trump’s Nuclear Tweet a Poke at Putin?\n\nThe issue came to the public’s attention Thursday, when Putin delivered a speech to the Kremlin’s Defense Ministry Board in which he vowed to continue Russia’s massive investment in upgrading its military. He said, in part, “We need to enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems.”\n\nIt wasn’t precisely clear what he meant by “strengthening missile complexes” (language that the Kremlin provided in its own translation of the speech into English.) But the remarks could be read as a reference to an expansion of Russia’s nuclear arsenal -- something that both the U.S. and Russia have avoided doing for the most part since the Reagan administration.\n\nTrump responded with an equally vague statement, delivered on Twitter: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging, four-hour press conference on Friday, Putin returned to the topic of nuclear weapons and was asked about the possibility of reviving the arms race that defined the Cold War era. He said that if a new arms race occurs, or indeed if one has already started, it will be due to the George W. Bush administration’s decision to pull out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia in 2002.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a ‘Coup d’Etat’\n\nThe Bush administration’s controversial decision to withdraw was made, officials said, because the country needed to be able to develop an effective nuclear “shield” against attacks from rogue states that were not a party to the treaty.\n\n“When one party unilaterally withdrew from the treaty and said it was going to create an anti-nuclear umbrella, the other party has to either create a similar umbrella – the necessity of which we are not sure about, considering its questionable efficiency – or create effective ways to overcome this anti-ballistic missile system and improve its strike capabilities,” Putin said Friday.\n\nWhile Russia is upgrading its nuclear capabilities, he denied that doing so constitutes an arms race. “If anyone is unleashing an arms race, it's not us ... We will never spend resources on an arms race that we can't afford.”\n\nHe claimed that the United States is upgrading tactical nuclear weapons in several NATO countries, saying to a BBC reporter, “I hope that your program audiences and Internet users know about that.”\n\nRelated: Team Trump Is Singing from Putin’s Songbook on DNC Hacks\n\nNot long afterward, Trump delivered another statement on nuclear weapons, this time through television host Mika Brzezinski, on the MSNBC program Morning Joe. Brzezinski said that she had spoken with Trump Friday morning and that the president-elect told her he wasn’t worried about an arms race -- not because he doesn’t believe it will happen, but because he believes the U.S. would win it.\n\n“Let it be an arms race,” he told her, Brzezinski said. “We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.”\n\nLater, Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, struggled to push back against the idea that his boss was blithely inviting nuclear proliferation.\n\nHe told NBC host Matt Lauer that there won’t be an arms race, but that “other countries need to be put on notice that he is not going to sit back and allow them to undermine our safety, our sovereignty ... He is going to match other countries and take action.”\n\nWhen Lauer pointed out that matching other countries advances in weaponry is practically the definition of an arms race, Spicer again insisted that nothing like that was going to happen, because Trump “is going to ensure that other countries get the message he is not going to sit back and allow that ... What’s going to happen is they will all come to their senses and we will all be just fine.”\n\nPerhaps concerned that all the discussion about nuclear weapons was making people nervous, the Trump transition team late Friday morning, released a letter that Putin sent to Trump. Dated December 15, it offers holiday greetings and notes that “relations between Russia and the U.S. remain an important factor in ensuring security and stability of the modern world.”\n\nIt continues, “I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able—by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner—to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.”\n\nIn a brief statement, Trump called it “a very nice letter” and said, “[H]is thoughts are so correct. I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path.\""

    "text": "Republican and Democratic governors rarely see eye to eye, especially when it comes to spending on big ticket items like food stamps, unemployment insurance and other social services.\n\nBut as the Senate Finance Committee prepares for a roundtable discussion with GOP governors next month to discuss the impact of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and expanded Medicaid coverage, governors from both parties are warning of potentially disastrous consequences for state budgets if GOP leaders make good on their pledge to repeal Obamacare.\n\nRelated: Some GOP Governors Flip for Medicaid Funds -- on Their Terms\n\nNearly half of the 31 states and the District of Columbia that agreed to expand their Medicaid coverage under Obamacare are controlled by Republicans – including Vice President-elect Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana. Since the Nov. 8 election, Republican governors such as Susana Martinez of New Mexico have voiced alarm over possibly losing millions in federal funding to provide Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance coverage for seven million people.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Democratic governors sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other GOP congressional leaders warning that repeal of Obamacare would strip tens of millions of their health coverage and shift enormous health care costs to states governments – effectively “blowing a hole” in state budgets.\n\nRegardless of mounting warnings from state chief executives across the country, President-elect Donald Trump, and Republican lawmakers are almost certain to make good on their pledge to repeal Obamacare as early as next month -- but without adopting a suitable replacement for at least another two or three years.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Ryan, told The New York Times, “This disaster of a law has led to massive premium spikes, less choice for patients and a collapse of the exchange markets, and no amount of spinning from the White House can hide this ugly reality.”\n\nSome 24 million Americans potentially could be removed from the health care insurance rolls in 2021 if the GOP fails to come up with an effective alternative approach. And federal spending on health care would decline by $927 billion over the next decade, leaving it up to the states to pick up much of the slack, according to a recent study by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nRelated: Nearly Half of Obamacare Co-Ops Are Closing\n\nOne of the ironies of all of this is that while Obamacare has had an extraordinarily rocky existence from the beginning – including court challenges, internet launch woes, financial problems, mass defections by the insurance industry, and soaring premiums – enrollments for the upcoming 2017 season are moving apace at a record clip.\n\nAbout 6.4 million Americans have signed up so far for health insurance as of Wednesday, according to the Obama administration, an increase of about 400,000 over a similar point a year ago. The administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country are stepping up a campaign to try to salvage critical pieces of Obamacare, including expanded Medicaid, and the latest enrollment figures are a heartening sign to them.\n\nOf course, signing up is the first step. The real test is how many people will pay their first-month premium and stay with the plan for a year, especially when they see that premiums have risen an average 25 percent from last year and deductibles are also high.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told Times reporters Wednesday that the number of Obamacare signups was remarkable in light of “headwinds” created by the premium increases and the uncertainty over the future of the program.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that most state and local governments were still struggling to recover from the worst effects of the Great Recession, with many forced to cut back on services, raise taxes and shortchange their public employees’ retirement and health care funds.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California sent a letter this week urging her colleagues to stage events in early January to showcase Democratic support for Obamacare and Medicare, according to Morning Consult. She said the events should “highlight the risks of repeal of the ACA and ending the Medicare guarantee.”\n\nRelated: States Face a $1 Trillion Pension Problem: Here Are the Worst 10\n\nEven now, many state and local governments are unable to return to spending and personnel levels enjoyed before the economic crisis dating back to 2007 and 2008. State-run retirement systems reported shortfalls totaling $934 billion in fiscal 2014, the latest figures available, which was a slight improvement over the $969 billion deficit from the previous year, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trust.\n\nHowever, if the federal government no longer picks up the majority of expanded Medicaid coverage for poor adults in 31 states as it now does under the ACA -- most of those states would suffer massive budgetary losses to provide the health care services people now expect.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association estimated that states could face nearly $69 billion in costs for uncompensated care over the coming decade if Obamacare is repealed.\n\nRelated: States Keep Using Gimmicks to ‘Balance’ Their Budgets\n\n“This plan appears to be nothing more than a Washington, D.C. bait-and-switch that puts an untenable burden on the states,” Democratic Governors Dan Malloy of Connecticut, Jay Inslee of Washington, and Andrew Cuomo of New York wrote in the letter. “The American public has yet to see any alternative that retains coverage and financial protections for the millions of consumers currently benefitting from the ACA.”\n\nThey noted that nearly a third of those covered under the Medicaid expansion have a mental health or substance abuse disorder – an important point to make amid the nation’s shocking opioid and heroin epidemic that has claimed more than 33,000 lives in 2015 alone.\n\n“Your plan would send us back to a time when those who were sick were left uninsured or relegated to state high-risk pools with exorbitant premiums, inadequate coverage, and waiting lists,” the Democratic governors complained."

    "text": "Heading toward his inauguration in less than a month, President-elect Donald Trump has already waved a big stick at every American multinational company that’s even thinking about moving productive operations to another country. After making Carrier Co. an offer it couldn’t refuse, to keep 800 Indiana factory jobs from moving to Mexico, he warned that “companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences.” In a barrage of subsequent tweets, he threatened “retribution,” including a 35 percent tariff on products those companies try to sell back to the United States.\n\nTrump’s ultimatum scored well in national polls, but it should trouble all Americans who value free enterprise and the rule of law. It weakens our economy and our political system when the incoming chief executive of the federal government tries to dictate to U.S. companies how they should deploy their productive assets.\n\nRelated: Talk of Tariffs from Team Trump Makes Economists Very Nervous\n\nAccording to a new report issued by the U.S. Commerce Department, more than 4,000 U.S. companies operate more than 32,000 affiliates around the world. Those companies don’t invest abroad primarily to take advantage of low wages or to send products back to the homeland, but to instead reach new customers and expand their market share globally. Locating production in foreign markets allows U.S. companies to better tailor products for local consumer tastes, to reduce transportation costs and to protect trademarks and intellectual property. Various services can’t be exported; they must be delivered in the local market.\n\nIn today’s global economy, U.S. companies sell more of their brand-name goods and services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates than they do by exporting from the United States. According to the most recent numbers from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. majority-owned affiliates supplied $4.49 trillion in goods to foreign customers in 2014, compared to the $1.63 trillion exported from the United States. U.S. affiliates supplied $1.66 trillion in services to foreigners, compared to $743 billion in exported services. That means U.S. companies sell more than twice as much in global markets through their foreign affiliates as they do by exporting from the United States.\n\nWhat U.S. majority-owned affiliates produce abroad is overwhelmingly sold abroad. Of the more than $4 trillion in goods they supplied in 2014, 8 percent were sold as imports to the United States; 92 percent were sold in the host country or in third countries. A full 96 percent of the goods supplied by U.S.-owned affiliates in China were sold in that country or others outside the United States. In Mexico, 68 percent of the goods they supplied were sold in Mexico or other foreign countries.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nFord Motor Co. has also come under Trump’s Twitter fire for its plans to shift production of lower-margin vehicles to Mexico. Its competitor General Motors now sells almost twice as many cars in China than it does in the United States, not by exporting to China but by producing them in China through joint ventures. Few of the cars are exported back to the United States. In 2015, GM’s China operations returned more than $2 billion in profits, improving the company’s long-term viability after its 2009 bankruptcy.\n\nUnited Technologies Corp., the parent company of Carrier as well as Otis Elevators, operates 25 factories in China that generate $6 billion in annual sales and employ 24,000 workers. As Politico recently reported, United Technologies’ vice president for international government relations, David Manke, said of the company’s operations in China, “We’re not going anywhere. We like doing business there.” Manke said United’s joint ventures make products for the Chinese domestic market, not the U.S. market. “We don’t go there to make elevators and ship them back to the U.S. We go there to make elevators and sell them in China.”\n\nWhile investment in Mexico and China draws the president-elect’s ire, most of the foreign affiliates are located in other high-income, high-standard countries, accounting for three quarters of the affiliate value added. What attracts U.S. investment is not primarily low wages but wealthy customers, skilled workers, free movement of goods and money across borders, the rule of law and political stability. U.S. majority-owned affiliates employ twice as many workers in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia as they do in Mexico and China.\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nExpanding operations abroad not only generates profits but also supports U.S. employment at the parent company. More production abroad can increase demand for higher-end components and services exported from the United States. It creates demand for more U.S. engineers, designers, accountants and managers to support global operations. From 2009 through 2014, while U.S. multinationals were expanding their affiliate employment overseas by 3.0 million, they were adding 3.6 million jobs at their parent-company operations in the United States.\n\nThe irony of Trump’s fixation on outward manufacturing investment is that the United States remains the world’s largest recipient of manufacturing investment. Foreign multinationals, year after year, invest more than twice as much in the U.S. manufacturing sector as American manufacturing companies invest abroad. About one in six American manufacturing workers, more than 2.4 million, are employed by foreign-owned companies.\n\nWhile candidate Trump was calling out Carrier for its plans to send 1,300 jobs to Mexico, the Japanese automaker Subaru was shifting production of its new Impreza model from Japan to its operations in Indiana, adding 1,400 new jobs in the past year. We should be grateful that Japan’s government is not threatening “retribution” against its companies that “ship jobs” to the United States.\n\nRelated: There Are Still Some Big Holes in Trump’s Plan for Economic Growth\n\nIf a Trump administration succeeds in erecting a financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from investing abroad, the result will be a retreat from global markets, with European, Japanese and Chinese multinationals ready to grab market share. U.S. companies will sell fewer American-branded goods and services abroad, reducing the returns to their shareholders and employment opportunities for American workers.\n\nDaniel Griswold is a senior research fellow and co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/22/Trump-s-Nuclear-Tweet-Response-Putin",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump rattled a lot of people Thursday afternoon when, seemingly out of nowhere, he began tweeting about nuclear weapons. It was unclear whether Trump was calling for more nuclear weapons, better ones or both. As with much of what the public learns from Trump on Twitter, the 140-character limit leaves little room for nuance.\n\n“The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,” was his exact wording.\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a ‘Coup d’Etat’\n\nAt first, it appeared to simply be another example of Trump just venting whatever stray thought is passing through his head at the time, only this time with much more alarming subject matter. He had already tweeted about a vote on Israeli settlements being held at the UN today, and had subtweeted his occasional adviser Newt Gingrich, denying claims by the former Speaker of the House that the phrase “drain the swamp” was no longer approved for use by Team Trump.\n\nBut there may have been more to Trump’s tweeting about nukes than met the eye. On Wednesday night, Trump had met with several high-ranking military officers, including an Air Force general in charge of part of the nation’s nuclear weapons program. His communications team reported on Thursday that Trump had, for the second day in a row, opted not to skip the President’s Daily Brief from his national security advisers.\n\nIn today’s PDB, Trump likely heard that Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an address to the Kremlin’s Defense Ministry Board in which he declared the Russian military the strongest in the world and called for upgrading the Russian nuclear program with missiles that would defeat even the most advanced anti-missile systems. “We need to enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin.\n\nRelated: A Timeline of Trump’s Flirtation With Putin and Russia\n\nPutin made clear that the military build-up of the past few years, on which Russia has spent large amounts of its shrinking budget, is slated to continue — but that it has already had results.\n\n“Many factors, such as military factors, our history and geography and the general mood in the Russian society, allow us to say confidently that today we are stronger than any potential aggressor. I repeat, any aggressor,” Putin said. “However, if we allow ourselves to relax even for a minute, if we make a single significant mistake in modernizing the Army and the Navy and training military personnel, the situation will change very quickly, in light of the speed of global events. It can change in the wink of an eye.”\n\nRelated: Team Trump Is Singing from Putin’s Songbook on DNC Hacks\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking at the same meeting, described U.S. upgrades to nuclear forces in Europe, saying, “These actions create additional risk for Russia, and we cannot fail to respond to them.”\n\nHe added, though, “It is important to note that instead of being dragged into an arms race, the Armed Forces continue to implement the Army and Navy rearmament program adopted in 2012.”\n\nWhile it is by no means certain that Trump’s tweet on Thursday was a response to the Kremlin’s public discussion of upgrading its nuclear arsenal (and suggesting that its armed forces are superior to those of the United States), it’s as good an explanation as any for why the president-elect suddenly decided to wade into the hazardous realm of nuclear weapons policy — a place where most presidents see the need to tread with extra care.\n\nIf Trump was responding to Putin, it marks perhaps the first time that comments from the president-elect could be seen, indirectly at least, as challenging the Russian leader."

    "text": "A report from CNN that Donald Trump and his economic team are considering the imposition of a 5 percent tariff on imports is adding fuel to the fear that his administration would be willing to engage in the sort of aggressive protectionism that leads to trade wars.\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that senior figures on Trump’s economic team, like venture capitalist Wilbur Ross, the nominee for Commerce Secretary, are serious about imposing a blanket tariff on imports as they cross the border. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump took a “get tough” stance on trade issues, insisting that the U.S. is effectively being cheated out of jobs and revenue by bad trade deals.\n\nRelated: It Looks Like Trump Is Serious About Starting a Trade War With China\n\nThe suggestion that he would pursue the 5 percent tariff -- enacted by executive action, according to CNN -- came as Trump announced the creation of a National Trade Council in the White House, apparently operating at the same level and the National Security Council and Domestic Policy Council. The man he picked to run the NTC, University of California-Irvine economist Peter Navarro, is a trade hawk who has repeatedly warned that China is attempting to destroy the United States through unfair trade practices.\n\nBut while Trump has talked about tariffs before, they were typically presented as specific and punitive -- like a 45 percent tax on all Chinese goods as a punishment for what Trump claims are Beijing’s illegal trade practices, or a 35 percent tariff on goods manufactured by U.S. companies that move production overseas.\n\nAn across the board 5 percent tariff would be so unprecedented and counter to most economic theories about trade, that some economists weren’t ready to take the idea completely seriously, reacting instead with cautious disbelief.\n\nAlan Cole, an economist with the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation, said he was considering the idea a “trial balloon” that may not actually reflect the incoming administration’s real plans. “Maybe they want to see how people will react.”\n\nRelated: Experts Warn of a Coming Fiscal Crisis as Trump Prepares to Take Charge\n\nHowever, he said, “If they keep going forward with this, I would expect more attention is going to be paid to it by economists and think tanks, and that attention is going to be negative.”\n\nIn general, economists dislike tariffs because they are an inefficient form of taxation, and they cause particular problems when the nation levying the tariff is, itself, a major exporter.\n\nIf the sole purpose of a tariff was to raise money for the government, there’s at least an argument that they are a good idea. The hope, basically, is that part of the additional 5 percent cost of goods coming into the country would be borne by foreign merchants, meaning that the Treasury would gain more in tax revenue than the U.S. population would pay. However, tariffs don’t operate in a vacuum. For one, they tend to cause the currency of the country imposing them to rise in value relative to other countries’ currencies, which hurts domestic industries whose exports are now more expensive to foreign buyers.\n\nTariffs also frequently trigger retaliation by other countries, doing still more damage to domestic companies that export their goods. They also raise prices on goods that consumers in the country imposing the tariff saw as a good value.\n\nRelated: Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds? Join the Throngs and Try Canada\n\nCole said that if the Trump administration is seen to be serious about pushing the tariff, it will see “fairly united opposition among experts and academia.” However, he pointed out, the defiance of experts and academics hasn’t exactly deterred Trump in the past.\n\n“All of that opposition isn’t to say that he won’t end up getting tariffs,” Cole said.\n\nNevertheless, he said, “It’s not a good idea.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/22/Republicans-Are-Having-Second-Thoughts-About-Scrapping-Obamacare-Taxes",
    "text": "With only weeks to go before the GOP-controlled Congress begins work on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republican lawmakers and staff are struggling to address potentially catastrophic effects of killing off the program without a suitable replacement in hand.\n\nUntil now, GOP lawmakers’ biggest challenge has been to convince consumers, insurers, the hospital industry and others that the process will be gradual – perhaps taking as long as two to three years to implement – and that the 20 million or more people who obtained coverage under Obamacare and the expanded Medicaid provision will not abruptly lose their plans.\n\nRelated: Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds? Join the Throngs and Try Canada\n\nHowever, it is now dawning on the Republicans that repealing the dozen or so major Obamacare tax increases along with the premium subsidies for low and middle-income Americans would seriously crimp their effort to devise and finance a substitute health insurance program down the road.\n\nObamacare is financed by a combination of tax increases, Medicare tax increases and cost-saving measures, and other federal and state tax revenues. When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it required hospitals, the health insurance industry, medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies to share in the cost because of the huge profits they would likely accrue from millions of new paying customers.\n\nRepublican critics of Obamacare have long derided these additional taxes – especially the 2.3 percent medical devices tax, a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning services, and taxes on brand-name drugs and health insurance companies selling policies on and off the government exchanges as millstones around the necks of businesses large and small.\n\nRelated: GOP Sets the Clock for Obamacare Repeal as Health Care Groups Hit the Panic Button\n\nThey have also targeted two other Obamacare tax hikes on the earnings and investments of those making more than $250,000 a year.\n\nBut there is compelling evidence that if the Republicans go ahead next month and scrap all the taxes hikes as part of an overall repeal of the Affordable Care Act, they will not have enough revenue to finance a replacement plan.\n\nObamacare operating costs are likely to total $1.24 trillion between 2019 and 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A new Brookings Institution analysis released earlier this week estimates that only 40 percent of that total – or $496 billion – would be available to finance a Republican replacement over that same period if all the existing tax provisions were scrapped.\n\nThe Republicans could generate as much as $850 billion of the total needed through a number of budgetary and tax maneuvers, including the use of “dynamic” budget scoring to claim $200 billion of new revenues through economic expansion. There is also talk of capping the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance to pick up another $100 billion or so.\n\nRelated: 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement\n\nStill, they would fall far short of the resources they would need if they repealed all the tax hikes mandated by the ACA.\n\n“These tax cuts would make it much more difficult to achieve a sustainable replacement plan that provides meaningful coverage without increasing deficits,” wrote Loren Adler, a Brookings health policy expert, and Paul Ginsburg, a senior fellow in economic studies.\n\nMeanwhile, the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warned in another report that Senate and House GOP leaders might attempt to raid the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs to underwrite their replacement plan should Congress repeal all of the existing Obamacare taxes.\n\n“Given Republicans’ opposition to revenue increases, such as those used to fund the ACA, they most likely would turn to Medicaid and Medicare as their primary source of savings to finance a replacement measure,” the report stated.\n\nRelated: Here’s the Problem With Trump’s Plan to Sell Health Insurance Across State Lines\n\nAccording to The Hill, Republican House Ways and Means Committee members discussed the possibility of preserving some of the Obamacare taxes during a legislative retreat last week at the Library of Congress.\n\nWhile no firm decisions have been made by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), it now appears unlikely that the Republicans will seek an across the board elimination of all the taxes. Some of the Obamacare taxes could be preserved as part of a larger tax reform bill later in the year, according to the report."

    "text": "Outgoing President Barack Obama has made no secret of the fact that he thinks Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again plan to create a database of Muslims in the United States is a bad idea, but once the president-elect takes office, there won’t be anything he can do to stop him. On his way out the door, however, Obama did put an obstacle in Trump’s way.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday officially shut down the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, a leftover program put in place in 2002 following the 9/11 terror attacks a year earlier. The controversial program required males aged 16 and older who enter the U.S. from specified countries to be fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed about their plans. The program is also extended to people already living legally in the U.S. if they came from countries on the list.\n\nRelated: A Timeline of Trump’s Flirtation With Putin and Russia\n\nOf the 25 countries named in the regulation, all but one, North Korea, were majority Muslim nations, leading to charges that the rule was discriminatory. However, the system’s own flaws were its downfall. The program turned out to be expensive to implement, unwieldy in operation, and worst of all, redundant.\n\nIn 2011, after agencies had already effectively stopped enforcing some of the provisions of the system, the Obama administration officially mothballed the program, saying that modernized information systems monitoring travelers moving in and out of the country were already providing the information that the NSEERS program collected.\n\nEven though the program was no longer operational, the regulations that implemented it were still on the books in the Code of Federal Regulations. As of Friday, that will change, when a final rule by DHS is announced in the Federal Register.\n\nA draft version of the rule, already available on the Federal Register’s website, says, “The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants. DHS ceased use of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration system (NSEERS) program in 2011 after finding that the program was redundant, captured data manually that was already captured through automated systems, and no longer provided an increase in security in light of DHS’s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the United States by international terrorism. The regulatory structure pertaining to NSEERS no longer provides a discernible public benefit as the program has been rendered obsolete. Accordingly, DHS is removing the special registration program regulations.”\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Warns that Trump Is Facing a ‘Coup d’Etat’\n\nIn a statement, a DHS official added, “The intervening years have shown that NSEERS is not only obsolete but that its use would divert limited personnel and resources from more effective measures.”\n\nWhile eliminating the implementing regulations of a non-operational program may seem like a pointless exercise, it isn’t. By taking the NSEERS system completely off the books, the Obama administration is foreclosing the possibility that the Trump administration could quickly resurrect the program.\n\nNew regulations would be subject to the time-consuming notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, which could delay the implementation of a new Muslim registry indefinitely.\n\nThe notice came just a day after President-elect Trump seemed to suggest that a recent terror attack on a Christmas market in the German capital of Berlin vindicated his call, early in the campaign, for a ban on Muslims entering the country and the suggestion that creating a registry of Muslims was also possible.\n\nRelated: Why a Routine Investigation into the Russian Hack Attack Is ‘Not Good Enough’\n\n“You know my plans,” Mr. Trump said after a reporter asked him if the Berlin attack made him consider pressing ahead with a Muslim ban or registry. “All along, I’ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct.”\n\nA spokesperson later said that Trump was simply restating his plan to “suspend admission of those from countries with high terrorism rates and apply a strict vetting procedure for those seeking entry in order to protect American lives.”\n\nThe Obama administration, though, doesn’t appear to be taking any chances."

    "text": "With the Republicans’ new national agenda in a state of flux just a month before President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office, some budget and tax analysts are warning of a dimming fiscal picture that could drive up the national debt to even more troubling levels.\n\nTrump and House and Senate GOP leaders have boasted they will roll to important victories during the first nine months of 2017, including swift repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a massive tax cut for individuals and businesses, final action on a new $1.1 trillion annual budget including more funds for the military, and even initial skirmishing around efforts to cut or overhaul Medicare.\n\nRelated: Deficit Hawks Take Trump on an Ominous Tour of the Fiscal Cliff\n\nBut there is enormous uncertainty over how these historic legislative dramas will unfold next year, especially with regard to the Republicans’ timing in trying to repeal and later replace Obamacare without touching off mass panic among consumers, insurers and the health care industry. Fissures already are developing between House and Senate GOP leaders over whether Medicare reform and even changes in Social Security should be part of the health care discussion.\n\nAnd House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee Republican leaders have differing views on the size and makeup of the historic tax cut that Trump has promised Americans.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew this week blamed the Republican-controlled Congress for missing an important opportunity by resisting major tax reform, including lowering tax rates and closing loopholes, during President Obama’s second term. He cautioned the incoming Trump administration and Republican leadership against reckless tax cuts that would drain resources from domestic programs and likely drive up the debt even more.\n\n“What we can’t do is spend a lot of money having a tax cut that loses revenue because that’s just going to shift the burden somewhere else,” he told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Clinton and Trump Agree: Let’s Ignore the $19 Trillion National Debt\n\nA new analysis this week by the Brookings Institution cautions that the fiscal outlook for the U.S. “is not promising” and is “likely to get worse soon.”\n\nEchoing the warnings of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and anti-deficit groups, the new report notes that the current $11.7 trillion publicly held debt is equivalent to 77 percent of Gross Domestic Product – or the highest level relative to the economy in U.S. history, except for a few years around World War II.\n\n“Additionally, we are on the cusp of the full-on retirement of the Baby Boom generation, which will increase spending on Social Security and Medicare,” the analysis states.\n\nThe report was prepared by William G. Gale, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings and the co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and Aaron Krupkin, senior research analyst at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Why It’s Time to Worry Again About America’s Rising Federal Debt\n\nTheir findings suggest a worsening long-term debt picture than earlier projections by the CBO. They also suggest that the fiscal situation could get out of hand if Trump and the Republicans forge ahead with major tax cuts and new spending without concern about the long-term economic consequences.\n\nIn Gale and Krupkin’s latest policy projections, the publicly held debt will rise to 93 percent of GDP by 2026 and 150 percent by 2046. And that’s even if they assume the economy is near full employment the entire time, and that there are no new wars or crises that would further drain the coffers.\n\nThese projections are remarkably conservative and assume there will be no new major changes in taxes or spending – which we all know will not be the case. Trump and the House Republicans have unveiled tax plans that would slash federal revenues by $6 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively, according to Tax Policy Center and Penn-Wharton Budget Model estimates. And that’s even after accounting for the positive effects on economic growth that Trump and the GOP are claiming.\n\n“But leading Republicans have sent mixed signals about how big any tax cuts will be, with some Congressional leaders suggesting their plan will be revenue neutral. Trump claims that economic growth would reduce the cost of his plan to $2.6 trillion and that the revenue losses would be made up by spending reforms, trade, energy programs, and regulatory reform,” Gale and Krupkin wrote.\n\nRelated: As the Debt Hits $19 Trillion, Has the US Reached a Tipping Point?\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that when taken together, Trump’s tax and spending promises – including his pledge to boost military spending and make cuts in non-defense discretionary programs- would drive up the debt to 105 percent of GDP within a decade.\n\nThe CRFB report doesn’t account for the $1 trillion of new infrastructure spending that Trump promised during the campaign. By including that, the debt figures would go higher. However, they also do not account for increased economic growth and lower government spending.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) tamped down expectations last week by telling reporters he wants to avoid “a $1 trillion stimulus, according to the Associated Press. And GOP national party chair Reince Priebus, Trump’s designated new White House chief of staff, said in a radio interview that the new administration intends to focus mainly on repealing Obamacare and tax reform in the first nine months while ducking a question about infrastructure.\n\nRelated: Growing Debt Threatens US National Security: Defense Leaders\n\nThe one “silver lining” in the Brookings’ projections are low-interest rates that are keeping the debt from crowding out private investments in the economy, the report concluded. But even there, clouds are gathering on the horizon following the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to approve a minuscule hike in interest rates.\n\nThe Fed announced an increase in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points. This still leaves the U.S. with extraordinarily low-interest rates. “But historically, when the Fed has begun raising interest rates, it often follows up with a succession of rate increases,” the report stated. “Second, even if the Fed increase was undone and rates stayed constant over time, debt would still rise to about 119 percent of GDP by 2046.”"

    "text": "Be careful what you wish for, the saying goes … you just might get it.\n\nFor decades, Americans on both sides of the aisle have argued that the country needs a new, citizen-driven approach to politics. Rather than having careerists for politicians, we should have outsiders with proven track records in the private sector serve for short periods of time. If they can run a business successfully, they can make government work.\n\nThe more successful the entrepreneur, the more successful the nation will be. Belief in that theory fueled the independent bids of H. Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, and also the efforts to get Michael Bloomberg into the presidential race last year.\n\nRelated: Trump's Washington Hotel a Conflict of Interest: Democratic Lawmakers\n\nStarting in 2017, America has the opportunity to test this theory at the highest possible level of both politics and wealth. Donald Trump will take office on January 20th, and leave his long career as a real-estate developer and resort mogul behind. Or more accurately, Trump will leave some of it behind – and that’s where the problems begin.\n\nIt has become customary for presidents to put their assets into a blind trust or other hands-off financial structure after first liquidating significant assets that might present a conflict of interest. Federal law requires executive branch officials to use blind trusts, but the separation-of-powers doctrine makes the applicability to the president and vice-president questionable at best. Still, those occupying the highest office have found it politically appropriate, at the very least, to put their personal financial interests at arms’ length from their policy decisions.\n\nBarack Obama moved his assets into index funds and bonds with full disclosure in order to settle the question – but not a blind trust. In April 2010, more than a year after taking office, The Washington Post took notice on how the now-outgoing president “has rejected the approach taken by most of his predecessors in the modern era” by simply converting assets into Treasuries and widely diversified funds.\n\nRelated: Conflicts of Interest With Trump’s Businesses Are Already Occurring\n\nThe Post’s Michael Shear pointed out that then-mayor and multi-billionaire Bloomberg had not put his assets in a blind trust either. Bloomberg adviser Kenneth Gross dismissed the need for Obama to use a blind trust, arguing that his investments would have little to do with presidential policy. \"He's got his money in exactly the kinds of investments that don't require a blind trust.\"\n\nThat didn’t keep Obama free of all allegations of potential conflicts of interest. A 2011 controversy at the FCC over spectrum allocations involving a venture firm called LightSquared reached the White House when a four-star Air Force general accused Obama’s aides of pressuring him into altering Congressional testimony in favor of the firm. Three months earlier, the Huffington Post had reported that several well-connected Democratic donors and officeholders had taken stakes in LightSquared, including “Obama himself” as “an early investor” who “remains close to other early investors.”\n\nLightSquared eventually lost the fight long after the media lost the minimal interest it showed about the conflict of interest. It nonetheless demonstrates the political risks involved in refusing blind trusts. Obama’s predecessors utilized them as a ready shield against critics of their policies. And as recent coverage of the potential for conflicts between Trump’s personal finances and his responsibilities as president, the president-elect can’t count on media disinterest to shield him.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Kids Are on His Transition Team: A Serious Conflict of Interest?\n\nTrump’s good business fortune makes it more difficult to resolve those potential conflicts. Where Obama’s assets were primarily investments that could easily be liquidated or converted, Trump’s holdings are primarily real estate in an empire that remains a personal and family business. Even if Trump was inclined to liquidate, it could take years to unwind his properties in a rational manner – and he’s clearly not inclined to liquidate. Like most men and women who build personal business empires, Trump wants to pass the business along to his children.\n\nThe conflict-of-interest issue will only get amplified as a result of Trump’s Cabinet picks, most of whom are top executives at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Exxon. Wilbur Ross, Trump’s nominee as Secretary of Commerce, is a billionaire investor whose position would directly impact his portfolio. Some have already begun to notice a pattern of benefit just from being mentioned as a potential member of the next administration. Federal laws and rules would apply to these officials, which is why the Trump team has begun to look at whether discretionary blind trusts could be used to satisfy the requirements – as well as Trump’s political needs.\n\nA discretionary trust would allow Trump to retain ownership of the assets while being run by either a family member or a trusted third party. The principal benefit for Trump would be the elimination of the need to liquidate his assets, which a true blind trust would require in order to shield the president from questions about conflicts of interest. However, a discretionary trust allows the trustee to communicate with the owners about business matters, which would negate the political benefits of the trust for the Trumps – and probably fail to satisfy the legal requirements for Trump’s Cabinet to boot.\n\nRelated: Trump: Nobody but the Media Cares About Conflicts of Interest\n\nRichard Painter, who served as George W. Bush’s ethics lawyer, told Politico that a discretionary trust would be “highly inappropriate,” and leaving existing assets in place while determining policy would constitute “a violation of at least the spirit of the rules.” That might still be a problem even if his children buy him out completely. In one potential demonstration of this futility, foreign governments have already begun toadying up to Trump through his resorts. We can expect more of these efforts after the inauguration. In short, we have a mess that won’t be quickly or easily resolved.\n\nWill voters care enough about this to damage his political capital? So far it seems to have done little to dampen enthusiasm for Trump among his supporters, and a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll suggests he’ll have a honeymoon with a broader range of voters as he takes office. After all, over sixty-two million voters voted for the businessman even with the potential for these conflicts already apparent, and they may be inclined to give Trump a pass – at least until they suffer some disillusion over his governing choices.\n\nRelated: Trump’s Massive Global Business Footprint Can Subvert US National Security\n\nThat may come sooner rather than later. Trump says he wants to “drain the swamp” and make dramatic changes in the way Washington does business. That’s precisely why Trump will need to put his interests into a blind trust – to protect himself from the potential backlash. If Trump alienates enough voters and members of Congress with his policies, those conflicts of interest will offer a very handy excuse to push for impeachment under the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.\n\nVoters gave Trump the presidency – but they don’t want Trump to give them the business. Trump has to choose whether he wants to be a mogul or be a president, and he needs to make that choice now."

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/21/It-Looks-Trump-Serious-About-Starting-Trade-War-China",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump plans to create a National Trade Council within the White House, to be run by economist Peter Navarro of the University of California at Irvine.\n\nThe elevation of trade policy to the same heights as the National Security Council in the White House hierarchy appears to demonstrate Trump’s seriousness about focusing on an overhaul of the systems under which goods flow into and out of the U.S.\n\nIn a statement, the transition team said that the National Trade Council would work “collaboratively and synergistically with the National Security Council, the National Economic Council, and the Domestic Policy Council to fulfill the President’s vision of peace and prosperity through military and economic strength” and would “think strategically about the health of America’s defense industrial base and the role of trade and manufacturing in national security.”\n\nRelated: Trump's Incredibly Wealthy Cabinet: Here's How Much They're Worth\n\nFurther, the NTC will “advise the president on innovative strategies in trade negotiations, coordinate with other agencies to assess U.S. manufacturing capabilities and the defense industrial base, and help match unemployed American workers with new opportunities in the skilled manufacturing sector.” It will also oversee Trump’s promised effort to focus federal procurement dollars on U.S. companies.\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Navarro to oversee that effort is likely to cause a lot of heartburn among conservative economists. While his qualifications, including a Harvard Ph.D., are impeccable, Navarro is definitely an outlier among his fellow economists when it comes to the impact trade policy has on the economy. Like Trump, he appears to relish confrontation on trade issues, which will raise concerns about the possibility of damaging trade wars during a Trump administration.\n\nParticularly on the question of trade policy with respect to China, Navarro is a hawk’s hawk. His 2011 book, Death by China: One Job at a Time, was turned into a documentary film. A lurid poster advertising the film showed a knife inscribed “Made in China” plunged into a flag-draped United States of America with blood pouring out of it.\n\nRelated: There Are Still Some Big Holes in Trump’s Plan for Economic Growth\n\nIn September, Navarro and private equity investor Wilbur Ross, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, released a white paper defending the candidate’s economic proposals. At the heart of their argument was the assurance that Trump’s plans for a massive tax cut wouldn’t harm the federal budget because of offsetting gains from his trade policy.\n\n“In considering how to score these competing plans fiscally, it is important to note that the Trump plan generates positive and substantial tax revenue offsets from its synergistic suite of trade, regulatory, and energy policy reforms,” they wrote. “Any analysis that scores the Trump tax cuts in isolation is incomplete and highly misleading.”\n\nIn their analysis, they argued that the gains from trade could be expected to add $1.74 trillion in additional tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury over the space of 10 years.\n\nEconomists -- particularly conservative economists with a free trade bent -- were incredulous.\n\nRelated: Trump’s $1Trillion Infrastructure Plan Raises a Red Flag\n\nAn economist from the Tax Foundation called it “nonsense.” Another from the Cato Institute tweeted out the hashtag #WeAreAllDoomed. A conservative Canadian financial columnist warned a colleague not to even try reading it, predicting, “you will poke your eyes out with hot spikes.”\n\nMany economists were troubled by the paper’s apparent assertion that simply by exporting more and importing less, the U.S. GDP would grow dramatically. Experts said that prediction flies in the face of basic economic theory about what contributes to GDP growth.\n\nThe paper also advocated a far more confrontational approach to dealing with international partners such as the World Trade Organization, threatening to pull out of the organization entirely unless U.S. goods receive more favorable treatment.\n\n“Donald Trump understands that the only way to correct this unfair tax treatment is for the US to use its status as the world’s largest economy, the world’s largest consumer, and the world’s largest importer to put pressure on the WTO to change this unequal treatment,” Navarro and Ross write. “Without the US as a member, there would not be much purpose to the WTO, but prior occupants in the White House have been unwilling to lead on this issue despite its significant negative impacts.”\n\nRelated: Trump Proposes $1 Trillion for Infrastructure Without Raising Taxes\n\nAgain, trade economists were stunned at this proposal, which one described as “playing chicken with the WTO.” They argued that the idea that the U.S. could strong-arm the WTO -- a body where all decisions must be unanimous -- is fanciful.\n\nBut it’s precisely the willingness to ignore conventional thinking about trade policy that makes Navarro so attractive to Trump.\n\nThe transition team release noted, “Navarro has been instrumental in challenging the prevailing Washington orthodoxy on so-called free trade.”\n\nA statement attributed directly to Trump said, “I read one of Peter’s books on America’s trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research. He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade advisor.\"\n\nAlso in a prepared statement, Navarro said, “I am deeply honored for the opportunity to serve the President-elect and this nation and to advise on policies to rebalance our trade, rebuild our industrial base, and restore America’s comprehensive national power by making America great again.”"

    "url": "http://thefiscaltimes.com/2016/12/21/Outraged-Spiking-Drug-Prices-Congress-Tiptoes-Around-Price-Controls",
    "text": "A bipartisan Senate Aging Committee report on predatory drug pricing released on Wednesday highlights a now familiar rogue’s gallery of pharmaceutical companies --including Turing and Valeant –- that have shamelessly jacked up the prices of life-saving drugs that they exclusively control.\n\nThese companies engaged in marketing and pricing strategies worthy of the most cutthroat private equity firms, the committee found. They typically purchased decades-old, off-patent and previously affordable drugs and then abruptly raised the prices by staggering amounts. They have raked in billions in revenues at the expense of shocked consumers, insurers and government health agencies that purchase large quantities of drugs.\n\nRelated: Want to Pay Less than Half for Your Meds? Join the Throngs and Try Canada\n\nBy now it’s an old story: Turing, once headed by bad-boy hedge fund businessman Martin Shkreli, raised the price of Darprim, used in treating a dangerous parasitic infection, by 5,000 percent – from $13.50 a pill to $750 per pill. Valeant, meanwhile, spiked the prices of two off-patent drugs, Cuprimine and Syprine, used to treat a rare genetic disease, from about $500 to about $24,000 for a 30-day supply.\n\nRetrophine Inc. and Rodelis Therapeutics, the two other drug companies that came under the Senate committee’s scrutiny during a year-long investigation, engaged in similar practices and drove up the prices of some of their drugs by 2,000 percent or more.\n\nEach of the companies acquired a sole-sourced “gold standard” drug for which there is a small but desperate market. In most cases, the companies did nothing to improve on the drug or invest in further development. They also created a “closed distribution system” to block competition, while they jacked up their prices, according to the report on drug pricing.\n\nIn some instances, investors actively encouraged company executives to pursue this hard-nosed strategy despite the unwelcome attention it received from the media, politicians and even federal investigators. And some of the companies were headed by senior managers “hailing from the hedge fund world” who lacked experience in the drug industry, the report said.\n\nRelated: Prescription Drug Prices Headed for Double-Digit Increases in 2017\n\n\"The skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs affect every American family, particularly our seniors,\" Collins said in a statement. “We must work to stop the bad actors who are driving up the prices of drugs that they did nothing to develop at the expense of patients just because, as one executive essentially said, ‘because I can.’\"\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the business model of many drug companies are predatory and “immoral” for the patients and taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill. This is especially galling, she said, because generic drug substitutes can be made for pennies per dose.\n\n“We've got to find ways to increase competition for medicines and ensure that patients and their families aren't being gouged,” she said.\n\nDrug price gouging and other predatory practices have triggered angry calls for congressional action from consumer advocates, insurers, politicians and others staggering under the weight of mounting health care costs. High-cost specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year, after growing 18.9 percent in 2016, according to HR Consultancy Segal. At the same time, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Most Frequently Prescribed Drugs in America\n\nDuring the campaign, Republican President-elect Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton repeatedly raised the issue of soaring drug prices and outlined possible solutions.\n\nTrump told Time magazine recently after being chosen the “Person of the Year,” “I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”\n\nBut the nagging question is what can be done in a practical way to halt the unscrupulous drug pricing practices of the industry? And here, the Senate committee sidestepped the most obvious answer: government controls.\n\nCanada, which boasts some of the lowest drug prices in the world, pioneered federal and provincial level measures for containing drug prices, including a national drug formulary to set prices and the creation of a semi-judicial body that controls factory-gate prices. Governments across the globe impose tough limitations on drug prices, and multi-national pharmaceutical companies have learned to live with them and still thrive economically.\n\n“The problem with the Senate report is that the issue is so complicated that there are no simple solutions,” Joseph Antos, a health care expert with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview today. “If they wanted to say they did something, then this idea of essentially imposing price controls would certainly be popular with Democrats and some Republicans, especially in this space of older drugs that have a limited market.”\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\n“The risk there is that if you do that, then maybe the company that has a monopoly on that drug might say, ‘Well, it’s not worth it anymore,’” Antos added. “And then, how do you get somebody else to go in?”\n\nInstead of risking a head-on confrontation with Big PhRMA by calling for government price controls, Collins, McCaskill and other senators have urged a more back door approach. It is one that would help shake up and revitalize the market so that generic drug manufacturers would be more inclined to compete with producers of brand-name drugs.\n\nThe report provides a laundry list of ideas for spurring competition and putting heat on unscrupulous drug manufacturers like Turing and Valeant.\n\nOne approach, which already has been blessed by Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), is to remove legal barriers to the re-importation of certain drugs to this country from Canada and overseas, in order to put competitive pressure on U.S. manufacturers that currently have a lock on certain drugs. Millions of Americans have for years quietly purchased drugs from Canada and overseas to save money, and this proposal would make it legal in many cases.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nHowever, there would be numerous safety issues to deal with, including whether the government can sanction the sale of drugs in this country that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). And Trump and his campaign staff have not provided further details on the extent of their support for this idea.\n\n“The Committee believes the temporary importation may be a viable short-term solution to combat sudden price spikes,” the report states, “but notes that while this approach is favored by a number of academic professionals, many caution that are must be taken in structuring such a regime to avoid unintended consequences.”\n\nThe committee also recommended ways to speed up FDA approval of generic alternatives to high-priced brand drugs, including limiting the review process to five months and requiring manufacturers of newly introduced brand drugs to share samples of their drugs with potential rivals. That would enable generic manufactures to conduct tests on the samples to prove that their drugs are as effective as the brand name drug.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nFinally, the committee report takes a swipe at “patient assistance programs” offered by major drug companies to help low-income consumers pay for their drugs. While on the face of it, drug companies appear altruistic in offering generous rebates and discounts, these activities are self-serving because they “subsidize the purchase of their own products” and frequently steer patients towards exceedingly expensive drugs."

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk to his Strategic and Policy Forum. Musk was also invited to a special meeting with the President-elect, a Tech Summit, at Trump Tower, last week. Further piquing the media’s curiosity, Musk was said to have been invited to another, much more intimate meeting, with Trump and Apple’s CEO Tim Cook after the summit.\n\nPolitical and business observers seem to be unanimous about the significance of these moves by Trump. Firstly, Musk’s appointment to the advisory body and his participation in the Tech Summit underline the importance of Tesla, SpaceX and Musk’s solar business in the respective industries.\n\nRelated: Gas Prices Are Headed Higher for the Holidays\n\nSecondly, it looks like Donald Trump is indeed keeping an open mind on climate change, as he stated in an interview for the New York Times.\n\nThirdly, and perhaps more importantly, the move demonstrates that job creation is indeed a top priority for the future administration – Musk has a brilliant track record as an employer, having created 30,000 jobs already, 25,000 of which have been in the U.S., and planning to add another 3,000 soon to its Fremont car factory.\n\nThe implications of Musk’s appointment, however, are much more far-reaching. In fact, the attention given him by the President-elect and his transition team suggests that Trump is ready to make peace with the renewables industry despite what he said more than once about climate change on the campaign trail.\n\nThe truth, which the President-elect seems to be aware of, is that there is no going back on electric vehicles. The fact that he invited Musk to his Tech Summit is a demonstration of this awareness. Whatever Trump’s stance on fossil fuels, he seems to have realized EVs have their own place in the larger scheme of things, especially in light of his pledge to help the U.S. tech business “keep going with the incredible innovation.”\n\nRelated: Trump Family Sells Access to the President to Raise Money for Private Charity\n\nThe fact that as part of this incredible innovation Tesla’s Model 3 alone can take out 300,000 bpd of gasoline from U.S. daily demand by 2035 seems to be of no concern. First, 2035 is far in the future and second, until then the energy industry will be sure to have found a way to cope with the EV trend.\n\nThe EV revolution is being led by four companies in the U.S. – Tesla, Uber, Alphabet, and Apple. All four CEOs were at the Tech Summit. It’s unlikely that Donald Trump or his team are unaware that Alphabet just spun off its self-driving electric car project into a separate company, Waymo; that Uber is already offering ride-sharing services using EVs in London; and that Apple is working on its own EV, the iCar.\n\nThese are developments that could represent the meeting point between two of Trump’s priorities: supporting business in general and the mining industry specifically.\n\nThe EV revolution will boost demand for lithium like nothing else, whatever skeptics are saying. Government support for this revolution will make this demand boost all the greater. In short, it’s a win-win situation for all parties concerned, and the green energy lobby could allow itself a small sigh of relief that maybe Trump’s presidency will not turn the U.S. into Fossil Fuel Hell on earth.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.

    "text": "The USS Zumwalt, the stealth destroyer that was supposed to position America to reign over the high seas, is fast becoming a $7 billion bust, according to an extensive takedown in the conservative National Review Online.\n\n“The Zumwalt was going to be the United States’ 21st-century, cruiser-sized, super destroyer that would allow us to dominate the world’s oceans and littorals for the next 50 years,” writes Mike Fredenburg.\n\nRelated: The Navy Commissions Its Super Stealthy $4.4 Billion Destroyer\n\nBut, he concludes, “The Zumwalt is an unmitigated disaster. Clearly it is not a good fit as a frontline warship. With its guns neutered, its role as a primary anti-submarine-warfare asset in question, its anti-air-warfare capabilities inferior to those of our current workhorse, the Arleigh Burke–class destroyers, and its stealth not nearly as advantageous as advertised, the Zumwalt seems to be a ship without a mission.”\n\nWhat’s more, The National Review tags the Zumwalt as yet another example of military weapons systems whose scope and costs have run amok. When the program was first proposed just before the turn of the century, the Navy estimated that building 32 ships would cost about $46 billion. That’s about $65. billion in 2016 dollars.\n\nRelated: A New Navy Combat Ship Gets a Crack in Its Hull\n\nBut as costs grew, the Navy first dialed the number of ships back to 16, then seven and now three. The National Review figures that when some $10 billion in development costs is added in, the true price tag is closer to $7 billion for one ship. And the total cost is expected to rise as upgrades are added before the Zumwalt and the other two stealth destroyers are combat-ready.\n\nThe power and promise of the Zumwalt was billed as nothing short of awesome:\n\nA gun system that can accurately hit targets 70 miles away.\n\nThe ability to launch cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine rockets.\n\nA flight deck on the 610-foot, 15,000-ton ship that can accommodate F-35s and MV-22 Ospreys.\n\nRelated: From Strip Clubs to Combat Ships, McCain Blasts $13 Billion in Pentagon Waste\n\nThe National Review complains that there has been no accountability for the deficiencies or cost overruns, adding that the lead contractors -- Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics “have received additional hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of defense contracts — even as costs soared, schedules slipped, and capabilities declined.”\n\nIn November, about a month after its launch, the Zumwalt broke down in the Panama Canal: Its propellers locked and it had to be towed."

    "text": "The robots aren’t coming to take our jobs...at least not all of them. But a new report from the White House warns that unless the U.S. is smart about preparing for a future in which many, many more jobs are automated, the country runs the risk of a severely unequal distribution of the benefits from the increased efficiency that automation brings.\n\nTo a great degree, automation has already had a dramatic effect on the U.S. labor market. Political rhetoric aside, manufacturing output in the United States is at historic highs. But automation of many factory processes has made it possible to increase output with fewer workers.\n\nRelated: The Robot Revolution Could Wipe Out 5.1 Million Jobs by 2020\n\nThe report, a combined effort by the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Chief Technology Officer, says that further automation is not only going to continue, but advances in artificial intelligence (AI) make it likely that it will accelerate in coming years.\n\n“These transformations will open up new opportunities for individuals, the economy, and society, but they have the potential to disrupt the current livelihoods of millions of Americans,” the report finds.\n\nCiting a recent CEA report, the authors note, “there is growing concern about a general reduction in competition among firms for workers and a commensurate shift in the balance of bargaining power toward employers. Market concentration resulting from the development of AI has the potential to worsen these trends. A displacement of workers from industries being disrupted by AI-driven automation would also create slack in the labor market in the short to medium-run, which is likely to depress wages.”\n\nThe report calls for a strong policy response to assure that workers are able to share in the economic growth that results from increased automation. That would include strengthening the social safety net and empowering labor unions in negotiations with employers. (Both steps that would be extremely difficult to achieve in the current political environment.)\n\nRelated: Robots Muscle in on the Gig Economy\n\nOverall, the White House report advocates a three-pronged approach to preparing for a future remade by AI that includes aggressive investment in the very research and technology that is expected to disrupt the labor market.\n\n“If care is taken to responsibly maximize its development, AI will make important, positive contributions to aggregate productivity growth, and advances in AI technology hold incredible potential to help the United States stay on the cutting edge of innovation,” the report finds. “Government has an important role to play in advancing the AI field by investing in research and development.\n\nAlongside investment in research and development, the report suggests, the country should also prioritize education and training that prepares workers for a world in which simple tasks are increasing automated, making educational achievement vital to employment prospects. For example, the report estimates that more than 80 percent of jobs that currently paid an average of $20 or less per hour in 2010 are likely to be automated in the future.\n\n“As AI changes the nature of work and the skills demanded by the labor market, American workers will need to be prepared with the education and training that can help them continue to succeed,” the report finds. Delivering this education and training will require significant investments.”\n\nRelated: Will the US Unleash an Army of Killer Robots? Ask Clinton or Trump\n\nThe report calls for funding of robust educational programs from childhood on, “so that all families can prepare their students for continued education, as well as investing in graduating all students from high school college- and career-ready, and ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable post-secondary education.”\n\nFinally, the report recognizes that increasing automation will inevitably lead to disruption, particularly for low-skilled people already in the workforce. This will require, among other things, modernizing the social safety net, including unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).\n\nThe authors of the report take a hopeful stance toward the ability of public policy to address the most disruptive effects of increasing automation.\n\n“Technology is not destiny; economic incentives and public policy can play a significant role in shaping the direction and effects of technological change. Given appropriate attention and the right policy and institutional responses, advanced automation can be compatible with productivity, high levels of employment, and more broadly shared prosperity.”"

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump broke with GOP orthodoxy during the 2016 campaign by endorsing the idea of opening U.S. borders to the re-importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries as a method of bringing down health care costs and discourage price gouging by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTrump outlined his support for this move – vigorously opposed by the drug industry and the Food and Drug Administration, among others – in a seven-point health care reform plan unveiled last March. Trump also embraced another idea that was favored by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to authorize Medicare officials for the first time to negotiate with drug manufacturers to sharply reduce their prices.\n\nRelated: Prescription Drug Prices Headed for Double-Digit Increases in 2017\n\n“Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America,” the Trump campaign plan stated, in promoting market-based solutions to containing health care costs. “Allowing consumers access to imported, safe, and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.”\n\nDrug re-importation refers to the idea of importing back to the U.S. prescription drugs that were originally manufactured in this country and then exported for sale in other countries. Many U.S. drug manufacturers market their products throughout the world and negotiate different price structures in virtually every country.\n\nThe idea of lowering barriers to overseas drugs has been around for a long time, fueled by reports showing that Americans pay some of the highest prescription drug prices in the world. Countries like Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, South America and India pay far less because prices are typically dictated by the government. According to the International Federation of Health Plans, Americans pay anywhere from between two and six times what the rest of the world pays for brand name prescription drugs.\n\nFor instance, last year Gleevec, a cancer treatment drug, cost Americans and their insurers $6,214 per month for treatments, while Canadians paid only $1,141 and residents of Great Britain paid $2,697 per month, as CNN reported. It was a similar situation with Humira, a drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis that cost U.S. residents $2,246 per monthly treatment compared with $881 in Switzerland and $1,102 in England.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Most Frequently Prescribed Drugs in America\n\nA December 2015 international drug cost survey by Bloomberg concluded that prices for brand-name drugs are typically much higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries, even when factoring in the discounts and rebates that pharmaceutical companies frequently provide to insurers, government agencies such as the Veterans Administration and Medicaid. Even with discounts of as much as 50 percent to 60 percent, seven out of ten top-selling brand name drugs were still much costlier in the U.S. than overseas.\n\nThose drugs included Crestor, a pill to lower cholesterol; Lantos, a long-acting insulin; Advair, an asthma inhaler; Januvia, a pill to treat diabetes; Sovaldi, the wonder drug for treating the Hepatitis-C virus; Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug self- injector; and Herceptin, an infusion for the treatment of cancer.\n\nIn the case of Sovaldi, manufactured by Gilead Sciences in California, one pill for treating Hep-C cost $1,000 in the United States but only $4 in India, where the manufacturer agreed to lower the price in exchange for volume sales.\n\nAs the cost of prescription drugs in this country continues to mount, millions of Americans appear to be taking matters into their own hands and looking overseas for relief – even if that may require breaking the law. It has long been known that many Americans routinely purchase prescription drugs on the Internet or while traveling to Canada, Mexico or other countries.\n\nRelated: Trump Jolts the Pharmaceutical Industry with Vow to ‘Bring Down Drug Prices’\n\nPricey specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year, after growing 18.9 percent in 2016, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Meanwhile, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year, as The Fiscal Times reported recently.\n\nA new Kaiser Family Foundation national poll conducted in November found that eight percent of those interviewed said they or someone in their household had imported a drug at some point. That would be the equivalent of about 19 million adults, based on current census estimates.\n\nThose people ranged from college students in their 20s to retirees in their 80s, according to the analysis. Some purchased medication to treat high blood pressure and other chronic conditions. Others acquired the drugs to treat acute problems like sinus infections and acne.\n\nThose numbers, if accurate, indicate a major surge in the number of Americans seeking bargain-basement drug prices from neighboring countries or overseas – or at least an increase in the number of people willing to openly discuss it. Previous government surveys dating back to 2011 suggested that the share of Americans buying prescription drugs from other countries was about two percent, according to the report.\n\nRelated: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High\n\nSome people may have been reluctant to talk about their health care costs or admit that they have turned to overseas markets for better deals, according to experts.\n\nBut with Trump and some prominent Democrats and independents endorsing the idea of drug re-importation as a cost-saving measure, average Americans may feel more comfortable about admitting that they have been quietly engaging in those transactions for years.\n\nIt is illegal for individuals to import drugs into the U.S. for personal use, according to the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Customs officials. The basic argument that federal authorities use against drug re-importation is one of safety. That is because many drugs from other countries that are available for purchase by individuals here have not been formally approved by the FDA for sale in the United States – and may not be safe for use.\n\n“FDA cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs that it has not approved,” the agency says on its website.\n\nRelated: Two Big Reasons Prescription Drug Prices Are So Much Higher in the US\n\nThat’s a far-fetched argument to make in discouraging drug purchases from countries like Canada or Great Britain whose health care standards are on par with those of the United States. However, it may have more sway in arguing against buying drugs from other countries in Europe, Latin America, South America and Asia, or from acquiring drugs on through the internet.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry – which has long opposed drug re-importation because of the adverse impact it would have on its profits in this country– cites World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10 percent of medicines worldwide – and up to 50 percent of the drugs consumed in developing nations – are counterfeit.\n\n“Without proper FDA oversight and enforcement of laws designed to protect patient safety—which importation undermines— these products could infiltrate the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, with life-threatening consequences,” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug industry’s chief lobbying arm, has argued.\n\nHowever, the FDA and customs officials have not been overly aggressive in enforcing the law – although U.S. border inspectors have broad discretion in deciding whether to destroy the drugs if they are discovered at a point of entry. And the FDA says that it “typically does not object to personal imports of drugs that FDA has not approved under certain circumstances.”\n\nFor example, the FDA makes exceptions for a drug needed for a serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the United States, or in cases where there is no commercialization or promotion of the drug to U.S. residents."
