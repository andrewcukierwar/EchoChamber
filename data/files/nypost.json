Pretending otherwise, like the Japanese holdouts who refused to surrender after World War II by hiding out in the Philippines, would imperil the opportunity the GOP still has to do serious health-care reform.\n\nTo do so, Republicans should stop thinking of ObamaCare as a separate entity and focus on what aspects of the health-care system most need fixing.\n\nIt would be the right thing to do for millions stuck with spiraling health costs. And it would be politically effective, showing the country that conservatives can still govern.\n\nTake tort reform. In theory, legislation capping medical-malpractice awards should be bipartisan. In Texas, such reform \u201cproved wildly successful,\u201d according to City Journal\u2019s Kathleen Hunker.\n\nOne obstacle would be the powerful hold trial-lawyer lobbyists have over Democratic politicians. Another would be Democrats\u2019 temptation to refuse to work with Republicans on health care \u2014 at all.\n\n\u201cSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said his party is willing to discuss improvements to the law, but only if Republicans drop their seven-year-long dream of repealing it,\u201d writes Bloomberg political reporter Steven T. Dennis.\n\nSo call Schumer\u2019s bluff. And here, Republicans have more leverage than they might think.\n\nThere is no way for President Trump to undo all of ObamaCare through executive orders or regulatory adjustments. But that doesn\u2019t matter now, because he can still change a lot. And he should use that power to lure Democrats to the table on bipartisan legislation.\n\nThis was, in fact, part of the original plan. A few days after Trump\u2019s victory in November, Reuters reporter Susan Cornwell talked to GOP Sen. John Barrasso, a member of the party\u2019s leadership, about health care. Barrasso said the key would be to get an HHS secretary confirmed ASAP. Why? Repealing ObamaCare in full, he said, \u201cis not a \u2018Day One\u2019 activity. But a new secretary of HHS going after the regulations can be a \u2018Day One\u2019 activity.\u201d\n\nTime to go back to Square \u2014 er, Day \u2014 One.\n\nAt the blog The Incidental Economist, health-policy expert Adrianna McIntyre and law prof Nicholas Bagley put together a list of executive actions Trump could take to change aspects of the Affordable Care Act himself \u2014 with no need for Congress to go along. A sampling:\n\n\u201cNarrow the essential health benefits rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow [Medicaid] work requirements, premiums and more cost-sharing under\u201d Section 1115 of the Social Security Act.\n\n\u201cPermit more states to use Medicaid dollars to subsidize private exchange coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpand the reach of the contraceptive mandate accommodation (currently available to religious nonprofits and closely-held for-profit companies).\u201d\n\n\u201cDelay enforcement of the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nAnd there are others. Trump, for example, seems to like the idea of allowing for the sale of insurance policies across state lines. That may or may not be worth the trouble: The American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Joseph Antos wrote last year that ObamaCare has expanded \u201cessential health benefits\u201d to the point where \u2014 without changing Uncle Sam\u2019s interpretation of those benefits \u2014 there is less variation state to state anyway.\n\nAnd that gets to the larger point here. Republicans rightly fought ObamaCare\u2019s passage with the understanding that once a monumental reform of one-sixth of the country\u2019s economy was implemented, it would be hard to undo. Indeed, in 2013 Sen. Mitch McConnell demonstrated this by claiming, justifiably, that there had been 20,000 pages of regulations \u201cassociated\u201d with ObamaCare.\n\nThat is, the legislation itself was just the start.\n\nThe lesson, then, is that full repeal is likely a fool\u2019s game at this stage \u2014 but that the federal bureaucracy now under Trump\u2019s direction has wide latitude to interpret many areas of the law.\n\nTrump and Price can and should take advantage. It would fulfill Trump\u2019s populist message while putting Democrats on the defensive \u2014 and giving them reason to come out and negotiate broader changes.\n\nWhen the most famous Japanese holdout, Hiroo Onoda, finally surrendered nearly 30 years after WWII ended, his uniform, cap and sword were \u201call still in good condition,\u201d according to The Associated Press. Republicans can keep their uniforms clean and marinate in the denial that ObamaCare writ large is here to stay, or they can roll up their sleeves and get to work."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/video/trump-says-he-cant-make-a-mistake-then-instantly-makes-a-mistake/", "text": "0:43 Trump says he can't make a mistake, then instantly makes a mistake At a meeting with the Fraternal Order of Police, President Trump made a hilarious gaffe when he introduced a union official by the wrong name, mere seconds after remarking, \"We don't make mistakes.\"\n\n0:47 Comic book nerds fell into a pool, and looked amazing doing it Brett Stanley is an Australian-born artist who specializes in underwater photography.

This was a party-wide failure.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has \u2014 faint praise \u2014 thought more about health care policy than almost any other elected Republican. He rose to prominence with thoughtful policy proposals buttressed by PowerPoint presentations. This was his moment to shine as a wonk.\n\nInstead, with an eye to procedural constraints the legislation would face in the Senate, he wrote a mess of a bill that got failing grades from analysts across the political spectrum.\n\nThe operating theory wasn\u2019t that the merits of the bill would get it over the top, but that speed and sheer partisan muscle would. The House wanted to pass it in three weeks, which would be a rush for a bill naming a courthouse.\n\nRyan gambled that he could get his fractious caucus to rally in record time because \u2014 unlike his frustrated predecessor as speaker, John Boehner \u2014 he had a president of his own party at his back. And none other than \u201cthe closer,\u201d President Trump, whose calling card is his skill at deal-making.\n\nBut you can\u2019t be a closer if you don\u2019t know anything about the product. Trump knew the health care bill was wonderful and beautiful and his other characteristic boosterish adjectives. Otherwise, he was at sea.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough to engage in meaningful negotiations. One of his interventions \u2014 to try to placate House conservatives by stripping out the so-called \u201cessential health benefits\u201d of ObamaCare \u2014 may have lost more moderates than it gained votes on the right.\n\nFor their part, Ryan and Trump are united in blaming the House Freedom Caucus, the recalcitrant group of conservatives that destroyed Boehner\u2019s speakership and have made a good start at ruining Ryan\u2019s.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is certainly prone to self-defeating purity, but in this case, when they said the bill wouldn\u2019t fully repeal ObamaCare or do enough to reduce premiums, they were correct. The bill shed support on both the right and the left because of its underlying weakness (it\u2019s hard to get anyone to back a bill with a 17 percent approval rating, per a Quinnipiac poll).\n\nPerhaps most unforgivably, the White House and congressional Republicans now have decided to move on. After seven years of promising to repeal and replace ObamaCare \u2014 with Trump thundering it at rallies and Republicans writing it into every campaign document \u2014 they\u2019re giving up after three lackluster weeks.\n\nTax reform beckons. Republicans tell themselves they\u2019ll get better results on taxes because it\u2019s more natural terrain for the party, an implicit concession that the GOP still \u2014 even after electing a populist president \u2014 can\u2019t bring itself to engage on kitchen-table issues that don\u2019t involve tax cuts.\n\nPerhaps the initial tax legislation will start in a better place, the process will be more deliberate and Trump will get immersed more readily in something \u2014 the tax code \u2014 central to his business dealings.\n\nBut tax reform is more popular in theory than it is in practice. It requires painful tradeoffs and is vulnerable to the political critique that it favors the wealthy and corporations over working people. Already there are divisions between House and Senate Republicans over the so-called border adjustment tax that Ryan and his team favor.\n\nIf tax reform is going to pass and get signed into law, Republicans will have to perform much better than in the foreshortened health care debate. On the bright side, they can\u2019t perform much worse."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/03/27/schumer-demands-nunes-be-replaced-as-house-intel-committee-chair/", "text": "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer demanded Monday that Rep.

I put the MAGA hat on the wooden table behind the bar that I was standing by.\n\nMoments later, a couple of drunk-seeming bros caught sight of the offending merchandise.\n\nWasting no time at all, they asked whether they could have it. Since it wasn\u2019t mine, I said I\u2019d sell it, not thinking they\u2019d bite.\n\nHow much?

You want the hat? Two hundred bucks.\u201d\n\nNow two bros were battling over the hat and their wallets \u2014 flipping through wads of hundreds eventually throwing down a Benjamin and two fifties before snatching the coveted hat.\n\nMy girlfriend briefly snapchatted the exchange to commemorate the moment in which a hat that goes for $3 on Ebay is being bought for $200 at a trendy Manhattan bar.\n\nLife seems pretty OK in Trump\u2019s economy, I thought.\n\nCue the ego: the instant the hat is placed on one of their heads, both bros begin to exude Alpha, prompting the return of management and giant Eddie, again pleading with them to take off the hat.\n\nThe guys mouth off, and I hear one of them say, \u201cHe\u2019s our president.

If the proposal falters, it will be a political debacle that could poison President Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress.\n\nThat relationship is awkward and tenuous. It\u2019s an uneasy accommodation between a GOP Congress that would find a more natural partner in a President Rubio, Cruz or Bush, and a President Trump who would, presumably, be happier to work with Speaker Dave Brat \u2014 the populist congressman from Virginia \u2014 than with Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nThis is a product of how the Republican sweep of 2016 was won on separate tracks. Trump tore up many Republican orthodoxies and went out and found a different way to unlock the electoral map, winning in the industrial Midwest.\n\nCongressional Republicans more or less stuck with the usual script, kept Trump at arm\u2019s length and held their majorities in the House and the Senate.\n\nAs a result, there\u2019s no significant Trumpist wing in Congress. The faction most favorable to him, the House Freedom Caucus, is made up of ideological conservatives whose philosophy is at odds with Trump\u2019s economic populism, if not his anti-establishmentarianism.\n\nAnd there was no off-the-shelf Trump legislation Congress could begin on right away. In the campaign, Trump identified a constituency and a message, but the agenda was often symbolic (Mexico will pay for the wall) or nebulous (better trade deals).\n\nThe natural reflex, then, was to defer to the Republican leadership in Congress. Trump could\u2019ve come roaring out of the gate with one of his distinctive proposals, the $1 trillion infrastructure plan, and wooed Democrats to support it and dared Republicans to oppose it. Instead, that\u2019s been put off to the second year, and may not happen at all.\n\nThe congressional priorities are ObamaCare repeal and tax reform, both of which could easily have been the first-year agenda items of the aforementioned Presidents Bush, Rubio or Cruz. They\u2019ll have to be passed without Democratic votes and through the Senate reconciliation process that circumvents the filibuster.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump promised to deliver on both, but neither was part of his core message or won over marginal Trump voters.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s in the interest of Congress and Trump to make the shotgun marriage work. The speaker is pursuing repeal and replace simultaneously because that was Trump\u2019s preference, and the president has been supportive of Ryan\u2019s bill while maintaining flexibility.\n\nThis is sustainable so long as things go smoothly; the test is when things don\u2019t. House leadership is counting on Trump to help get its bill over the top, but at the same time it realizes he may seek an off-ramp as soon as it looks like leadership is failing.\n\nIf the bill falters in the House, it will be the most fraught moment of GOP tension since the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Except the question won\u2019t be whether congressmen and senators dump Trump, but whether Trump dumps them.\n\nEven more than most politicians, Trump has no interest in owning failure. The explanation of the president and his supporters won\u2019t be that he backed a flawed strategy and bill in the House and paid the price. It will be that he was stabbed in the back. He went along with a GOP establishment politics that doesn\u2019t understand or care about Trump voters, and he can never make that mistake again.\n\nThere\u2019s almost no question that Trump would win any blame game. He would have the larger megaphone, the more intense supporters and much sharper elbows. He could instantly define Paul Ryan as a creature of the Washington swamp and decide to triangulate away from the GOP Congress rather than work with it.\n\nThis would mean Trump would be a president not without a party necessarily, but without a Congress. It would make major legislative accomplishments impossible, although if ObamaCare repeal-and-replace fails, that might be the reality regardless.\n\nSome skeptics of the Ryan bill hope that its defeat will allow the party to quickly move on to tax reform. But that won\u2019t be easier. It, too, is highly complex, involves painful trade-offs and will disappoint populists, since the Republican template cuts taxes for the rich without much thought about working-class voters.\n\nIt\u2019s better for everyone if ObamaCare repeal-and-replace succeeds.

Some of it is the divisiveness of social or cultural issues like abortion and gay marriage. And the divide has seemingly sapped Democrats\u2019 ability to communicate to religious Americans.\n\nEspecially if those people of faith are white, according to Brad Chism, a longtime and respected Democratic strategist based in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cAnd that problem extends to the national media, who by and large are mostly Democrats, meaning you have these powerful forces who do not understand more than half of the people in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nChism makes a crucial point about what this means for American politics: Some of the greatest moral advancements in our country\u2019s history have been accomplished largely through the influence of the church and churchgoing people, especially through the 20th century.\n\n\u201cYou look at women\u2019s suffrage, civil rights, the abolition of slavery and all of these massive other changes \u2014 religion and religious people have played a role in moving society toward a higher plane,\u201d said Chism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that recently as well, but a lot of progressives and liberal Democrats don\u2019t see the role of religion in society, and that is a big mistake,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a mistake people like Kevin Washo are trying to rectify, though they feel like they\u2019re swimming against the tide. A day before the Democratic National Convention opened here last July, Washo, a Catholic and prominent national Democrat, organized a private Mass led by a Jesuit priest in the conference room of a prestigious law firm in a shimmering Market Street skyscraper.\n\nThat imagery is a far cry from the 2012 Democratic convention, when the hall exploded in turmoil as Democrats voted to amend their party\u2019s platform to include the word \u201cGod.\u201d The platform initially had dropped previous platform language that referenced God. After an outcry, convention chairman Antonio Villaraigosa returned to the stage to take a floor vote on a motion to reinsert the language.\n\nThe floor vote quite clearly failed as Villaraigosa repeated the roll call. Eventually he declared that \u201cthe ayes have it,\u201d and loud boos exploded across the arena.\n\nThe headlines that came out of that debacle \u2014 \u201cDemocrats boo God\u201d was a common one \u2014 ended up making matters worse for those, like Washo and Chism, who would like to see their party counter the perception of its estrangement from people of faith.\n\nWasho, a former executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, wants the national party to recognize this problem and invest heavily in solving it: \u201cOne of the first things I think they need is full-time engagement at the DNC to focus on people of faith, not just for a cycle, but make something permanent within the party with real resources.\u201d\n\nWasho said the messaging also needs to be sincere to people of faith \u2014 \u201ca real, authentic effort, not lip service.\u201d\n\nThe 2006 midterm elections seem to have been a turning point. Democrats won control of both the House and the Senate as well as a majority of state governorships. As the Pew Research Center noted at the time, exit polls showed Democrats \u201cdid well among their core constituencies; compared to 2002, they received increased support from Jews, the religiously unaffiliated, infrequent churchgoers and those who never attend religious services.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Democrats were hugely successful across the country by solidifying their base. In the process, they have pushed away religious voters not simply by ignoring them but by actively repelling them with accusations of bigotry and backwardness.\n\nUnless they change that, Democrats \u00adhaven\u2019t got a prayer of solving their God problem."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/03/14/bannon-i-dont-know-if-we-would-have-made-it-without-kellyanne/", "text": "Donald Trump owes his presidency to then-campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, claims White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon.\n\nBannon believes Conway\u2019s \u201crelentless advocacy\u201d for Trump after the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d scandal before last November\u2019s general election carried the now-president over the finish line, he said in an interview with The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIf Kellyanne had not been there when the firestorm hit, I don\u2019t know if we would have made it,\u201d Bannon said.\n\n\u201cShe literally became a cult figure during that time period, just because of her relentless advocacy for Trump on TV.\u201d\n\nConway isn\u2019t just relentless, she is tough, too, Bannon added. \u201cShe can stand in the breach and take incoming all day long. \u2026 That\u2019s something you can\u2019t coach,\u201d he said.\n\nLikewise, pollster Frank Luntz credits Conway for Trump\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cHe owes her for standing up for him,\u201d said Luntz of Conway\u2019s advocacy for the presidential candidate after the recording of Trump claiming to grope women because he\u2019s a \u201cstar\u201d came out. \u201cI could not have done what she did.\u201d\n\nLuntz added, \u201cI would not have survived it; I\u2019m impressed that she did. \u2026 In every possible sense, she won.

This one\u2019s not a happy story.\n\n\u201cSweat\u201d is about a factory town at the beginning of the 21st century. But it\u2019s far more relevant for New Yorkers than residents here might think. And they should see it so as to have more empathy for people who voted for President Trump.\n\nPlaywright Lynn Nottage\u2019s setting may be as far away to many New Yorkers as Hamilton\u2019s 18th century. It\u2019s the year 2000, and factory workers in Reading, Pa., are nursing their millennial New Year\u2019s hangovers. The economy is humming along nicely, and few people are interested in the presidential election.\n\nBut there are bad signs: One factory locked out its manufacturing workers 93 weeks ago. Another factory, where the three middle-aged women at the center of the story work, is looking to cut costs.\n\nOne worker puzzles over what NAFTA is. A friend tells her that it means that owners can cart their shop floor down to Mexico, piece by piece, where laborers will work for a fraction of the wage.\n\nAnother character tells others the ominous rumors he\u2019s heard about automation. He notes that their bosses think they can run the huge place with \u201cfive and a half people\u201d at the push of a button.\n\nOther than that, Sweat doesn\u2019t really get into economics. Instead, it\u2019s what happens to real people who see their lives upended. (It\u2019s clear from the first scene that things won\u2019t unfold well.)\n\nCan a factory worker stay friends with the recently promoted manager who helps kill her job? (Probably not.)\n\nAs the bad news comes, people don\u2019t take it in a bloodlessly rational manner, as Democrats and Republicans from the pre-Trump era might have expected. Nobody wants to re-train as a nurse. People already grappling with the regrets of aging are angry that nobody important considers them to be worth much.\n\nPeople with no jobs drink more and lash out at each other. A man embarrassed to depend on his wife for money turns to drugs.\n\nSeveral people resent the colleague who tries to make the best of a bad situation by planning to go to college, chastising him as thinking he\u2019s better than they are. Older characters can\u2019t decide if they want their kids to suffer like they do, or to leave, becoming the kind of people they can\u2019t relate to.\n\nThe characters aren\u2019t virtuous martyrs. They\u2019re given a bad hand \u2014 and make bad decisions with it.\n\n\u201cSweat\u201d is good at showing how racial tensions that may exist in the background during good times come to the surface when things go south. The son of an Hispanic immigrant is tolerated when he does the work that Americans don\u2019t want to do. When he expresses interest in a non-union job at a factory fighting with the union, he becomes a threat.\n\nBlack people and white people can be collegial when both are making money. When neither of them is, both sides see racial favoritism and prejudice.\n\nIndeed, on the race issue, theater can do what panel discussions cannot. Many New Yorkers still dismiss Trump voters as unabashed racists. What they don\u2019t see is the desperation. If you\u2019re drowning, you may not wonder whether the person who says he\u2019s going to rescue you is a racist.\n\n\u201cSweat\u201d ends in 2008, with President George W. Bush begging Congress to bail out Wall Street. (The play wisely skips over 9/11; Broadway shows that treat the attacks have a history of failure.)\n\nNottage finished writing the play before the 2016 election. In fact, it premiered in Oregon a month after Trump announced his candidacy in 2015.

Feminists, so proud of their Women\u2019s March signs that are now being collected by the Smithsonian, have now returned to everyone\u2019s favorite vehicle for ideological sloganeering: the T-shirt.\n\n\u201cStrong like Mom,\u201d reads a new boys\u2019 T-shirt out from Target this week, and feminist moms everywhere are gushing about the garment. At The Huffington Post, Emily McCombs notes, \u201cThe T-shirt is a breath of fresh air for parents amidst the gender normative \u2018trucks for boys, ponies for girls\u2019 aesthetics we usually see in children\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nRachel Garlinghouse at the website Babble is so excited about the new \u201cStrong like Mom\u201d shirt because, \u201cIn the past, if I saw a tee complimenting my kid in any way, chances are it was complimenting their looks . . . And typically, any comparisons to Mom or Dad were paired by gender (girls were \u2018pretty\u2019 like Mommy, and boys were \u2018handsome\u2019 like Daddy).\u201d\n\nShe is right. There are a lot of T-shirts that engage in gender stereotyping. But the alternative to making your kid wear a shirt that supports the patriarchy isn\u2019t making them wear shirts that push feminism. It\u2019s making your kids wear shirts that don\u2019t have slogans.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: People are not billboards.\n\nWe regularly tell our children not to judge a book by its cover, but with these covers how could you not?\n\nAmerican consumers appear to have the opposite view. The \u201cStrong like Mom\u201d tees have been selling like hotcakes, and almost every children\u2019s clothing store appears to sell something that will turn a kid into a feminist signpost. Abercrombie & Fitch has \u201cGirls Won\u2019t Quit,\u201d \u201cLead the Pack,\u201d and \u201cHear My Roar.\u201d Children\u2019s Place has a large selection of girl-power shirts, including \u201cNever Underestimate the Power of a Girl\u201d and \u201cGirls Will Change the World.\u201d\n\nMessage T-shirts have been a thing for decades, but ever since Hillary Clinton ran for president and moms took their daughters to the polls, every other girl in the greater New York area seems to own a female empowerment top.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cI\u2019m with Her\u201d T-shirts, there is now the official Elizabeth Warren \u201cNevertheless She Persisted\u201d in youth sizes.\n\nLiberal parents use their children as a form of \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d \u2014 saying \u201cLook, we\u2019re from a \u2018good\u2019 family that voted for the nice lady.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump voters outside the NYC bubble are buying baby onesies blaring the legend: \u201cProud Deplorable,\u201d a pacifier bearing Trump\u2019s face and bibs that urge us all to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThis message clothing trend is another symptom of how every aspect of our society is now seen through a political lens. A baby doesn\u2019t even know what a feminist or a deplorable is, but Mother has declared it one.\n\nAnd yet, slogan clothes are part of the larger problem, which is the general need to project a superficial image with a tee. Tween clothing store Justice is selling shirts that say, \u201cMy room was clean but then I had to decide what to wear.\u201d In recent weeks, I\u2019ve seen adolescents wearing a shirt that says \u201cSarcastic Comment Loading\u201d and another that says, \u201cOMG. No one cares.\u201d\n\nWe regularly tell our children not to judge a book by its cover, but with these covers how could you not?\n\nMaybe their friends will find them witty and clever as a result of seeing them in these shirts. But just as many peers will probably find them annoying. While some adults will cheer on kids with these slogans \u2014 assuming that their parents are the \u201cright\u201d sort of people \u2014 many will wonder why these children need to advertise their political positions and bad attitudes on 100% cotton.\n\nWe want our kids to get to know others, to ask questions and have conversations with those they may not know well. We also want people to assess our children based on the things they say and the way they act, not how they dress.\n\nMaybe it is just safer or easier for kids to demonstrate their views and attitudes on their shirts rather than articulating them to others. In which case we are also making matters worse \u2014 in a world where kids can\u2019t look up from their screens, we are helping them avoid real conversations.\n\nImagine the future generations who want to see the archives of American history. They will find the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Declaration of Sentiments, Letters from Birmingham Jail . . . and a bunch of ratty girl power T-shirts and MAGA hats.\n\nIf the medium is the message, folks, our modern messages are sorely lacking."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/03/03/cuomos-ridiculous-leave-it-to-the-prosecutors-plan-for-preventing-corruption/", "text": "Gov.

Only 4 percent of Americans think Obamacare works well the way it is. And here\u2019s the best statistic of all for Trump personally: Thirty-eight percent of Americans say they like him personally regardless of whether they like or dislike his policies.\n\nAll of this suggests that Americans are giving Trump a chance, and that they\u2019re tired of the media failing to do so. They think Trump is going to bring change, and they want to allow him freedom to pursue that change. Democrats and members of the media who keep saying that Trump can\u2019t be trusted with the tiller of government ought to have an easy solution: Give him all the leeway he wants, and then watch him pursue policies they think are unpopular. By acting as foils for Trump, the media and the left actually prop him up \u2014 they allow him to position them as obstacles to making change.\n\nTrump is in control.

Of course. Would they give a standing ovation to an infrastructure program that would\u2019ve had them scowling in disapproval if President Obama had proposed it? Yeah, why not? Would they enthusiastically greet talk of paid family leave and investments in women\u2019s health? By all means, sign them up.\n\nTrump\u2019s ecstatic reception from the right over the past week is testament to the power that a president has over his own side in our politics and the sheer gratitude and relief of the GOP rank and file that Trump, against all expectations, vanquished the House of Clinton.\n\nSomething more fundamental is going on, though. We are witnessing the end of Reaganism, and among the very people who were supposed to be most supportive of it. This doesn\u2019t mean Trump and Congress won\u2019t pursue conservative policies \u2014 tax cuts, a defense buildup and deregulation all have a distinctly Reaganite ring \u2014 but the defining commitment of Reaganism to cutting the size of government is clearly fading.\n\nIf this commitment was always easier to enunciate than to effect, the aspiration was nonetheless important. Neither Ronald Reagan nor Newt Gingrich succeeded in paring government, but they slowed its growth. Limited-government conservatism represented at least something of a brake on the expansion of a welfare state, trying to say \u201cno\u201d when it is easier to say \u201cyes,\u201d calling for \u201cless\u201d when the natural tilt is toward \u201cmore.\u201d\n\nFor decades, if the average panelist at CPAC was asked what united the right, he would naturally have answered limited government \u2014 fiscal conservatives supported it for obvious reasons; social conservatives favored it because they feared the liberal impositions of an overweening state; even national-security conservatives could see the nation\u2019s struggle during the Cold War as a fight against nuclear-armed collectivism.\n\nThis year, Steve Bannon answered differently. He posited that nationalism unites the right, and that limited-government conservatives are just one element of the broader coalition. This view encapsulates the change wrought by Trump \u2014 in part because Reaganism had become so stale.\n\nThe conventional Republicans in the 2016 race hewed to Reaganism as a creed frozen in amber circa 1981. They were too rigid, too insular and too nostalgic. They were beaten by someone who was none of those things. (Trump was nostalgic, but not for the Reaganism of the 1980s.)\n\nTrump took his heterodox mix of policies, won the election in November and then could show up at CPAC and in Congress \u2014 both venues where he was largely disdained 12 months ago \u2014 and bask in the adulation of eager Republican converts to Trumpism.\n\nThis Trumpism is still a work in progress. As expressed in his speech to Congress, it\u2019s a somewhat awkward jumble of populism (the dominant strand, with its emphasis on protectionism and immigration restrictionism), conventional GOP priorities (tax cuts, deregulation, etc.) and Ivanka-ism (family leave, women\u2019s health).\n\nThe only thing that doesn\u2019t fit is limited government. Trump wants both guns and butter, a military buildup and nation-building at home. He isn\u2019t overly concerned with how to pay for this, or for his tax cut. Social Security and Medicare, an enormous swath of the budget, appear to be off limits. The risk is that Trump may give us the rhetoric of Andrew Jackson with the fiscal discipline of LBJ.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Republican majorities in Congress, notionally full of budget hawks, will impose more fiscal restraint on the president than he is inclined to impose on himself. And the staying power of Trump\u2019s reorientation of the right will depend much on the success or failure of his administration. Perhaps Reaganism, one way or the other, will emerge again, although, for now, its former guardians and enthusiasts have fallen hard for something else."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/de-blasio-keeps-giving-staten-island-the-cold-shoulder/", "text": "Mayor de Blasio has spent 2017 staying far away from Staten Island.\n\nBy the end of this week, Hizzoner will have left the Big Apple and jet-setted across the country more times in the past nine days than he\u2019s gone to the \u201cforgotten borough\u201d all year, a report says.\n\nOn Sunday \u2014 instead of going to the Staten Island St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade \u2014 he is skipping it for a fourth straight year and flying to California for a fundraiser in Los Angeles, according to the Staten Island Advance.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to attend due to scheduling conflicts,\u201d de Blasio spokeswoman Jessica Ramos said of the March 5 parade.\n\nThe mayor has been practically living out of his suitcase since last weekend \u2014 traveling to Atlanta for the Democratic National Committee meeting to elect a new party chair and then to Washington D.C. to attend the US Conference of Mayors.\n\nOn Thursday, de Blasio returned to the city \u2014 and then headed to Chicago to speak to the City Club of Chicago on Friday attend a fundraiser there..\n\nHis next stop will be in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Saturday for the keynote address at the Broward Democratic Party\u2019s annual fundraising dinner, before he eventually heads to California on Sunday.\n\nIn comparison, the mayor has visited Staten Island a total of three times this year \u2014 and none of the appearances were public, the Advance reports.\n\nThey included a dinner at Aunt Butchie\u2019s of Brooklyn in Richmond Valley with Borough President James Oddo on Jan. 25; a meal at Lee\u2019s Tavern in Dongan Hills, also with Oddo, on Feb. 9; and a fundraiser for his reelection bid sometime in January.\n\nDe Blasio chose to once again skip the borough\u2019s popular Groundhog Day ceremony at the Staten Island Zoo last month \u2014 three years after the notorious \u201cCharlotte\u201d controversy in 2014.\n\nThe mayor has boycotted the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade every year since being elected, on account of it prohibiting gays from marching openly with banners.\n\nStaten Island is considered the most conservative and isolated part of the city, and residents there often complain they live in the forgotten borough.\n\nIn 1993, residents were so upset that they overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to secede from New York City and create a city of their own.

Initially, they create anxiety and doubt among their targets, but unless they can expand interest in their cause, they lose steam.\n\nAnnie says she doesn\u2019t think Democratic Party leaders \u201ctruly understand the visual contrast they created on Tuesday, because they are viewing it from a bubble, and they seem to forget that Democrat voters, who want to be supportive, live outside the bubble.\u201d\n\nFor now, anyway."}, {"url": "http://pagesix.com/2017/03/01/widow-of-joe-bidens-deceased-son-having-affair-with-brother-in-law-hunter/", "text": "The widow of Joe Biden\u2019s late son Beau Biden has started a romantic relationship with Beau\u2019s brother Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s younger son.\n\nHallie was devastated when her husband, Beau, died after suffering from brain cancer in May 2015.

Trump haters interpreted the line as an incendiary call to decimate the federal government, when \u201cthe administrative state\u201d was a more specific reference to a federal bureaucracy that operates free of the normal checks of democratic accountability.\n\nThe administrative state has been called \u201cthe fourth branch\u201d of government. It involves an alphabet soup of executive agencies that wield legislative, executive and judicial powers and thus run outside of and counter to our constitutional system. The agencies write \u201crules\u201d that are laws in all but name, then enforce them and adjudicate violations.\n\nBoston University law professor Gary Lawson describes how this works in the case of, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission:\n\n\u201cThe Commission promulgates substantive rules of conduct. The Commission then considers whether to authorize investigations into whether the Commission\u2019s rules have been violated. If the Commission authorizes an investigation, the investigation is conducted by the Commission, which reports its findings to the Commission.\n\n\u201cIf the Commission thinks that the Commission\u2019s findings warrant an enforcement action, the Commission issues a complaint. The Commission\u2019s complaint that a Commission rule has been violated is then prosecuted by the Commission and adjudicated by the Commission.\u201d\n\nWelcome to government by commission.\n\nJames Madison called such an undifferentiated accumulation of powers, which the Constitution is meant to avoid, \u201cthe very definition of tyranny.\u201d In his epic scholarship on the administrative state, Philip Hamburger argues that it\u2019s \u201ca version of absolute power.\u201d\n\nConstitutional law arose, Hamburger writes, to check the prerogative power of the British crown, and now the federal bureaucracy is replicating that prerogative power in extralegal practices.\n\nIf progressives in the Trump years were truly concerned with reaffirming democratic accountability, they\u2019d be delighted with a prospective deconstruction of the administrative state. But they built it and rely on it.\n\nA century-old ideological project, its roots are in the Progressive Era, and it grew apace during the development of the New Deal and Great Society. The idea was to circumvent the frustrations of constitutional government, with all its natural obstacles to action, and to institute rule by experts.\n\nThe administrative state is the friend of anyone hoping to aggrandize government. President Barack Obama would have been hobbled without it. He used it to institute sweeping new regulatory regimes on carbon emissions and the internet. He imposed his preferred social policies on schools and universities through \u201cDear colleague\u201d letters issued by middling bureaucrats.\n\nThe administrative state was exactly what he needed \u2014 a way to govern without Congress.\n\nHostility to the administrative state isn\u2019t necessarily natural for Trump, who isn\u2019t a limited-government conservative or a constitutional purist. Yet he campaigned against regulation, he scorns the elite and federal bureaucrats have already made clear their desire to frustrate his plans. Dethroning the administrative state fits into a populist program to restore power to the people through their elected representatives.\n\nIt\u2019s chiefly Congress that needs to reassert itself. It has delegated its legislative powers over the decades, and needs to pull them back. As Adam White writes in an essay for City Journal, it should pass the REINS Act to require congressional approval for major new regulations. It should revisit laws like the Clean Air Act and Communications Act of 1934 that give regulators too much leeway. It should limit the deference that courts give to administrative agencies.\n\nNone of this is the stuff of fire-and-brimstone, but rather the mundane work of slowly lurching the wheels of the federal government back onto a constitutional track. Something as entrenched as the administrative state won\u2019t be \u201cdeconstructed\u201d in one presidential term, or two. If it can be dialed back, though, it\u2019ll be a significant victory for old-fashioned representative government."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/27/taking-trump-serious-on-making-the-gop-the-workers-party/", "text": "At great moments in history, generals have seen before them their enemies, undefended, unaware, lying in their grasp. And when that happens, they pray, \u201cO God, I thank Thee that Thou has delivered my enemy into my hands.\u201d\n\nSuch a moment has now arrived in American politics, and President Trump has recognized it. He sees a helpless, confused Democratic Party and he\u2019s about to outflank them. He\u2019s stealing their issues, and we\u2019re about to witness a revolution in American politics on a par with President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China.\n\nTrump signaled this in his CPAC speech last week when he said he wants to go after regular American workers. Until now, Republicans didn\u2019t know how to reach them.\n\nThe Democrats were the workers\u2019 party, the party that blue-collar types naturally thought of as their home. That\u2019s what Trump is disputing. He wants American workers to think they\u2019re naturally Republicans.\n\nSo what would a Republican workers\u2019 party look like? For starters, it would win elections, unlike other models that come to mind. The Wall Street party. The white-shoe party. The WASP party.\n\nApart from cultural differences with an older GOP, a Republican workers\u2019 party would have to jettison some of its substantive policies and beliefs. Take private-sector unions. Republicans have been the right-to-work party, and that\u2019s fine. But they\u2019ve also communicated a deep anti-union hostility.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was happy to see Alex Acosta nominated as labor secretary, after the anti-union Andrew Puzder backed out. No one would say Acosta, the dean of Florida International Law School, is the enemy of unions. He has served on the National Labor Relations Board and has the distinction of being backed by both the Federalist Society and union leader Richard Trumka.\n\nWhat Trump understands is what the founder of the American Federation of Labor, Samuel Gompers, understood: The worst crime against working people is a company that fails to operate at a profit.\n\nGompers hated socialists, and he also opposed immigration laws that took jobs from the working class. He would\u2019ve loved Trump.\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal Trump offers the Democrats: You can try to protect public-sector unions. We\u2019ll protect America\u2019s private-sector workers, unionized and nonunionized.\n\nRepublican outreach to private-sector union members is something 19th-century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli would have applauded. As the Conservative leader, he backed the 1867 Reform Bill that extended the franchise to all adult male heads of households.\n\nThat was something you\u2019d have expected Whigs in the British Liberal party to propose, but it came from the Conservatives, and it was said that Disraeli had \u201cdished the Whigs.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump seeks to do is to dish the Dems. We may see another part of the strategy unveiled during Tuesday night\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, this time over health care. Republicans on the Hill have said they simply want to repeal ObamaCare, without necessarily replacing it.\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible idea, because it would leave many millions of Americans in the lurch, and so Trump has insisted that there will be no repeal without a replacement.\n\nBut then what kind of a replacement should we expect to see on Tuesday night? I\u2019m guessing, but what Trump has said is that he wants all Americans to have health insurance. We know that he doesn\u2019t want to cut Medicare. Perhaps we\u2019ll see it expanded.\n\nDoes that sound like we\u2019re headed toward single-payer health care, Canadian-style? Maybe, but then recall that somehow Canada beats the pants off us on measures of economic freedom from all the right-wing think tanks.\n\nWe\u2019d also need private insurance markets on top of that, for Cadillac treatment. But for what it\u2019s worth, my experience with Canadian Medicare wasn\u2019t so terrible.\n\nA few years back, my mother passed away in Toronto, at 104 years old. And in the last six months of her life, she\u2019d be in the hospital once a month for a slip-and-fall. They\u2019d take her to the hospital, check that nothing was broken, and then tell her they\u2019d like to keep her around a bit to check out her kidneys. In the last six months of her life, she spent one week a month in the hospital on long-term care issues. At 104.\n\nTrump\u2019s message to Democrats: We\u2019ll take care of jobs and health care.

Does this mean that \u201cbig government\u201d is not really big? And that by doing much more with not many more employees it has accomplished prodigies of per-worker productivity? John J. Dilulio Jr., of the University of Pennsylvania and the Brookings Institution, says: Hardly.\n\nIn his 2014 book \u201cBring Back the Bureaucrats,\u201d he argued that because the public is, at least philosophically, against \u201cbig government,\u201d government has prudently become stealthy about how it becomes ever bigger. In a new Brookings paper, he demonstrates that government expands by indirection, using three kinds of \u201cadministrative proxies\u201d \u2014 state and local government, for-profit businesses, and nonprofit organizations.\n\nSince 1960, the number of state and local government employees has tripled to more than 18 million, a growth driven by federal money: Between the early 1960s and early 2010s, the inflation-adjusted value of federal grants for the states increased more than tenfold. For example, the EPA has fewer than 20,000 employees, but 90 percent of EPA programs are completely administered by thousands of state government employees, largely funded by Washington.\n\nA quarter of the federal budget is administered by the fewer than 5,000 employees of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \u2014 and by the states, at least half of whose administrative costs are paid by CMS. Various federal crime and homeland security bills help fund local police departments. \u201cBy conservative estimates,\u201d Dilulio writes, \u201cthere are about 3 million state and local government workers\u201d \u2014 about 50 percent more than the number of federal workers \u2014 \u201cfunded via federal grants and contracts.\u201d\n\nThen there are for-profit contractors, used, Dilulio says, \u201cby every federal department, bureau and agency.\u201d\n\nFor almost a decade, the Defense Department\u2019s full-time equivalent of 700,000 to 800,000 civilian workers were supplemented by the full-time equivalent of 620,000 to 770,000 for-profit contract employees. \u201cDuring the first Gulf War in 1991,\u201d Dilulio says, \u201cAmerican soldiers outnumbered private contractors in the region by about 60-to-1; but, by 2006, there were nearly as many private contractors as soldiers in Iraq \u2014 about 100,000 contract employees, not counting subcontractor employees, versus 140,000 troops.\u201d Today, the government spends more (about $350 billion) on defense contractors than on all official federal bureaucrats ($250 billion).\n\nFinally, \u201cemployment in the tax-exempt or independent sector more than doubled between 1977 and 2012 to more than 11 million.\u201d Approximately a third of the revenues to nonprofits (e.g., Planned Parenthood) flow in one way or another from government. \u201cIf,\u201d Dilulio calculates, \u201conly one-fifth of the 11 million nonprofit sector employees owe their jobs to federal or intergovernmental grant, contract or fee funding, that\u2019s 2.2 million workers\u201d \u2014 slightly more than the official federal workforce.\n\nTo which add the estimated 7.5 million for-profit contractors. Plus the conservative estimate of 3 million federally funded employees of state and local governments. To this total of more than 12 million, add the approximately 2 million actual federal employees. This 14 million is about 10 million more than the estimated 4 million federal employees and contractors during the Eisenhower administration.\n\nSo, today\u2019s government is indeed big (3.5 times bigger than five and a half decades ago), but dispersed to disguise its size. This government is, Dilulio says, \u201cboth debt-financed and proxy-administered.\u201d It spends more just on Medicare benefits than on the official federal civilian workforce, and this is just a fraction of the de facto federal workforce.\n\nMany Americans are rhetorically conservative but behaviorally liberal. So, they are given government that is not limited but over-leveraged \u2014 debt-financed, meaning partially paid for by future generations \u2014 and administered by proxies. The government/for-profit contractor/non-profit complex consumes 40 percent of GDP.

And that\u2019s not the only case.\n\nTrump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a man known not just for his intellect and integrity but also for his powerful legal argument against \u00adexecutive-branch overreach. Based on his previous legal writings, if Gorsuch had his way, the federal bureaucracy could well face the most dramatic check on its authority since the early days of the New Deal.\n\nTrump nominated H. R. McMaster to replace Michael Flynn as his national-security adviser. McMaster made his name on battlefields in the Gulf War and the Iraq War, but he made his name as a scholar by writing a book, \u201cDereliction of Duty,\u201d that strongly condemned Vietnam-era generals for simply rolling over in the face of Johnson-administration blunders and excesses.\n\nIn his view, military leaders owe their civilian commander in chief honest and courageous counsel \u2014 even when a president may not want to hear their words.\n\nIn his view, military leaders owe their civilian commander in chief honest and courageous counsel \u2014 even when a president may not want to hear their words. When the Ninth Circuit blocked Trump\u2019s immigration executive order (which was certainly an aggressive assertion of presidential power), he responded differently from the Obama administration when it faced similar judicial setbacks.\n\nRather than race to the Supreme Court in the attempt to expand presidential authority, it told the Ninth Circuit that it intends to rewrite the order to address the most serious judicial concerns and roll back its scope.\n\nAuthoritarianism is defined by how a president exercises power, not by the rightness of his goals.\n\nIndeed, if you peel back the layer of leftist critiques of Trump\u2019s early actions and hires, they contain a surprising amount of alarmism over the rollback of governmental power.\n\nEducation activists are terrified that Betsy DeVos will take children out of government schools or roll back government mandates regarding campus sexual-assault tribunals. Environmentalists are terrified that Scott Pruitt will make the EPA less activist.\n\nCivil-rights lawyers are alarmed at the notion that Jeff Sessions will inject the federal government into fewer state and local disputes over everything from school bathrooms to police traffic stops.\n\nA president is \u201cauthoritarian\u201d not when he\u2019s angry or impulsive or incompetent or tweets too much. He\u2019s authoritarian when he seeks to expand his own power beyond constitutional limits. In this regard, the Obama administration, was truly one of our more authoritarian.\n\nObama exercised his so-called prosecutorial discretion not just to waive compliance with laws passed by Congress but also to create entirely new immigration programs.\n\nHe sought to roll back First Amendment protections for political speech (through his relentless attacks on Citizens United), tried to force nuns to facilitate access to birth control and even tried to inject federal agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into the pastor-selection process, a move blocked by a unanimous Supreme Court.\n\nIn foreign policy, he waged war without congressional approval and circumvented the Constitution\u2019s treaty provisions to strike a dreadful deal with Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Trump has expressed on occasion authoritarian desires or instincts. In the campaign, he expressed his own hostility for the First Amendment, his own love of expansive government eminent-domain takings (even to benefit private corporations), encouraged violent responses against protesters and declared that he alone would fix our nation\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nBut so far, not only has an authoritarian presidency not materialized, it\u2019s nowhere on the horizon.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s facing a press that has (and somewhat cynically) rediscovered its desire to \u201cspeak truth to power,\u201d an invigorated, activist judiciary and a protest movement that\u2019s jamming congressional town halls from coast to coast.

The petite brunette wrinkles her nose as she glances at the headlines from the Washington Post, New York Times and USA Today. \u201cIt\u2019s just so different from our local newspaper,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019s right. The Bedford Gazette and Altoona Mirror, sitting in stacks alongside the \u201cbig guys,\u201d make no mention of the latest outrages concerning President Trump. Which isn\u2019t to say those stories aren\u2019t important, but it points to one undervalued aspect of the country\u2019s alienation from national media.\n\nLocal and state governments often function as intermediary institutions that can be more responsive to local needs than the federal government. Local newspapers long performed a similar role. But for areas of the country where local papers have been left behind, the void is palpable.\n\nThe Bedford Gazette is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Pennsylvania, dating back to 1805. Its circulation is now 9,000 in a county of 49,000. It, like other area papers \u2014 the Altoona Mirror, Somerset Daily American and the Erie Times-News \u2014 has lost circulation, though none of the papers would give me the exact figure. (Some appear to have lost about half of their peak circulation.) Other competitors are long gone.\n\nOn a day last week when the Page 1 story in the national papers was Trump\u2019s rambling and combative press conference, the Bedford Gazette ran with three local stories above the fold and a piece on Sen. Pat Toomey holding a town-hall meeting two counties over. Both are legitimate and interesting coverage choices. But they should complement each other.\n\nUsed to be that you consumed your news from a local reporter who lived in your community and covered events from a perspective you recognized. Today, as more and more local newspapers die, that relationship has evaporated.\n\nAnd folks are going to be less trusting of a reporter who works and lives in a cosmopolitan culture that has no connection with them. There\u2019s no social consequence or contract because reporters and readers don\u2019t have much in common.\n\nAnd politics reflects the culture, so pols increasingly retreat to the \u201csafe spaces\u201d of their preferred national media organizations.\n\nFloyd Macheska, a small-business owner in West Newton, Pa., says the problem is all relative to your experiences. \u201cWe do not share a unified space between ourselves and the media. They do not trust us because they cannot understand why we voted for Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIn turn, we do not trust them to treat him with fairness. Or us, for that matter.\u201d\n\nMacheska likes Trump. He admits he is rough and not very strategic, \u201cbut that is what we voted for,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is never going to make the Washington press corps very happy, or people who do communications for a living, that\u2019s just the facts.\u201d\n\nThe way he sees it, if the press would just dispassionately report on Trump and keep him honest, the balance would return. \u201cIf the press fundamentally thinks there is something actionable he is going to do to them, like curtail the rights of the press, then for goodness sakes investigate that.\u201d But they\u2019re exhausted by the perpetual outrage.\n\nAll of which makes a key point: Coverage of Trump is often treated as a proxy for how the press thinks of Trump\u2019s supporters. That might be unfair to national reporters chasing down a controversial president. But the disconnect is exacerbated by the fact that far too many Americans don\u2019t have a local press that understands them, and thus all their news comes with a heap of condescension.\n\nReporters don\u2019t like it when these voters talk down \u201cthe media,\u201d as if they\u2019re all part of one monolithic blob. But to those who used to have local news and reporters who lived among them, that\u2019s precisely what the national press is.\n\nReporters, then, must invert the classic environmentalist trope of \u201cThink globally, act locally.\u201d At the very least, to bridge the yawning trust gap, journalists \u2014 even those who act globally \u2014 should think locally."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/23/if-trump-doesnt-start-leading-congress-itll-get-nothing-done/", "text": "President Trump gives the impression of having done everything in his first month in the White House \u2014 except think about Congress.\n\nA couple of months ago, there were congressional Republicans reluctantly on the Trump train who would\u2019ve welcomed such neglect.

He\u2019d \u201csign our stuff,\u201d as some put it, but otherwise leave them alone.\n\nThis turned out to be wholly mistaken. First, it underestimated Trump\u2019s ability to establish air, sea and land dominance in the nation\u2019s political conversation to the exclusion of all other GOP voices. Second, it failed to appreciate how necessary presidential leadership is to getting anything done on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt this rate, congressional Republicans won\u2019t send the president anything significant to sign, let alone set the agenda.\n\nTrump has totally eclipsed congressional Republicans with a flurry of executive orders, Twitter outrages, White House meetings and all-around melodrama that drive the political debate hour by hour. Watching cable news, you could be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that there is a co-equal branch of government called Congress, except insofar as its members are forced to react to whatever Trump is saying or doing.\n\nTrump has created a sense of action bordering on headlong momentum through the sheer force of his frenetic personality.\n\nSome of the motion is significant. He nominated to the Supreme Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, who will get confirmed and represent an enduring achievement.

This isn\u2019t part of the job that Trump has yet embraced, or shown much awareness of. But it\u2019s not proving a boon to his party\u2019s legislators.\n\nCongress is naturally fractious and insular, and left to its own devices will often spin its wheels or make shortsighted decisions. The foray out of the box by House Republicans this year was going to be the elimination of Congress\u2019 own independent-ethics office. The next step after that was going to be to repeal ObamaCare without a replacement.\n\nNeither was a good idea, and each reflected greater concern for internal congressional dynamics than political reality. Trump, correctly, dissented from both moves.\n\nThat Congress listened \u2014 backing off on abolishing the ethics office and now moving toward simultaneously repealing and replacing ObamaCare \u2014 suggests the enormous sway Trump has. Yes, his approval ratings are historically low for a new president and distinctly middling for a president at any point.\n\nYet his hold on the GOP base is formidable, and his core supporters are nothing if not vociferous. Couple that with his prodigious media megaphone, and Trump could break isolated senators or members of Congress resisting his congressional agenda like a twig.\n\nIf, that is, he has such an agenda.\n\nNo one knows what his infrastructure plan is. Or what he wants on the ObamaCare replacement, which will badly divide Republicans (one reason that Republican leaders hoped to sidestep it). Or where he comes down on the contentious issue threatening the ultimate passage of tax reform, the border-adjustment tax that House Republicans support but faces stiff opposition in the Senate.\n\nThese aren\u2019t details, but core questions that must be resolved if Trump is going to have a successful first year legislatively. It\u2019s not time to panic. Trump could address all of this in his speech to the joint session of Congress next week. And the wheels are turning on Capitol Hill, especially in the House. But every day that passes means Republicans have lost a little momentum and risk losing the political window for major changes.\n\nIf Trump turns out simply not to have any interest in legislation, it likely won\u2019t augur a period of strong congressional governance, but of drift and perhaps outright failure.

And the ad, shot in Spain, Morocco and Thailand and filled with scenes of people of different nationalities helping each other during encounters around the world, might be taken as a prescription for a populace continuing to grapple with issues of culture and race as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigrants present in the U.S.\n\nThe themes for Hyatt\u2019s spot were in place well before the recent U.S. election, said Maryam Banikarim, Hyatt\u2019s chief marketing officer, in an interview.

The ads usually provide a tension-free counterpoint by playing up the glamour and luxury that are so much a part of the event. Just as Fox\u2019s recent broadcast of Super Bowl LI featured ads that touched upon themes that struck more of a chord for an audience viewing them through the prism of recent politics, so too might ABC\u2019s telecast of the event.\n\nNew York Times Co., a first-time Oscars advertiser, will highlight the need for truthful, independent reporting in a chaotic time.

ABC sought at least $2 million for a 30-second ad in the event, according to media buyers and other people familiar with the tone of negotiations, and even pressed for as much as $2.5 million in some talks. The average price in 2016 hovered around $1.72 million, according to Kantar, a tracker of ad spending, compared with $1.31 million in recession-wracked 2009.\n\n\u201cLive TV is still a place that brings communities together,\u201d said Banikarim.

We are counting on you to hold your ground.\u201d Perhaps Takei is unaware that former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \u201cnuked\u201d the filibuster for most of the president\u2019s nominees. Presumably imagining the Democrats would never again be out of power, Reid did away with the rule that required 60 votes for federal judicial nominees and executive-office appointments.\n\nLast Monday, when national security adviser Michael Flynn tendered his resignation, the smugness reached worrying \u2014 but also unintentionally humorous \u2014 levels. A first scalp from the Trump administration in their hands, many were eager to tie as many Republicans as possible to Flynn\u2019s collapse.\n\nActress Justine Bateman tweeted, \u201cAll the Republican Senators who confirmed Flynn must feel pretty comfortable right now. Excellent homework, Senators.\u201d Novelist and teacher Mark Sarvas tweeted, \u201cLet us pause to consider the utterly amoral GOP senators who confirmed Flynn. Go look up \u2018advise\u2019 when you have a second.\u201d\n\nSick burn, guys. Except, of course, for the fact that Flynn\u2019s position doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation.\n\nFollowing Flynn\u2019s resignation, Michael Moore took to Facebook to accuse President Trump of somehow rigging the election with the help of the Russians and demanded that both Trump and Pence resign. Running into the same \u201cPresident Ryan\u201d trap as Kohn, Moore then demanded that \u201cthe court\u201d (presumably the US Supreme Court) \u201chas to rule either that the president is the winner of the popular vote OR the election must be held over.\u201d\n\nEven if Moore\u2019s outlandish accusations were true, there is no \u201cdo-over\u201d in American presidential elections (this isn\u2019t touch football at recess), and there is no such thing as a national popular vote.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, of course. The bigger problem with this widespread lack of knowledge is that it leads to scary places. Is Kohn really that blas\u00e9 about a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d? Does Moore really not care that our entire political system would be in jeopardy if \u201cthe court\u201d did what he asked?\n\nAre people really willing to throw away the American political framework because a candidate they don\u2019t like won an election?\n\nI didn\u2019t vote for Trump, but for all the concern that Trump is going to destroy America, the lack of faith and lack of support for our extremely successful democracy is what\u2019s most worrisome. Thanks to the separation of powers, Trump can only do so much (shout-out to my second-grade teacher, Ms. Benson).\n\nWhen comedian Sarah Silverman daydreamed on Twitter, \u201cONCE THE MILITARY IS W US FASCISTS GET OVERTHROWN. MAD KING & HIS HANDLERS GO BYE BYE,\u201d does she understand that she\u2019s calling for a banana republic-style military coup in a constitutional democracy?\n\nWriting in New York magazine last week, the always-excitable Andrew Sullivan noted that we have become \u201cless free\u201d because Trump has become such an all-encompassing obsession for many people. But perhaps Trump shouldn\u2019t be an all-encompassing obsession \u2014 you can feel free to take occasional breaks from politics, and in fact much of the country does. It\u2019s easy for political journalists to fall into the trap of assuming everyone\u2019s as obsessed with every word the president utters as you are.\n\nYet neither should you ignore politics altogether. You\u2019ll notice an uptick in your faith in America if you pay attention to how much we\u2019ve survived.\n\nAnd then you can hopefully give Sally Kohn & Co. a few history lessons."}, {"url": "http://pagesix.com/2017/02/19/macdella-cooper-running-for-president-of-liberia/", "text": "MacDella Cooper \u2014 the humanitarian best known for having children with married men, including Dick Parsons of Citigroup fame \u2014 is running for president in her native Liberia.\n\nA fundraiser for the philanthropist will be held March 9 at the Park Avenue home of Greek Cypriot financier Roys Poyiadjis and his wife, Donna.

Paul Sracic, a political science professor at Youngstown (Ohio) State University, explains that Trump \u201ccould have lost Florida and still won, something the last Republican president, George W. Bush, never could have done.\u201d\n\nThat outcome led Republicans to gleefully declare they had broken down the supposedly impregnable \u201cblue wall\u201d of electoral votes that was expected to guarantee Democratic presidential victories forever. As Sracic said, \u201cAll four of these states voted for Barack Obama twice.\u201d\n\nYou might not expect illegal immigration to be a pressing concern in the states bordering the Great Lakes, about as far north of Mexico as you can get and still remain in the United States, Sracic points out: \u201cThe percentage of the population made up of illegal immigrants in each of these four states ranges from a low of 0.9 percent in Ohio to a high of 1.8 percent in Indiana.\u201d Compare that to Nevada and Texas, where the numbers are 7.2 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.\n\nBut that\u2019s the problem. The 14th Amendment requires that, in apportioning congressional representatives based on population, we count the \u201cwhole number of persons in each state.\u201d The Supreme Court affirmed that method of counting last year in Evenwell v. Abbott.\n\nSo illegal immigrants are essentially represented in Congress alongside legal citizens, because the Census counts both.\n\nSince the Census is the determining factor in the number of House seats allocated to each state, those states with large numbers of illegal immigrants get extra seats (and more power to determine appropriations, electoral votes, etc.) at the expense of others.\n\nStates like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThree of the four states that swung to Trump in the Upper Midwest lost seats in 2012, after the 2010 Census was taken,\u201d Sracic said. Ohio lost two; Michigan and Pennsylvania, one each. \u201cMeanwhile, Texas gained a whopping four seats, while Nevada gained one.\u201d\n\nRight now, Ohio is projected to lose another congressional seat following the 2020 Census.\n\nTo be fair, other factors (climate, jobs, taxes, etc.) contribute to population shifts. But Sracic cites an American University study that found, \u201cIf only citizens were counted when apportioning House seats, Michigan and Pennsylvania would each see their one seat restored and Ohio would get back one of the two seats it lost after 2010.\u201d\n\nUsing that same methodology, California would lose five seats and Texas two seats.\n\nAnother way of saying all this is that three of the four Upper Midwest states that swung to Trump in 2016 would gain political power \u2014 electoral votes, too \u2014 if the number of illegal immigrants were reduced or not counted for census purposes in states such as Texas.\n\nFor years, rural and Rust Belt America have seen their numbers, power and influence in Washington wane. Pennsylvania had 36 House seats in 1933, twice the number it holds today; Nevada had only one at-large seat back then.\n\nWhen most people discuss the impact of illegal immigration, they generally become agitated over security risks and job losses. They rarely consider how population shifts occurring hundreds of miles away can dramatically alter political bases, alliances and power among the states.\n\nCandidate Trump turned illegal immigration into a winning issue in November and, as president, he hinted at expanding the issue by claiming that illegal voting unfairly tipped the popular vote against him.\n\nIf he or his supporters, in and out of politics, build on the issue by pointing to the impact on congressional representation, they could ignite entirely new passions in the states most hurt by it \u2014 the ones that helped him win, and that he hopes will help him keep, the White House."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/15/offing-andy-puzder-will-likely-only-feed-democrats-blood-lust/", "text": "Democrats looking for a cabinet-level Team Trump scalp finally got one Wednesday, as Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for secretary of labor.

Rubio\u2019s remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday after the \u201csilencing\u201d of Sen. Liz Warren.\n\nOne of the great traditions of our nation is the ability to come forward and have debates. But the founders and the framers and those who established the US Senate and guided it for over two centuries understood that debate was impossible if matters became personal.\n\nI don\u2019t know of a single nation in the history of the world that has been able to solve its problems when half the people in a country absolutely hate the other half.\n\nI was not here when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state. But I can tell you I am just barely old enough to know that some very nasty things have been written and said about Secretary Clinton. And I think the Senate should be very proud that during her nomination, to my recollection, not a single one of those horrible things that have been written or said about her were ever uttered on the floor of the Senate.\n\nI happen to remember in 2004 when then-Sen. John Kerry ran for president. Some pretty strong things were written and said about him. I was here for the vote when he was nominated and confirmed to be secretary of state. And I don\u2019t recall a single statement being written into the record about the things that have been said about him.\n\nAnd I want everybody to understand at the end of the night, this isn\u2019t a partisan issue.\n\nTurn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where people throw chairs at each other, and punches, and ask yourself: How does that make you feel about those countries? It doesn\u2019t give you a lot of confidence in them.\n\nNow I\u2019m not arguing that we\u2019re anywhere near that here, but we\u2019re flirting with it. We have become a society incapable of having debates anymore.\n\nIn this country, if you watch the big policy debates, no one ever stops to say, \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong, I understand your point of view \u2014 I get it. You have some valid points, but let me tell you why I think my view is better.\u201d I don\u2019t hear that anymore.\n\nHere\u2019s what I hear, almost automatically, from both sides of these debates. As soon as you offer an idea, the other side jumps and says, \u201cThe reason why you say that is because you say you don\u2019t care about poor people, because you only care about rich people, because you\u2019re this, or you\u2019re that.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m just telling you, we are reaching a point in this republic where we\u2019re not going to be able to solve the simplest of issues.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to say that I\u2019m not, from time to time in heated debates outside this forum, guilty of hyperbole and comments I\u2019m not proud of. But I have to tell you I think what\u2019s at stake here is the ability of the most important nation on earth to debate, in a productive and respectful way, the pressing issues before us.\n\nOne thing you learn about US senators is whether you agree with them or not, you understand why every single one of those other 99 people are here. Because they are intelligent people, they are smart people, they are hardworking people, they believe in what they are saying, and they articulate it in a very passionate and effective way.\n\nAnd when my colleagues stand up and say something I don\u2019t agree with, I try to tell myself, \u201cI don\u2019t agree but I know why they\u2019re doing it; because they represent people who believe that.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m so grateful that God has allowed me to be born and to live and to raise my family in a nation where people with such different points of view are able to debate those things in a way that doesn\u2019t lead to war, that doesn\u2019t lead to violence. You may take that for granted. Right now, all around the world, there are people who if they stood up here and said the things that we say about the president or others in authority, they\u2019d go to jail.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t ever take that for granted. And the linchpin of our free debate is this institution.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake if the Senate ceases to work, if we reach a point where it becomes acceptable to say just about anything about anyone. For I have seen over the last year and a half things said about people, about issues, about institutions in our republic, that I never thought I would see.\n\nIf we lose this body\u2019s ability to conduct debate in a dignified manner, then where in this country is that going to happen?

The end of the commercial shows two wooden doors in the wall through which a mother and daughter enter America.\n\nIt was hard to miss the point of the ad, though CEO Maggie Hardy Magerko \u2014 a supporter of President Trump who praised the proposed border wall \u2014 says it\u2019s being misconstrued. Either way, the ad was clearly political in nature.\n\nMore concerning is the emerging witch hunt on the left that won\u2019t allow companies to stay out of politics in the Age of Trump. Before his inauguration, Trump thanked Linda Bean, the granddaughter of L.L. Bean\u2019s founder who sits on the board of the popular Maine clothing company, for her campaign support. That was enough to earn her a spot on a growing liberal black list.\n\nThe company put out a statement saying Linda\u2019s personal politics were just that \u2014 personal. \u201cBut Shannon Coulter, one of the founders of [anti-Trump boycott organizer] Grab Your Wallet, told the Bangor, Maine, Daily News that the company would remain on the boycott list until Linda Bean is removed from the board,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nIt was, even to some on the left, a head-scratcher. L.L. Bean, wrote Slate\u2019s L.V.

It has donated millions of dollars to conservationist and educational causes.\u201d\n\nNot good enough, apparently.\n\nThen, more recently, there was ride-sharing company Uber.\n\nAfter Trump signed an executive order heavily restricting immigration, especially from Muslim countries, protests broke out at JFK Airport, where refugees and green card holders were left in limbo. City taxis called a work stoppage. Uber\u2019s drivers, who can make individual choices and set their own hours, kept working.\n\nThat led to the #DeleteUber movement, a call to boycott the company for refusing to get in line.

The president has used policy debates on trade to single out companies like Carrier and General Motors, and used his Twitter feed to praise companies like L.L. Bean and Ford. And this week, he took the opposite tack: After word spread that Nordstrom was dropping daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line due to flagging sales, Trump reprimanded the company on Twitter.\n\nBusinesses say they want a \u201cTrump strategy,\u201d but it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nEveryone these days is a potential target, whether they\u2019re a growing building materials company, a clothing retailer or an entertainer like Lady Gaga who decided that no politics \u2014 just pure entertainment mixed with a subtle nostalgia for Americana \u2014 was more appropriate for the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see a focus by the media and a response by the general public away from these kinds of damaging outrages and more of how we generally address the problems facing the country,\u201d said Elizabeth, a 30-something mother and working professional who lives here in Eighty-Four.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she want to give her last name? \u201cDo you see what they do to people, or companies, these days?\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have anyone knocking on my door or posting on my Facebook page when they read this.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/09/slamming-the-supremes-like-fdr-and-abe-lincoln/", "text": "As you might have heard, President Trump tweeted at a judge.\n\nThe commentariat shuddered at the effrontery of it, some worried that the foundations of the separation of powers had been shaken and even Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch reportedly said he was disheartened.\n\nTrump\u2019s slam of Judge James Robart was undeniably crude and ill-considered, but it wasn\u2019t a threat to our republic.\n\nIn fact, it is a symptom of our distorted and overly sanctified view of the judiciary that a criticism of a judge with a lifetime appointment is greeted with such pearl clutching. It is entirely appropriate that the political branches have their own view of the law and the Constitution and robustly contest \u2014 and even deny the legitimacy of \u2014 court decisions that they consider erroneous.\n\nTrump will have to go considerably further to come close to Andrew Jackson supposedly saying of a Supreme Court decision protecting the Cherokee Indians in Georgia, \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\u201d Or to match the wars waged on uncongenial Supreme Court decisions by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of Robart, who blocked Trump\u2019s travel ban, as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d was needlessly insulting and counterproductive. That said, Trump is fully within his rights, indeed it should be his responsibility, to defend the legal and constitutional prerogatives of the presidency as he sees them.\n\nLincoln quoted Andrew Jackson for what should be the unassailable proposition that, \u201cEach public officer, who takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.\u201d\n\nIn a notorious fireside chat in 1937, FDR described the American government as a three-horse team, pulled by Congress, the executive and the courts. Guess who was falling down on the job by striking down New Deal legislation? \u201cTwo of the horses are pulling in unison today; the third is not.\u201d FDR proposed his court-packing scheme as the remedy (to get \u201cnew and younger blood\u201d on the court, you understand).\n\nIf FDR\u2019s court gambit is a blot on his record, Lincoln\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott decision redounds to his great credit.\n\nTo say that Republicans weren\u2019t deferential to the ruling is an understatement for the ages. They alleged a vast conspiracy of Chief Justice Roger Taney and top Democrats to commit offenses \u201ccomparable to the worst villainies of recorded history,\u201d in the words of one historian.\n\nEveryone would soon enough recognize Dred Scott as a disgrace. At the time, though, supporters of the decision considered it a means to peacefully settle a question tearing the country apart.\n\nLincoln allowed that Dred Scott applied to the particular parties to the case; he refused, though, to accept it \u201cas a political rule.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Lincoln venting during an idle moment in his bathrobe. As Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, has written, \u201cLincoln\u2019s answer to the problem of judicial authority was a hesitant, at first moderate, at times inconsistent, but increasingly radical and complete repudiation of the idea of judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation.\u201d\n\nLincoln devoted a portion of his first inaugural to developing his argument. \u201cIf the policy of the government upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, \u201cthe people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\u201d Lincoln and the wartime Republican Congress proceeded to govern as if the Dred Scott decision didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd disconnect that Lincoln is justly considered perhaps the greatest statesman in the history of our country, yet his rejection of judicial supremacy that was so central to his view of our system is roundly ignored \u2014 as it is by Democrats who\u2019ve made opposition to Citizen\u2019s United a long-term cause.\n\nThe fundamental point is that it is not just the executive or Congress that can abuse its power and overstep its bounds. The courts can, too, and no one is obligated to meekly accept their decisions.\n\nThursday, a 9th Circuit panel upheld the temporary stay of Trump\u2019s travel ban. If the courts in the end throw out the order, despite the black-and-white letter of the law giving him the authority to block aliens in the interest of national security, it will be a usurpatory act.\n\nIn that scenario, the courts will have done more violence to our constitutional system than a foolish Trump tweet ever could."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/08/in-race-to-run-the-democratic-party-common-sense-has-already-lost/", "text": "The Democratic Party isn\u2019t interested in an electoral autopsy. The slow-motion disaster of its search for a new Democratic National Committee chair proves it.\n\nUnlike the Republicans, who commissioned one quickly after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat by President Barack Obama in 2012, many on the left have coped with Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning loss by sticking their heads deeper into the sand of California\u2019s lovely beaches.\n\nBesides, as far as Dems are concerned, who needs a lessons-learned study: Hillary won the popular vote, and only because of the archaic, backward and (sure, why not?) racist Electoral College did Donald Trump steal the presidency from a woman who deserved it more than anybody else. To many Democrats, winning the popular vote was clearly a validation of their party\u2019s platform, if not a mandate to move further left.\n\nJust look at the slate of candidates for DNC chair.\n\nAmong the eight official candidates, only two have a serious chance of winning: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison and Obama\u2019s former secretary of labor, Thomas Perez.\n\nAlready, reporters and pundits have described the contest as the grassroots against the establishment. After former veep Joe Biden endorsed Perez for the job this week, Politico remarked that this helped fuel the perception that the DNC race \u201cwas a proxy battle between the pro-Sanders wing . . . and the establishment-oriented wing\u201d of the Democratic Party.\n\nAs the last election cycle taught us, slapping someone with the establishment label can be a political death sentence. Of course, framing the race this way would be more compelling if it made any sense.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. While \u201cEstablishment vs. Grassroots\u201d makes sexier (and simpler) headlines, a more apt description would be \u201can echo, not a choice.\u201d After all, Perez and Ellison differ little on policy and both solidify the Democrats\u2019 departure from any semblance of 1990s-era Clintonian pragmatism. Sure, Perez worked for Obama, but if that makes you a sellout, then we\u2019ve sure come a long way from Hope and Change.\n\nMore important, the contrived \u201cestablishment vs. base\u201d debate distracts from the real, meaningful differences between the two: the disturbing allegations of anti-Semitism from Ellison and his devotion to radical politics for radicalism\u2019s sake.\n\nJust this week, a long Mother Jones profile of Ellison buried a nasty anecdote from one of his college classmates, who remembered \u201cEllison maintaining that an oppressed group could not be racist toward Jews because Jews were themselves oppressors.\u201d According to the Mother Jones piece, Ellison also allegedly argued that \u201cEuropean white Jews are trying to oppress minorities all over the world,\u201d and that he had a penchant for going on \u201call the time about \u2018Jewish slave traders.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHow progressive.\n\nThese are just the newest allegations. Before becoming a congressman, Ellison worked closely with the Nation of Islam and repeatedly defended the group\u2019s anti-Semitism. As a congressman, he has been a consistent and vicious critic of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from terrorism.\n\nProblem is, this sort of outspoken radicalism is precisely what makes Ellison attractive to bitter base Dems.\n\nThey see the DNC\u2019s concerted effort to help Hillary Clinton overcome the Bernie Sanders insurgency to win the Democratic presidential nomination as the ultimate betrayal. The enthusiasm for Ellison is as much a cathartic exercise for disillusioned Bernie Bros as it is a commitment to so-called progressive principles.\n\nAs the culinary and hospitality union UNITE HERE put it in their endorsement, Ellison \u201ccan tell uncomfortable truths.\u201d In other words, his controversial history only makes him more worthy.\n\nDemocrats would rather go down in flames while sticking up two middle fingers than give any so-called establishment figures more power. Such an exercise in nihilism might provide momentary pleasure, but it certainly doesn\u2019t create winning coalitions. And it\u2019s strategically stupid: Perez is no moderate, but the media treats him like one, which would help the left\u2019s ideas gain mainstream acceptance. Instead, they choose to lash out.\n\nConsidering that elected Democratic officials are close to being on the endangered species list in many states, alienating voters seems even more absurd. All the more so when they don\u2019t need to do it. The fact that they reject Perez not for his policy stands but because he isn\u2019t an offensive-enough firebrand tells us Democrats not only ignore attempts at conducting an autopsy, it guarantees they\u2019ll need another one soon."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/08/dems-supreme-miscalculation-a-lawsuit-trump-will-win-and-other-notable-commentary/", "text": "Conservative: Real Reason Dems Once Backed Gorsuch\n\nTen years ago, recalls Philip Wegmann in the Washington Examiner, Democrats took \u201ca gamble\u201d in 2006 by backing President George W.

In the middle of the election cycle, Public Policy Polling found that 40 percent of Texans would have wanted the state to leave the country if Hillary Clinton had won \u2014 and that included 61 percent of Trump supporters. Nationally, 22 percent of people now want to see their particular state leave the union.\n\nAll of this is pervading our private lives. One post-election survey showed that nearly one in three Democratic women have cut someone out of their lives on social media over Trump\u2019s election. A September poll from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that 70 percent of Americans think the election cycle has made America worse.\n\nBut we\u2019ve been able to get together on some things.\n\nWe seemed to put aside political differences during the World Series, for example. That communal event \u2014 sitting around our televisions watching the greatest Game 7 in baseball history \u2014 seemed to unify us.\n\nThe same thing happened this week with the Super Bowl. We all got together and watched Tom Brady give a performance for the ages, and for a short moment, we got along.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the question: Is that moment a chimera?\n\nI\u2019ve long been an antagonist of the notion that bouncing balls can somehow heal real political divisions. In 2007, I wrote this about the World Cup: \u201cSports solve no great moral dilemmas. Sports are not politics.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still true.\n\nBut sports can provide a breath. Sometimes that breath is actually counterproductive \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t want a sporting event between, say, two warring powers delaying the defeat of an army that was starving hostages and laying siege to civilian population centers.\n\nBut in America, that breath is highly necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s because the left has spent so long politicizing every element of American life that we\u2019re going to need some space, either physical or temporal.\n\nAmericans seem willing to part from their neighbors because they believe their neighbors are in a heightened state of readiness to bother them. Texans think Californians want to control how they raise their children; Californians think Texans want to dirty their air.\n\nFederalism normally provides the distance for both sides to leave each other alone.

But on bigger battles ahead, the Democrats have a powerful weapon \u2014 and they intend to use it.\n\nRepublicans control both houses of Congress and the White House. Yet Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer boasts that he can block Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d Schumer says confidently.\n\nWhat allows Schumer to thwart the majority\u2019s will and paralyze the Senate? Not the Constitution.\n\nThe answer is a centuries-old Senate practice called the filibuster. Senators in the minority could take the floor and talk endlessly, never agreeing to formally end debate so the majority could vote. They\u2019d talk the legislation to death, in the process shutting down all other Senate business. The House never permitted it, always allowing a simple majority to shut down debate.\n\nIn the Senate, the idea was to make sure the minority was heard. But over the years, the rule was exploited to actually stop legislation altogether.\n\nSouthern Democrats used it to block anti-lynching legislation in the 1930s and civil-rights laws in the 1950s. Not until June 10, 1964, were anti-segregationists able to muster enough votes under Senate rules to cut off a filibuster on a major civil-rights bill \u2014 after a staggering 60 days of debate.\n\nThen in 1975, the Senate modified the filibuster. Senators could now close debate and bring legislation to the floor if they had 60 votes to do it. Since then, the minority doesn\u2019t have to monopolize the floor and debate endlessly, shutting down all business. Threatening to do so is enough to hold up a bill.\n\nCall it a fake filibuster. Right now, Republicans have 52 Senate seats, not enough to stop Democrats from filibustering legislation and Supreme Court nominees.\n\nIn recent years, Republicans have benefited from the 60-vote rule. During President Barack Obama\u2019s first two years in office, the Republican Senate minority used it to kill pro-union legislation, the Dream Act, gun control and a federal minimum-wage hike.\n\nNow Democrats want payback. Minutes after Trump announced his Supreme Court nominee, Schumer proclaimed that \u201con a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination,\u201d there have to be 60 votes to move forward.\n\nThat\u2019s politics. But DC insiders talk about the 60-vote rule as if it were sacrosanct, the holy grail of democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s the way our founding fathers set it up,\u201d says Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).\n\nSorry. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe framers designated five circumstances requiring a supermajority: convicting an impeached president or other high officer, amending the Constitution, ratifying a treaty, overturning a presidential veto or expelling a member of Congress. That\u2019s the whole list, and passing laws and confirming nominees aren\u2019t on it.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, the framers considered requiring a supermajority in the Senate to pass laws, but repeatedly rejected the idea.\n\nJames Madison explained in Federalist No. 58 that it would give the minority control over the majority. The \u201cprinciple of free government would be reversed.\u201d Requiring laws to pass two houses of Congress and giving the president a veto were better ways to promote wise lawmaking.\n\nAlexander Hamilton warned that a supermajority requirement would cause \u201ctedious delays,\u201d as it had under the failed Articles of Confederation.

Or have we been divided according to politics all along?\n\nA study out of Yale and Stanford last month in the Journal of Politics found that these days we seek out partners with similar political beliefs far more than in the past. We judge potential partners far more positively when we share politics.\n\nOne of the study\u2019s authors, Neil Malhotra, predicts love will remain a battlefield for those politically opposed. Malhotra tells me in an e-mail, \u201cI think we are going to see more segregated dating because people are increasingly equating political positions with core values (which are important for marriage and raising children).\n\n\u201cPeople no longer view the other side as the loyal opposition, but increasingly as fundamentally immoral.\u201d\n\nStan, 38, in South Brooklyn, says the dynamic is more pronounced than ever.

Bush years behaving as if \u201cthe sky is falling\u201d when they learned he\u2019s a Republican \u2014 but he says now it\u2019s as if the sky has actually fallen: Even though he doesn\u2019t call himself a \u201cTrump supporter,\u201d he gets pushback from women because, as he describes it, \u201cyou are a Nazi unless you reflexively foam at the mouth at everything [Trump] does.\u201d\n\nAmelia in Michigan notes that staying quiet on a date is also not an option. \u201cDating in this over-politicized time is awful. More people want to talk about politics than before, and they tend to think it\u2019s fishy if you want to steer the conversation away from it.\u201d She says she\u2019s unlikely to date liberals because she finds them intolerant of outside viewpoints, though she\u2019s open to the possibility.\n\nBipartisan love does still, of course, exist.

It denies us the fun that comes from dating outside our comfort zone. Intellectually curious daters should look forward to being challenged. Indeed, ideological diversity can be sexy.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one other thing.

It\u2019s a mistake Hillary Clinton made in trying to scare voters away from Trump rather than articulating why she was the right choice.\n\nAnd now the angry left, thinking it\u2019s learning from Clinton\u2019s mistakes, is actually repeating one of her biggest. Essentially, the Clinton faction won the party\u2019s nomination, but the Bernie Sanders faction won the day. Instead of offering independents, moderate Democrats or reluctant Republicans an alternative, those non-liberals see protest after protest, outrage after outrage \u2014 and they\u2019re tuning the anger out and going on with the business of life.\n\nIt appears that the Trump team grasps that with a strategy zeroed in on making the Democrats constantly play defense.\n\nSays Sracic, \u201cTrump issues an executive order beginning the process of dismantling the ACA [Affordable Care Act], and Democrats respond by saying he is trying to \u2018Make America Sick Again.\u2019 People think, however, that the ACA needs to be improved.

His reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, barring funds from international agencies that perform or promote abortion, has solidified his support among religious conservatives. Withdrawing from Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, meeting with union leaders and threatening tough actions against Chinese trade violations have locked in his support from working-class voters.\n\nThis puts Democrats from more working-class areas in a bind. They\u2019re being pushed to the left by the party base, but that makes them more vulnerable to a challenge from a Trump-supported Republican.\n\n\u201cImagine if Trump came to Youngstown [Ohio] and campaigned for a Republican candidate for Congress,\u201d said Sracic. \u201cHe might be able to actually put what has always been a solid blue district in play.\u201d\n\nRight now the youthful, multiethnic, educated Democratic base coalition is too agitated to understand it needs to grow its party\u2019s support and not marginalize itself with some sort of ideological purity test.\n\nBut if the bloody civil war continues, the left will lose yet another seat, like the one in Youngstown that Sracic is talking about, and perhaps more, in 2018."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/2017/01/31/judge-raises-concerns-over-de-blasios-ties-to-consultant/", "text": "A Manhattan judge on Tuesday expressed concern about the apparent conflict of interest in the mayor\u2019s confidential relationship with a political consultant who has business before the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for me to accept this position if it was just the notion of a consultant, but we also have a consultant with possible conflicts.

Two-thirds of all eighth-graders in the United States can\u2019t read or do math at grade level. Poor inner-city kids who are warehoused in failure factories with no other options, and even students in affluent suburban schools, are falling behind their peers in other countries.\n\nGenerations of children are growing up without the knowledge or training to succeed in college or the workplace.\n\nIn short, our public education system is in deep crisis. And that crisis keeps deepening. Thus, we need an outsider: someone who isn\u2019t part of, or beholden to, the education establishment. Someone who will shake it up.\n\nBetsy DeVos not only will do that, she has already. She has been a strong supporter of parent choice as the most effective way to improve opportunities for children trapped in decades-old failing schools. Giving parents the power to decide where to send their kids, whether parochial, charter or district, has been the major driver of true education reform in this country.\n\nDeVos isn\u2019t the only person to recognize the value of parent choice. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren noted in her book \u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d that \u201can all-voucher or all-school choice system would be a shock to the educational system, but the shake out might be just what the system needs.\u201d\n\nSadly, many Democratic senators (including Warren) now say they\u2019ll vote against DeVos\u2019 confirmation. While no doubt they have students\u2019 best interests at heart, it\u2019s yet another indication that the establishment needs an outsider like DeVos.\n\nMany political leaders, including lawmakers who oppose DeVos\u2019 appointment, have themselves personally benefited from a non-public-school education. Indeed, six of the 10 Democrats who serve on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee either attended private or parochial schools themselves or have children or grandchildren who do so.\n\nThe reason so many elected officials who value school choice for themselves and their family members oppose it for others is politics. DeVos, by contrast, isn\u2019t a politician and thus she\u2019s not constrained by the orthodoxy of the educational establishment.\n\nRather, she is somebody who has spent tens of millions of dollars of her own money to give ordinary families the same opportunities that many of the wealthy politicians opposing her nomination have.\n\nFor too long, special interests have dominated the education policymaking system to win better contracts and greater benefits for adults \u2014 and children have paid the price.\n\nHere in New York City, the teachers union recently lobbied policymakers to eliminate independent teacher evaluations, and two years ago convinced Mayor Bill de Blasio to reduce the time teachers spend tutoring struggling students.\n\nUnions support a system that rewards seniority over talent or teacher effectiveness \u2014 and kids lose.\n\nInstead of working to empower great teachers and keep talented educators in every classroom, unions have fought to preserve \u201crubber rooms\u201d in order to keep persistently underperforming teachers on the city payroll, even when those teachers don\u2019t belong in the classroom.\n\nTo end our educational crisis, we need someone who\u2019s willing to stand up to special interests and enact bold reform. DeVos believes in delivering excellence and accountability at every level and across all forms of K-12 education \u2014 whether it be district or charter.\n\nFor the past two decades, she has worked passionately to expand access to great schools for families across the country regardless of ZIP code or background, often in the country\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nFuture generations have much to lose \u2014 but plenty to gain \u2014 in the next four years, and they will have a strong ally fighting for them in Washington, DC, when Betsy DeVos is confirmed.\n\n\n\nEva Moskowitz is the founder and CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools."}, {"url": "http://nypost.com/video/pro-trump-artist-paints-one-for-all-the-liberal-snowflakes-amid-chaos/", "text": "A controversial artist, who loves President Trump and was blacklisted from his local artistic community, was granted the honor of a lifetime.

Not if Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the standard.\n\nStart with this week, when Cuomo again claimed to want to cut middle-class taxes this year: \u201cYou\u2019re under economic stress,\u201d he told New Yorkers. \u201cWe\u2019ll help, we\u2019ll cut the state tax and we\u2019ll help make that burden lighter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a swell instinct \u2014 except, as a Post editorial noted Sunday, the tax cuts he\u2019s talking about were already passed last year.\n\nWhen mystified reporters asked Cuomo why he\u2019d propose them again, he trotted out one of his alternative truths: The cuts have to be approved again this year.\n\n\u201cEvery year is a new year, my friend,\u201d said Trump \u2014 er, Cuomo. \u201cEvery year you start with a blank piece of paper, and every year a law is renewed or a law is extinguished.\u201d\n\nThat may be the case in alternative New York. Here in the real world, once multi-year tax cuts like these have been passed, they can only be \u201cderailed\u201d by a new law, as state fiscal expert E.J. McMahon tweeted. Clearly there\u2019s no need to pass them again; Cuomo\u2019s trying to double-dip on the kudos he got for last year\u2019s move.\n\nHe had other wacky variants on reality this week, too, like claiming the name of his signature \u201ceconomic development\u201d program, Startup New York, can have another meaning: \u201ca generic expression to cover all of our economic development programs.\u201d\n\nAs NY State of Politics\u2019 Nick Reisman noted, \u201cThere\u2019s rarely been any confusion that START-UP NY is a reference to the specific program that provides tax-free zones.\u201d The name\u2019s an acronym: \u201cSUNY Tax-free Areas to Revitalize and Transform UPstate New York.\u201d\n\nOther Cuomo counterfactuals about Startup \u2014 it created 4,000 jobs and cost New Yorkers \u201cnothing\u201d \u2014 are more troubling.\n\nFirst, the official number of jobs produced is closer to 400, not 4,000. The rest are merely projected. (Though even 4,000 is hardly something to brag about in a state with nearly 8 million private-sector jobs.)\n\nSecond, the cost will be hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 unless you are willing to ignore the $53 million spent to advertise Startup, the $323 million in tax revenue Cuomo\u2019s own budget folks predicted the state would forgo over three years and all future costs as well.\n\nCuomo doesn\u2019t want to count the lost tax dollars because he says Startup businesses wouldn\u2019t exist without the program and the tax breaks it offers. So they never would\u2019ve paid any taxes in the first place. Oops: A good number of those companies did, in fact, exist before joining Startup and getting its tax breaks. (And Cuomo now wants to make it even easier for established New York businesses to join.)\n\nThe governor doesn\u2019t just make things up as he goes along; like Trump, he also weaves his fiction into his boilerplate. For years, for example, he has repeatedly claimed New Yorkers could hold down property taxes by \u201cconsolidating\u201d the state\u2019s 10,000 local governments.\n\nHuh? New York doesn\u2019t have 10,000 local governments. According to the Census Bureau, it had just 3,453, as of June 30, 2012. And many already consolidate certain functions. So what\u2019s he talking about?\n\nSome Cuomo Trumpisms are blatant, like saying that closing the Indian Point power plant in Westchester won\u2019t reduce the power supply. Or that his Buffalo Billion is a \u201csuccess,\u201d even though some projects have floundered, eight people were indicted for corruption in connection with it and the economy is still ailing. Or how about his one-time claim that the Moreland Commission was entirely independent \u2014 even as he insisted it\u2019s \u201cmy commission\u201d to do with as he pleased?\n\nOthers are downright comical: He was shocked \u2014 shocked! \u2014 that the Port Authority wanted to raise tolls so steeply in 2011, even though he almost certainly approved the hikes beforehand.\n\nCuomo and Trump aren\u2019t the only pols to peddle whoppers. No one will forget Barack Obama\u2019s ObamaCare myth about keeping your doctor. Hillary Clinton blamed an anti-Muslim video for Benghazi.

Maybe a turn of the other cheek to the boycotters and hooligans and haters?\n\nIf so, you haven\u2019t been paying attention for the last 18 months. America\u2019s new sheriff didn\u2019t come to Washington to make friends or make nice.\n\nHe came to get things done and make change. Big things and big change.\n\nPresident Donald Trump showed again yesterday that he is many things, but not \u2014 NOT \u2014 a politician. He is an outsider, a disrupter, a revolutionary and he made no attempt to disguise his plan to smash the status quo.\n\nHis 16-minute inaugural speech was as subtle as a punch in the nose. Its imagery was brilliant in its starkness, as when he talked of \u201cmothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities\u201d and \u201crusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.\u201d\n\nHe bemoaned that \u201cthe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and redistributed all across the world\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ve defended other nations\u2019 borders without defending our own.\u201d\n\nHe railed against \u201cpoliticians who are all talk and no action\u201d and declared \u201cNow arrives the hour of action.\u201d\n\nAs for big ideas, how about this:\n\n\u201cFrom this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first, America first.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO Trump says 'the people became the rulers' on Inauguration Day 0:0 You\u2019re in charge now, Americans. President Donald Trump thanked his...\n\nOr this, perhaps the most striking line of all:\n\n\u201cJanuary, 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\u201d\n\nThat is an extraordinary statement for any president to make in the world\u2019s oldest democracy. And it was surely the first time a Republican president evoked the principle, if not the slogan, of power to the people.\n\nYet for Trump, the fierce boldness is straight from the heart of his campaign and the reason he was elected. He made himself the beacon of hope for millions who had lost hope and used the biggest possible moment to emphasize that he intends to deliver.\n\nYes, yes, it all still seems highly improbable, that Donald J. Trump would be on that stage to give any speech, let alone as the 45th President of the United States.\n\nBut people grow and change and the former Manhattan playboy and ruthless developer is now reborn as a billionaire populist. What a country!\n\nTrump said in his stirring address at the Republican convention last July, \u201cI am your voice\u201d and now vows that the \u201cforgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\u201d\n\nIt is a direct and true line from then to now and that is the reason there is so much enthusiasm for his presidency from so many Americans. With public trust in government and politicians about as low as it can go, he stands out as something wildly new and very different.\n\nNo one else in polarized Washington could have given that speech. It was non-ideological, neither liberal, nor conservative, though it had strains of both.\n\nRather, it was a plan of action driven by the pragmatic issues he campaigned on: Immigration, trade, infrastructure, law enforcement and security. And above all, jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nTo make his case for a sweeping overhaul, Trump sketched a tale of two countries. One is basking in the affluence gained through self-serving power, and the other is left out and left behind.\n\nNo core conservative would see America that way, and any modern liberal who did would offer a dizzying array of new entitlements and programs.\n\nBecause Trump is neither, and because he excoriated Washington repeatedly, his clarity is a red alert to the establishment, meaning both parties and all the court jesters and hangers-on feasting at the public trough. His tone and substance sent a chill wind through the ranks of the powerful seated all around him.\n\nFor the rest of the world, Trump offered both a carrot and a stick. He talked of seeking \u201cfriendship and goodwill,\u201d but warned that America would from now on put its own interests first.\n\nIt is a mark of how far political correctness has taken us from common sense that his pledge is seen by some as radical or dangerous. Would they have him put America second, or third or maybe not at all?\n\nAnd if a president doesn\u2019t put Americans first, who will?\n\nMost forcefully, Trump pledged to \u201cunite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s vision of a national renewal should be heard by all Americans. It offers a path of shared prosperity and opportunity by demolishing the gridlock that favors connected insiders while stifling upward mobility for all others.\n\nOf course, there will be resistance, some of it legitimate and some borne of narrow self-interest. One of Trump\u2019s challenges will be to find the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nAnother will be for him to keep his promise to listen to dissent, and not surround himself only with those who agree with him. That is the fastest way to isolation and failure.\n\nBut his nonpartisan agenda also challenges those who have vowed to resist him simply because they don\u2019t like him. In addition to a biased, venomous media, their ranks are defined by the nearly 70 House Democrats who skipped the inauguration for no good reason other than selfish politics. Every president deserves a fair chance and they dishonored America by their childish absence.\n\nThey should have followed the examples of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. No two people in the country have more reason to dislike Trump, yet both conducted themselves with total dignity and grace. Whatever their feelings, their behavior was exemplary.\n\nThey lent honor to the grand traditions that help define who we are and what the United States represents in human history. The highly-choreographed transfer of power is no mere archaic symbol. It grows from the founding principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which are the bedrock of the greatest nation ever conceived by man.\n\nWith profound gratitude, we have witnessed those principles being refreshed again through our democracy.

And that he will pivot to a proper presidential persona.\n\nCertainly the oath Trump is about to take \u2014 the affirmation required before he \u201center on the execution of his office\u201d \u2014 ought to be the occasion of national unity. It\u2019s an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nWhat makes it so unifying is that every officer of the United States \u2014 every legislator and judge, not just of the federal government, but of the state and county governments \u2014 must be bound by oath to support the Constitution. New citizens, too.\n\nSo why are the Democrats so bitter? Why are some 50 members of Congress vowing to boycott the inauguration? Why is California hiring a former attorney general to fight the new administration? Why the incessant weeping and wailing?\n\nThe most persuasive theory is that it has nothing to do with meddling by the Russians or James Comey or the crustiness of Trump\u2019s campaign or his personal behavior. Rather, it\u2019s something other than politics. It\u2019s almost psychiatric.\n\nThis was an insight I first heard from one of my journalistic mentors, Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal. Shortly before he died, he wrote two columns on the anger of the Democrats.\n\nBartley comprehended that the Democrats\u2019 fury went beyond politics and \u201cmust have deeper, subconscious roots.\u201d His theory was that they were unable to deal with a sense they were losing their \u201cbirthright.\u201d\n\nWhat he meant was that, as he put it, \u201cbase Democrats think of themselves as the best people: the most intelligent and informed, the most public spirited, the most morally pure.\u201d If that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake, no wonder they\u2019re so devastated.\n\nAt the time Bartley wrote those columns \u2014 late 2003 \u2014 the Democrats were gearing up to run John Kerry for president. They seemed as confident of impending victory then as Hillary Clinton was just three months ago.\n\nBut, as Bartley warned in a particularly prophetic column, that confidence belied the weakness of the glue that held together the party\u2019s coalition. The Democratic Party, he wrote, \u201chas descended into a collection of interest groups not bound together by any ideals.\u201d It was floundering before the American people.\n\n\u201cWe see scions of inherited wealth berating the \u2018rich,\u2019 \u201d Bartley wrote. \u201cWe see supposed champions of civil rights standing in the schoolhouse door to prevent vouchers that might give a break to black children in the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nHow those words echo today, as, say, a visionary advocate of school choice (and a billionaire to boot), Betsy DeVos, is up for confirmation as secretary of education. And as the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet of millionaires enrages the Democrats.\n\nBartley was particularly withering on the betrayal of JFK\u2019s vow \u2014 made in his 1961 inaugural address \u2014 to bear any burden in the cause of liberty, which the Democrats were, when Bartley wrote, then abandoning in Iraq as they had earlier abandoned in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cYes, above all the war,\u201d Bartley wrote. \u201cThe self-identity of the Democratic base is still wrapped up in Vietnam,\u201d which had started as a \u201cliberal, Democratic war\u201d and could only be abandoned by \u201cassertions of a higher morality.\u201d\n\nAnd now Trump is working with Congress on Kennedy-Reagan-style tax cuts. It\u2019s just too much for the Democrats. They can\u2019t process it. They may actually believe that the election is illegitimate.\n\nAll the greater the logic of a unifying speech \u2014 and policies. If Trump gets the tax cuts and deregulation he wants, America will get the investment and jobs growth we need. America will be eager for immigrants.\n\nTo those who\u2019ve been cast from power, I can hear Bartley\u2019s advice as clearly as I heard it when the shoe was on the other foot and the party I was rooting for had lost: Don\u2019t be afraid of the wilderness.\n\nBartley was loved for the strength and optimism he maintained during his wilderness years. He knew its miseries but also its joys, including the chance to think, to experiment and to regroup.\n\nThe Democrats won\u2019t be the only ones in the wilderness, either. Plenty of Republicans were routed by Trump. My own guess is that he\u2019ll come to need them both. It\u2019s a time to remember that they\u2019ll all have been sworn to the same parchment."}, {"url": "http://pagesix.com/2017/01/19/kanye-not-traditionally-american-enough-to-perform-at-inauguration/", "text": "Despite their meeting last month, Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential Inaugural Committee team never asked Kanye West to perform at Friday\u2019s event in Washington, DC.

Snowiest was Taft\u2019s. Ten inches of the stuff. Cheapest? We are not talking a Diamond Jim Brady big-time spread here. We are talking Mickey D\u2019s drive-in snacks.

Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Mary held s\u00e9ances. Eliza taught husband Andrew Johnson how to spell (which doesn\u2019t say much for a president, right?). In the 1900s, Mrs. William Howard Taft smoked cigarettes.\n\nWarren Harding\u2019s missus was the first first lady to vote, first first lady to fly in an airplane, operate a movie camera, own a radio and \u2014 Meryl Streep, pay attention \u2014 first to invite movie stars to the White House.

As in 1829, today\u2019s locals have been warned of another inauguration mob, this time coming to protest the new president. Plus \u00e7a change, it\u2019s politics all over again.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the 2016 election means, more than anything. The return of politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory, over Hillary Clinton and the other Republican candidates, was one of politics over machinery, of a few simple political policies over the belief that elections are a matter of big-dollar donors, data-driven analytics and killer TV ads.\n\nHillary had the ground game, Jeb had Karl Rove, what else did they need? Well, the voters thought things needed fixing in Washington and weren\u2019t fooled by slick machinery.\n\nThere\u2019s another way in which the election was a return to politics. Trump\u2019s victory was a defeat of the progressive\u2019s conceit that he was above politics. He had thought himself in possession of spotless truth, that the arc of history bent only his way, and for such people there\u2019s no room for compromise and no space for politics. He saw his opponents as benighted fools, and thought he\u2019d only muddy himself if he treated them with anything more than disdain.\n\nThat\u2019s how President Obama conducted himself in office and that\u2019s how many Democrats see Republicans, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not emotionally able to accept their defeat. Trump showed them that they were self-deceived, that they weren\u2019t in sole possession of the right and the good, and that\u2019s a deep psychic wound.\n\nThere\u2019s one last way in which Trump\u2019s inauguration represents a return to politics, and that\u2019s as a repudiation of the ideal of a politically neutral administrative state, run by a government of experts whose rules anonymous bureaucrats faithfully follow.\n\nThere were echoes of that in Andrew Jackson\u2019s victory, for the unruly mob that had descended on Washington in 1829 was composed of office-seekers who had been promised patronage jobs in the new administration. And many of them got what they wanted, for Jackson introduced the \u201cspoils system\u201d in which career civil servants were replaced by political appointees.\n\nCivil-service reform, beginning with the 1883 Pendleton Act, was supposed to protect us from Jacksonian politics, creating a merit system that tied the president\u2019s hands in patronage appointments. That was meant to give us an efficient government, free of corruption, with rule by scientific experts.\n\nInstead, we got rule by stale ideologues. Today, when the \u201cdeep state\u201d of federal workers is so wholly opposed to Trump, and is so partisan in its opposition, when they\u2019ll do whatever they can to frustrate Trump\u2019s policies, there\u2019s an argument to be made for a return to politics and an abandonment of our faith in rule by politically neutral experts.\n\nFor examples of the deep state at work, look almost anywhere, to an Environmental Protection Agency on a mission from God, to a politicized Justice Department and most recently to an Office of Government Ethics that blinks at a speck for Trump without seeing the beam of the Clinton Cash machine. You\u2019ll see it when a CIA director tells the president-elect what he can and cannot say.\n\nBut the most shocking example comes from a report in the Jerusalem Post that Obama officials have warned their Israeli counterparts not to share information with the Trump administration because Russian President Vladimir Putin could blackmail the new president. At a time when Trump\u2019s people are talking to Russian officials about ending the war in Syria, that\u2019s a betrayal of our country.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s na\u00efve to expect that the deep state will be single-mindedly loyal to the United States.\n\nBureaucrats have their own interests. They\u2019ll want to keep their jobs, above all, and they\u2019ll be aligned to the kinds of policies that make their jobs more secure. The deep state loves the government that employs them and will seek to subvert an administration that threatens them.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t a Jacksonian. His ideas are much closer to those of Henry Clay, Jackson\u2019s inveterate enemy. But when it comes to civil-service reform, I\u2019d like to see a little more politics, Andrew Jackson-style. Civil-service reform gave us more, not less, corruption.\n\nF.H. Buckley teaches law at George Mason University.

He\u2019s eager to avoid the progressive pique that brought him Zephyr Teachout\u2019s annoying primary challenge in 2014, and a large Green Party dissent vote in the November election.\n\nOn the other hand, even his desire for a strong 2018 showing is linked to his 2020 ambitions: He wants to show Democrats nationwide that he\u2019s a big winner.\n\nThe problem for New York is that it all exacerbates Cuomo\u2019s already-enormous penchant for a big show now, no matter what the hidden costs.\n\nHence his deal to close the Indian Point nuclear plant, his plan for tuition-free college (announced with Sen.

But it holds plenty of independents, too \u2014 and even areas where Democrats are scarce. Cuomo once tried to govern on that basis \u2014 as a sensible liberal careful not to move too far from the center, and eager to show fiscal responsibility.\n\nHe\u2019s still talking fiscal rectitude, mostly opting for items with low price tags (in his estimate, anyway).

But a new book about a landmark speech by George Washington shows that whether you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican, conservative or liberal, Washington might not have been on your side.\n\nJohn Avlon, editor-in- chief of The Daily Beast, calls George Washington\u2019s farewell address \u201cthe most famous American speech you\u2019ve never read.\u201d The 6,088-word, 54-paragraph address was not delivered by Washington in public, but rather published in newspapers in 1796, near the end of his presidency, and announced his decision not to run for a third term.\n\nWritten over five years in collaboration with James Madison and Alexander Hamilton and with input by John Jay, the speech was revered for more than 100 years, much the way the Gettysburg Address is today. It was taught in schools, has been referred to by most US presidents and is still read aloud in Congress every year. But as it\u2019s slipped out of the public sphere over the past century, much of its wisdom has been forgotten by the public.\n\n(That said, the address has been making a small comeback. Jon Stewart spoke of it on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 2012, and the song \u201cOne Last Time\u201d from \u201cHamilton\u201d is about the writing of the speech.)\n\nAmong Washington\u2019s most emphatic beliefs was that the strength of the burgeoning republic depended on the avoidance of warring internal factions. A supporter of political moderation, Washington \u2014 the only independent president in our history \u2014 cautioned frequently, including in his farewell address, about the dangers of choosing party and personal agenda over country.\n\nGiven the fractious state of the new union, this was a major concern of our first president. Washington was ready to retire at the end of his first term in 1792. But those around him begged him to run again, as they saw the country\u2019s factional divide \u2014 led by bitter animosity between Hamilton, an avowed Federalist, and Thomas Jefferson, champion of revolutionary France \u2014 as dire enough to split the union. \u201cThe specter of civil war was invoked to Washington by all three of his closest Cabinet confidants,\u201d writes Avlon. \u201cThis was not an abstract concern.\n\n\u201cThe government was divided between those who were enamored of the French Revolution and those who favored neutrality in the latest war between France and Britain.\n\n\u201cThese political fights threatened to throw the country into paroxysms of separatism and succession, encouraging armed rebellion in distant regions and even the possibility of a foreign-backed coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nWashington believed that nothing was more important to our success and survival than national unity.\n\n\u201cThe subject . . . could inspire Washington to rare rhetorical heights,\u201d Avlon writes. \u201cIt was nothing less than \u2018the palladium of your political safety and prosperity,\u2019 and \u2018a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence.\u2019 In [his] view, we must transcend our tribalism to survive.\u201d\n\nWashington saw his job as attempting to diminish party differences and unite the sides.
