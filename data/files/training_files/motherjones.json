The judge's temporary restraining order represents a major challenge to Trump's action, although his administration could still appeal the ruling and have the policy upheld.  Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, made his ruling effective immediately on Friday, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted straight away. He is expected to issue a full written ruling over the weekend.  Washington Governor Jay Inslee celebrated the decision as a victory for the state, adding: \"no person - not even the president - is above the law.\"  The state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, said: \"This decision shuts down the executive order right now.\" He said he expected the federal government to honor the ruling.  The Justice Department made no immediate decision on an appeal. The Department looks forward to reviewing the courts written order and will determine next steps, it said in a statement.  The new Republican president's order signed on Jan. 27 triggered chaos at U.S. airports last weekend. Some travelers abroad were turned back from flights into the United States, crowds of hundreds of people packed into arrival areas to protest and legal objections were filed across the country.  The challenge in Seattle court was brought by the state of Washington and later joined by the state of Minnesota. The judge ruled that the states have legal standing to sue, which could help Democratic attorneys general take on Trump in court on issues beyond immigration.  Washington's case was based on claims that the state had suffered harm from the ban, for example students and faculty at state-funded universities being stranded overseas.  Judge Robart probed a Justice Department lawyer on the \"litany of harms suffered by Washington states universities, and also questioned the administration's use of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States as a justification for the ban.  Robart said no attacks had been carried out on U.S. soil by individuals from the seven countries affected by the travel ban since that assault. For Trumps order to be constitutional, Robart said, it had to be based in fact, as opposed to fiction.  The judge's decision was welcomed by groups protesting the ban.  This order demonstrates that federal judges throughout the country are seeing the serious constitutional problems with this order, said Nicholas Espiritu, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.  Eric Ferrero, Amnesty International USA spokesman, lauded the short-term relief provided by the order but added: \"Congress must step in and block this unlawful ban for good.\"  FOUR STATES IN COURT  The decision came on a day that attorneys from four states were in courts challenging Trump's executive order. The Trump administration justified the action on national security grounds, but opponents labeled it an unconstitutional order targeting people based on religious beliefs.  Earlier on Friday, a federal judge in Boston declined to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the United States from countries affected by Trump's three-month ban.  U.S. District Judge Nathan Gorton expressed skepticism during oral arguments about a civil rights group's claim that Trump's order represented religious discrimination.  The State Department said on Friday that fewer than 60,000 visas previously issued to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen had been invalidated as a result of the order. That disclosure followed media reports that government lawyers were citing a figure of 100,000.  U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia ordered the federal government to give the state a list by Thursday of \"all persons who have been denied entry to or removed from the United States.\"  The state of Hawaii on Friday also filed a lawsuit alleging that the order is unconstitutional and asking the court to block the order across the country.  Trump's directive also temporarily stopped the entry of all refugees into the country and indefinitely halted the settlement of Syrian refugees.  On Friday the Department of Homeland Security issued additional clarification of the order, stating that there were no plans to extend it beyond the seven countries. The DHS also reiterated that the ban did not apply to permanent residents, or green card holders, and some others, such as those who have helped the U.S. military.

The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a US government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters.  The program, \"Countering Violent Extremism,\" or CVE, would be changed to \"Countering Islamic Extremism\" or \"Countering Radical Islamic Extremism,\" the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States.  Such a change would reflect Trump's election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase \"radical Islam\" in describing it. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries.  The CVE program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google and Facebook.  Some proponents of the program fear that rebranding it could make it more difficult for the government to work with Muslims already hesitant to trust the new administration, particularly after Trump issued an executive order last Friday temporarily blocking travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  Still, the CVE program, which focuses on US residents and is separate from a military effort to fight extremism online, has been criticized even by some supporters as ineffective.  A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus.  In a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.  Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration, the money still may not go out the door, the source said, adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter.  The department declined comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  PROGRAM CRITICIZED  Some Republicans in Congress have long assailed the program as politically correct and ineffective, asserting that singling out and using the term \"radical Islam\" as the trigger for many violent attacks would help focus deterrence efforts.  Others counter that branding the problem as \"radical Islam\" would only serve to alienate more than three million Americans who practice Islam peacefully.  Many community groups, meanwhile, had already been cautious about the program, partly over concerns that it could double as a surveillance tool for law enforcement.  Hoda Hawa, director of policy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said she was told last week by people within DHS that there was a push to refocus the CVE effort from tackling all violent ideology to only Islamist extremism.  \"That is concerning for us because they are targeting a faith group and casting it under a net of suspicion,\" she said.  Another source familiar with the matter was told last week by a DHS official that a name change would take place. Three other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such plans had been discussed but were unable to attest whether they had been finalized.  The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counter terrorism effort. In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated.  Among those approved were local governments, city police departments, universities and non-profit organizations. In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic State's recruitment in the United States, grants also went to Life After Hate, which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists.  Just in the past two years, authorities blamed radical and violent ideologies as the motives for a white supremacist's shooting rampage inside a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, and Islamist militants for shootings and bombings in California, Florida and New York.  One grant recipient, Leaders Advancing & Helping Communities, a Michigan-based group led by Lebanese-Americans, has declined a $500,000 DHS grant it had sought, according to an email the group sent that was seen by Reuters. A representative for the group confirmed the grant had been rejected but declined further comment.  \"Given the current political climate and cause for concern, LAHC has chosen to decline the award,\" said the email, which was sent last Thursday, a day before Trump issued his immigration order, which was condemned at home and abroad as discriminating against Muslims while the White House said it was to \"to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals.\"  (Reporting by Julia Edwards and Dustin Volz in Washington, Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington; editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)", "date": "2017/02/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/Trump-counterterrorism-Islam", "title": "Trump to Focus Counter-Extremism Program Solely on Islam"}, {"text": "Worshippers leave the Islamic Center of Murfreeboro after midday prayers on Aug. 10, 2012.  In August 2012, a mosque opened in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a bustling college town outside of Nashville that is home to students, long-time residents, refugees, suburban families, and everyone in between. The national headlines for the stories about the event suggested some of the conflicts that had led to this moment: The New York Daily News wrote, \"Tennessee Mosque Opens After Years of Controversy,\" the New York Times wrote \"After a Struggle, Mosque Opens in Tennessee\", and NPR wrote \"Murfreesboro Mosque Finally Opens.\"  But the summer day when it opened was peaceful and harmonious, with the exception of a lone protester, wearing an \"I Love Jesus\" hat and a shirt bearing the 10 Commandments. The day was one for celebration, and the members of the Muslim community who had gathered were not dwelling on the fact that during court battles over permits, Rutherford County had spent more than $340,000 in legal fees fighting the right to build this place of worship. Or that the lieutenant governor of Tennessee at the time, Ron Ramsey, had described Islam as a \"cult\" while voicing opposition to the mosque.  Schoolchildren have come home crying because other children asked if their headscarves are hiding a bomb.  The community itself was split between those attacking the approximately 300 families of the mosque for being Muslim and those who banded with their Muslim neighbors. The peaceful community was the target of a bomb threatthe anonymous caller, later found to be a Texas man, promised it would go off inside the office space where the community was worshipping in the interim on Sept. 11. A vandal scrawled \"not welcome\" across a sign announcing the construction of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. Construction equipment used to build the walls of the mosque was set on fire, its charred remains a warning to worshippers that they were not safe. But after two troubled years, the mosque finally opened, and residents began to take its presence on Veals Road for granted.  Then Donald Trump was elected, and the anti-Muslim rhetoric that once inflamed the Bible Belt town of 126,000 was reignited.  Murfreesboro is home to a very small fraction of American Muslims, but it was primed for a backlash in a unique way. Most residents remember the saga of the mosque, and the Baptist church next door made its anti-Islam position very clear by erecting 13 10-foot-tall crosses into the ground \"to make a statement.\" There are residents of Murfreesboro who stood with their Muslim neighbors, leaving flowers and handwritten cards at the front door of the mosque, but there are increasingly louder voices that threaten the safety of others who happen to be Muslim. It's a sort of microcosm of what has happened across the country, where tensions and even violence have escalated against Muslims in the wake of the inflammatory rhetoric of President Donald Trump.  \"People are afraid, and they won't tell others about [harassment],\" says Saleh Sbenaty, a leader in the Muslim community, who was deeply involved in the struggle to get the mosque built. \"It's really scary and dangerous.\"  He added that some members of the mosque have told him they are considering not attending services because they are frightened of the possibility of an attack. When news broke that a mosque in Texas had been set on fire shortly after Trump announced an executive order temporarily banning refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries, they prayed for safety. When a shooting at a Quebec City mosque by a 27-year-old white male who was reportedly \"a right-wing troll who frequently took anti-foreigner and anti-feminist positions and stood up for U.S. President Donald Trump\" left six dead and more injured three days after Trump's executive order, they felt their worst fears were being confirmed.  \"The people who are supposed to protect us are singling our community out.\"  The Sbenaty family left Syria because it was unsafe, and they wanted a better life for themselves and their children. His daughter Dima was born in Damascus, but her mother brought her to the United States when she was eight months old to join Saleh, who was earning his PhD at the time. Their son, Salim, was born in Murfreesboro. A week after the inauguration, 20-year-old Salim, was waiting tables at a local restaurant when he was asked, \"Son, where are you from?\"  \"I was born and raised here in Murfreesboro,\" he replied.  The response was abrupt. \"You look foreign.\"  \"My parents came from Damascus a long time ago,\" Salim said. The man stared.  \"I'm going to the car to get my gun.\"  Later that night, he told his father, who was horrified, and asked how he responded. Salim said the man had probably never met anyone who looked like him before, and he did not want to deepen his hatred. Saleh says many people in the Muslim community in Murfreesboro would have done the same, although he encouraged his son to report the incident.  During his campaign, Trump went back and forth on a proposal to create a \"Muslim registry.\" When he was asked about it in November 2015, he said, \"We're going to have to look at a lot of things very closely. We're going to have to look at the mosques.\" Later, he said he wanted to have a database on Syrian refugees who immigrate into the United States. Less than a month later, in December 2015, he proposed banning all Muslim immigration. Trump has consistently talked about the threat of \"radical Islam,\" and in an interview with CNN last year, he told Anderson Cooper, \"I think Islam hates us.\"  Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, has also been vocal about his views on Islam. \"We are in an outright war against jihadist, Islamic fascists,\" Bannon said in a 2014 speech. He also said the religion was metastasizinglike cancer.  Some Tennessee lawmakers have spouted similar claimsTennessee state Sen. Mae Beavers told town hall attendees on Feb. 16 that Muslim terrorists were \"infiltrating churches\" and planning jihad in the Bible Belt. She also has expressed support for Trump's \"Muslim ban.\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who served as a vice chair of Trump's transition team, said Trump's immigration order was a \"security test, not a religious one.\"  \"Our intelligence and security agencies must ascertain the scope of the Islamic terror threat in order to develop proper refugee vetting protocolsif possible,\" she wrote in an op-ed for The Tennessean.  And now, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, anti-Muslim hate groups have tripled since 2015.  Ossama Bahoul, the former imam at the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, said there is a big difference between what the Muslim community in Middle Tennessee went through when the mosque was being built and what is happening now. Back then, the government was on their sideit defended his people's right to worship and promised to take swift action against anyone who threatened them. Now, he hears the Islamophobia that used to come from the mouths of protesters coming from the government. \"It is really disturbing for me to be talking about this,\" Bahloul said. \"The people who are supposed to protect us are singling our community out. That's tough.\"  Bahloul and Saleh Sbenaty tell Mother Jones about women who had been threatened for wearing the hijab and sometimes, Bahloul said, people have tried to assault them. Schoolchildren have come home crying because other children asked if their headscarves are hiding a bomb. Other Muslims have told him they have heard mutterings of \"it's about time to clean up America\" and \"go back home\" when they pass by.  \"They are American kids, and they will come at a very young age and say, 'Why do they hate us?'\"  Recently, when another student at school referred to one of the children in his congregation as \"Bin Laden,\" Bahloul found himself at a loss. \"[Our] kids were born in Americathey don't speak any language but English,\" he said. \"They are American kids, and they will come at a very young age and say, 'Why do they hate us?'\"  The effects of Trump's comments about Muslims is not restricted to the random acts of violence directed at Muslims in the United States. The executive order he signed banning refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countriesincluding Syriamean the Sbenatys and other families fear they'll be separated from family members for quite some time. Saleh hasn't seen his mother, who is 83, in 11 years. He wants to bring her to America, but the recent events make that seem unlikely. His siblings got married after he left Syria, and he has nieces and nephews he has never met. Minutes after the Ninth Circuit Court filed a preliminary injunction against Trump's immigration order, effectively putting it on hold, Trump tweeted, in all caps: \"See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!\"  \"Now there is no option for me to go and visit or for them to come over here,\" Saleh told Mother Jones before the court ruling. \"It's something you cannot explain in words.\"  Dima Sbenaty, Saleh's daughter, is a 27-year-old clinical coordinator for the stroke unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The week after Trump's \"Muslim ban\" took effect, she spoke at a vigil in support of Muslim Americans. Thousands showed up. \"Islam taught me to give back...As a Muslim, it is my obligation to you to be strong, to uphold justice, and to protect your rights,\" she told the crowd that night. \"That is how America raised me.\"  Recently, she decided to start wearing a hijab, and because of the outward signifier that she is Muslim, she has encountered some animosity in the workplace. Sometimes, when she's out running errands, she gets an uncomfortable sensation, like she's being watched by someone with less-than-friendly intentions. But she's determined not to let fear rule her. \"I'm practicing my freedom by covering my hair; I'm practicing my freedom by saying that I'm Muslim and going to the mosque,\" she tells Mother Jones. \"That's my freedom as an American, and I don't think I should be afraid...Refugees are leaving a place where they're being dehumanized. They're coming into [America] to seek refuge, and they're entering another hell.\"  As for Imam Bahloul, he is still wrestling with how to explain to the community what is happening and how to deal with being targeted. \"For a girl to cry and say, 'I want to cover my hair, but I'm scared,' that girl must not be scared in America,\" he said. \"We're part of the American fabric.\"", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/mosque-tennessee-syrian-refugees", "title": "Here's What It's Like to Be Muslim in the Bible Belt in 2017"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  a move that could leave some 30 million Americans without health insurance. ACA literally sustains millions of lives . Without the health insurance it provides, many people wouldn't have access to medicine and procedures that they need to survive. When we asked people on Twitter and through healthcare advocacy organizations to share their stories of how ACA keeps them alive, we were overwhelmed with responses. We heard from people waiting for organ transplants, from cancer survivors, from people with debilitating mental illness, and more. They told us about the toll that disease has taken on their lives: Before the ACA, some were forced to skip treatments because of the price; others couldn't get insurance at all because they were already sick. Here are a few of their stories.  Claudette Williams, 58, Orlando, Florida: I lost my job in 2005. After that I decided to purchase a policy. I found them online. They had a gentleman come to my house, and we talked about my blood pressure medications. The insurance was almost twice what they had quoted me because of the medication, and also because of my condition. I eventually couldn't afford it any more. I was uninsured, except for one year when I qualified for Medicaid. I ended up in the emergency room on a few occasions for heart trouble. I also developed diabetes. I couldn't afford to have regular mammograms. In 2014 I signed up for Obamacare. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September of last year. The lumpectomy alone was billed at $40,000. I have four more chemo sessions to go, and after that, I have to do radiation. Luckily my cancer is only a stage one, so my prognosis is pretty good. But it is really scary thinking about my insurance being taken away. This is a fight for my life.  Charis Hill, 30, California: When I was 25, in 2012, I had a series of unexplained and undiagnosable respiratory challenges that felt like the flu or bronchitis or pneumonia. Doctors just couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. My condition got worse and worse. I visited urgent care a few times. I thought I was having a heart attack once. They tried to blame it on anxiety.  As hard as I fight to be healthy, I'm never going to be healthy, and I'm always going to have to rely on the medical system to keep me alive.  Eventually reached out to my dad, who was estranged from me. I knew that he had a severe health condition. The first words out of his mouth were, it sounds like you have what I have, which is ankylosing spondylitis (AS). I knew that I would need health insurance to be treated. But if I were to get a diagnosis before getting health insurance, I would have the preexisting condition working against me. So I got the cheapest plan that existed. I wasn't getting all the tests done or getting all the treatments. Then, ten months later, the ACA was implemented, and because of my income, I was eligible for a subsidy to purchase health insurance on the exchange in California. I got a better plan for less than I was paying before, which meant that I could access more treatment and not skip medication.  I have infusions of a drug every eight weeks. I have to go to an infusion center for 2.5 hours. There's no generic. There's no way to get those treatments unless I have insurance. They slow down the progression of my disease. I also take anti-inflammatory medications orally. AS is a severe inflammatory condition. It primarily affects the spine. It causes a lot of pain and fatigue from the body trying to fight that inflammation. I'm permanently disabled. I was a college athlete, and now I'm not even able to run. I use a wheelchair sometimes. As hard as I fight to be healthy, I'm never going to be healthy, and I'm always going to have to rely on the medical system to keep me alive.  John Weiler, 27, Oakland, California: I got HIV when I was 19. When I was in college, I was on my parents health insurance, so when I started meds when I was 21, I took it for granted that I was going to have insurance that would cover it, because it was so easy. When I went to grad school, I naively accepted a position without asking any questions about how the insurance was structured. When you do a science PhD, it's typical for the school to pay your tuition, pay your health insurance premium, and give you a stipend. In my program, the stipend is about $30,000 a year. So when I enrolled and started to look at my insurance situation, I realized the policy offered to students provided up to $10,000 worth of prescription coverage per academic year, and that was it. But in 2013, the student government got together and petitioned the university to change across the UC system. The students basically said, 'We don't care if our insurance premiums are higher, we don't want these things that the ACA offers to not be part of the insurance plan for the school.'  I was on a med cocktail called Complera, and that one was $22,000 a year. HIV meds are super expensive. I switched to a different medication since then, called Stribild, and I don't know exactly what it is this year, but if I remember correctly, that one was closer to $27,000 a year.  I'm about to graduate and find a job, and, let's say worst case scenario, first Congressional session they manage to totally gut the ACA and revert to how things were before. If that were to happen and I were to get a job, it would be totally legal for an employer to be like, 'Hey, yeah, we're not covering this.' I'd be looking at close to $35,000 a year in medical expenses just for maintenance, let alone if I got sick.  Ruth Linehan, 26, Portland, Oregon: I graduated college in May 2012. I was 22. About a month later, I started an internship as a software developer at a Portland startup. Thanks to ACA I was on my parents' insurance. After four months I was offered a full time job, but the insurance didn't start until 6 weeks after my first day as an employee. On my first day I was diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma. I looked like I was 7 months pregnant. I started chemo the day after I was hospitalized. This is an incredibly fast-growing cancer. I was in the hospital for seven weeks. I received about four rounds of chemo. After four months I was declared in remission. I continue to be in remission. The hospital bills were about half a million dollars. I only had to pay about $10,000 because I was on my parents' insurance.  If I lose my job and the cancer comes back, what am I going to do? I worry about illness down the road. I've had cancer at a very young age and a lot of very harsh chemo. I worry that I won't be able to get affordable insurance, or get insurance at all.  Larry Sterlingshires, 35, Tennessee: I have a condition called hidradenitis surruptivalook it up, do not look at pictures, because it's not a good timeit's a chronic skin condition that's ultimately debilitating. As it progresses, it causes tissue degradation on the skin layer that doesn't heal, like normal wounds do. Sometimes it creates lesions that don't heal for a year and half. It's debilitating because it's painfulthe tissue underneath is exposed without that protective layer, so it bleeds regularly. You have to keep everything patched and bandaged, and it easily gets infected. But because of the ACA, I can have medication that can't completely undo the symptoms, but it seems to have halted its progression, and even promoted some healing. Complications related to the tissue damage and infections can be fatal.  You can imagine the fear I havebeing so close to getting a transplantthat they might repeal the ACA right away, and I will no longer have access to insurance, and I won't be able to get my transplant.  The medications I'm on right now, in addition to just my normal medications for diabetes and hypertension, will help me survive longer. This lets me afford something called Claravis, and another medication called Humira. Humira runs approximately $7300 a month, and the Claravis is about $4000 a month. Those basically keep me functional without being completely disabled. That's no exaggeration. If you check the disability schedule, it's so painful and considered debilitating enough that you can qualify for full disability with it. The Affordable Care Act covers all of that medication in full. I come from poverty, I'm just now getting used to having insurance for the first time in my adult life, and now that seems like it might evaporate.  Debbie Lynn Smith, 59, Las Vegas, Nevada: I was a TV writer and producer. In 2000 I was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans. It's also called popcorn lung. I got it from buttered popcorn. When you work in TV, you work 15 hour days. They provide snacks and things. Microwave popcorn is one of the things they give you. I ate a lot of it. It just so happened that I was susceptible to this disease.  I was in remission for 16 years, but I was living with 50 percent of my lung capacity. I couldn't do TV anymore, couldn't put in those long hours. I really had a hard time working and being reliable because I would get sick. So I couldn't get insurance through work. I had insurance through the high-risk California program and I was paying $2,000 a month for that. My husband was on it, too, he had prostate cancer. We moved to Nevada. When the ACA came around we were ecstatic. We were both out of work at the time, so we went on ACA.  This year, in April, my disease came out of remission. I am now down to 30 percent of my lung capacity and waiting for a lung transplant. So you can imagine the fear I havebeing so close to getting a transplantthat they might repeal the ACA right away, and I will no longer have access to insurance, and I won't be able to get my transplant. I am extremely stressed. I was so stressed before the election that I could not take anything else. I was working for Hillary and I ended up in the hospital.  Michele Munro, 64, Southern California: I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. I was 44. I was a single mom with two boys. I had Kaiser insurance. It wasn't a bad cancer, and we caught it early. Then seven years later I was diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer. That was 2004. I also had a hip replacement. The Kaiser premium doubled, so I went without insurance for the first time in years. I was working as a freelancer, and insurers told me I was uninsurable. In 2011, ACA started to kick in. It was not allowing insurance companies to consider preexisting conditions. I applied and was accepted into Aetna. The first thing I did was go for a mammogram, and, sure enough, I had a triple-negative tumor. Very aggressive. It was small and early, so we caught it just in time. I had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and breast reconstruction, all covered through ACA. I went into the hospital seven times total for infections. The billing was $900,000. Aetna settled and paid out $180,000.  I exercise a lot. I'm doing everything I can on my end. But there is only so much you can do. I'm scared for myself, and also for my children.  I'm feeling really good right now because December was the fifth anniversary of being cancer-free. I exercise a lot. I'm doing everything I can on my end. But there is only so much you can do. I'm scared for myself, and also for my children. My parents had to claim bankruptcy for health insurance reasons. They were not covered for a medical emergency.  Suzanna Moore, 29, Fairfield, Iowa: When I was a baby, I had a stroke. I recovered well, but I would always have issues afterward. Throughout my childhood, it always a concern if I would have proper health care. I grew up in a pretty poor family in New England. With Obamacare, I went to an orthopedist for the first time in forever and got a prescription for orthotics to alleviate chronic pain in my knees and ankles on one side, because my right side was affected more from the stroke than my left side. The pain built up for a while, but basically throughout my twenties, I was never able to get it addressed, because I was living on my own in Tennessee and was unable to focus any money toward my personal health care.  I also had a meniscus tear during that time. Had I had surgery on that on my own, it would have been like $15,000 or more. With Obamacare, we still had to prioritize, but we didn't go in debt over it.  My husband has a rare condition called achalasia, which means the muscles in his throat stopped working the way they were supposed to, so he had trouble swallowing and eating. He had to force food down his esophagus with air and water. After a while, it got so painful that he was eating less and he was losing weight rapidly. It was hindering his quality of life, and, left untreated, it could contribute to throat cancer. So he had to have surgery about eight months after I had my knee surgery. We were able to afford all of it. We wouldn't have been able to do that without Obamacare.", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/obamacare-saved-my-life", "title": "8 People Who Owe Their Lives to Obamacare"}, {"text": "Last summer, the Obama Department of Justice announced it would no longer use private prisons.

Multiple refugees were detained by customs officials across the country, as lawyers scrambled to file lawsuits against the Trump administration, and protesters planned demonstrations outside airports.  On Friday, Trump signed an executive order requiring immigration authorities to:  Suspend all refugee resettlement for 120 days and reduce the number of refugees resettled in the country to 50,000;  Immediately deny entry to the United States to anyone from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days;  Ban Syrian refugees from resettling in the United States;  Prioritize refugee claims \"on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"  Confusion reigned as details began to emerge about just how many people might be covered by the executive orderpotentially throwing hundreds of thousands of travelers into legal limbo. The State Department issued a statement on Saturday afternoon saying that citizens from the seven banned countries who hold dual nationality would also be blocked from entering the US, according to the Wall Street Journal. (The dual-citizenship restriction wont apply to those holding US passports.) The ban could also affect some 500,000 people from those countries already in the United States on green cards or other temporary visas, according to ProPublica.

Read the full order here:  So far, 12 people have been detained at JFK airport in New York, according to CNN. The New York Times reports that passengers were turned away at airports in Dubai and Istanbul, and at least one family was ejected from a flight.  Iran issued a swift response to Trumps ban, saying it would ban all US citizens from entering the country. \"The US decision to restrict travel for Muslims to the US, even if for a temporary period of three months, is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular to the great nation of Iran, Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \"Despite the claims of combating terrorism and keeping American people safe, it will be recorded in history as a big gift to extremists and their supporters.\" The ban would remain in place until the US lifted its restrictions on Iran, according to the statement.  Civil rights and refugee resettlement organizations are readying themselves for a fight against the order. On Friday evening, the Council for American-Islamic Relations announced it would file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order. \"There is no evidence that refugeesthe most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nationare a threat to national security,\" CAIR national litigation director Lena Masri said in a press release.  The American Civil Liberties Union also filed suit Saturday morning on behalf of two Iraqi men who were already on their way to the United States and had been detained at New York's JFK airport. One, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had worked as an interpreter during the Iraq War, was released Saturday afternoon.  Protests broke out in New York Wednesday evening in response to leaked versions of the ban. More protests were planned across the country for Saturday afternoon.  \"No hate, no fear.

Surrounded by men, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday reinstating the \"global gag rule,\" which bans federal funding for international non-governmental organizations that offer abortions or advocate for the right to an abortion.  The Ronald Reagan-era order, also known as the Mexico City policy, has been instituted by Republican presidents, and then killed by Democratic presidents, since its inception. Obama signed an executive order early in his presidency to reverse it.  According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, women in poor countries suffer the most from this policy. A 2003 analysis found that the rule leads to unsafe abortions, which are the second-leading cause of death for women of reproductive age in Ethiopia and account for more than 40 percent of the maternal mortality rate in Kenya. Peru has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Latin America, in part because of its high rate of clandestine abortions.  The 1973 Helms Amendment already bans the use of American foreign aid for abortions. Money from the United States can go to organizations that educate women about abortions or perform abortions, as long as it's not used for the procedure itself. The gag rule would deny US funding to any international organization that mentions abortion as an option for women seeking help with an unwanted pregnancyeven if that organization largely provides contraception or more general reproductive health care.  The United States currently spends about $600 million annually on family planning and reproductive health programs in foreign countries. The Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that studies reproductive health care, estimates that a loss of this funding would translate to 38,000 more abortions. Marie Stopes International, one of USAID's biggest family planning partners, estimates that the global gag rule will lead to an additional 2.2 million abortions worldwide.  The international assistance funding provides access to contraceptive services and supplies for 27 million women and couples.  In a statement, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) promised to introduce a bill to repeal the rule on Tuesday. \"The Trump Administration and Republican leadership have made no secret of their dangerous obsession with rolling back reproductive rights,\" she said. \"President Trump's reinstatement of the Global Gag Rule ignores decades of research, instead favoring ideological politics over women and families.\"", "date": "2017/01/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-global-gag-rule", "title": "Trump Reinstates Global Gag Rule to Cut Off Family Planning Funds Abroad"}, {"text": "The process of repealing Obamacare began yesterday in the Senate, and Republicans rejected the amendment that requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of contraceptives in the process.  In 2012, a women's preventative health care provision within the Affordable Care Act went into effect making birth control free for women with insurance. When it was first rolled out, an estimated 26.9 million women benefited. If the mandate is struck down, it will leave 55 million women without no-copay birth control.  During the budget negotiations that took place Wednesday night, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) penned an amendment to preserve protections for women that were created under the ACA, but it was voted down. The measure aimed to ensure that women receive birth control and mammograms without charge, required insurance companies to cover maternity care, prevented insurance companies from charging women more for preexisting conditions, and sought to even out health care costs between men and women.  \"If my colleagues destroy the Affordable Care Act, it will have real, direct, and painful consequences for millions of American women and their families,\" Gillibrand said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.  The Senate also voted down the preexisting-conditions protection, which prevented insurance companies from considering pregnancy as a preexisting condition.  Last night's vote is just one piece of what will be a very long process in the effort to repeal Obamacare. Next, the current measure goes to the House, which is expected to approve it on Friday.

Yocca, 32, pled guilty to \"attempted procurement of a miscarriage\" and was sentenced to one year in jail. She received credit for her time already served, which means she served her entire sentence while awaiting trial. Her sentence also comes with a $3,000 fine.  Yocca was originally jailed on December 9, 2015, two months after she filled a bathtub with water and attempted to self-abort using a coat hanger. Her boyfriend, alarmed at the amount of blood, drove her to the hospital, where she gave birth to a child that was placed under the custody of the Department of Children's Services. The child had severe medical problems resulting from the premature delivery and the attempted termination of the pregnancy.  The case gained national attentionTennessee has abortion clinics in only four cities in the state, and reproductive rights advocates denounced Yocca's imprisonment by pointing out the state's very restrictive anti-abortion laws and that women who live there have little access to the procedure.  Yocca was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder, but that charge was downgraded to aggravated assault last spring. In November, three new charges were filed against her by a Rutherford County grand jury: aggravated assault with a weapon, attempted procurement of a miscarriage, and attempted criminal abortion. She pled not guilty later that month.  Had Yocca stood trial and been found guilty of all three charges, she could have faced a possible sentence of 6 to 24 years in jail and up to $18,000 in fines.

His remarks come two days after a Republican-led House investigative panel released a report that recommended the health care provider be defunded. The investigative panelcreated to examine allegations that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profitwas then disbanded, because it was not reauthorized for a new Congress. Planned Parenthood was never found guilty of any wrongdoing at the state or federal level, despite multiple GOP-led investigations.  Democrats immediately denounced the move. \"I just would like to speak individually to women across America: This is about respect for you, for your judgment about your personal decisions in terms of your reproductive needs, the size and timing of your family or the rest, not to be determined by the insurance company or by the Republican ideological right-wing caucus in the House of Representatives,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \"So this is a very important occasion where we're pointing out very specifically what repeal of the [Affordable Care Act] will mean to women.\"  The measure to cut funding will appear in a special fast-track bill expected to pass Congress in February, during a session that allows legislation to bypass filibuster. The bill would need only a simple majority of senators to pass, rather than a 60-vote supermajority. Should the measure pass, according to the Washington Post, the largest women's health care organization in the country would lose 40 percent of its funding. Planned Parenthood received $528 million in federal funding in 2014, and the government is its largest single source of funding.  A federal law known as the Hyde Amendment forbids the use of any federal funds for abortions. The money Planned Parenthood receives is for preventative screenings, birth control, and general women's health care for their 2.5 million patients.  Defunding Planned Parenthood is a misnomer. Their true intent is to block millions of people who rely on Medicaid from PP health centers.  Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 5, 2017  Rep. Diane DeGette (D-Colo.) promised that Democrats would \"stand against this with every fiber of our beings.\"  A similar measure passed the House and the Senate in 2015 but was repealed once it reached President Barack Obama's desk. Obama has long supported the preservation of Planned Parenthood's federal funding. In December, he issued a rule that barred states from withholding funds from Planned Parenthood based on the fact that they provide abortion care.  President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that he opposes continuing federal funding for Planned Parenthood, so a presidential veto would be unlikely. Similarly, Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been staunchly anti-abortion throughout his political careerhe signed a measure to defund Planned Parenthood in Indiana during his tenure as governor, and he was successful in slashing funding for the provider in his state.  Reacting to Ryan's proposal, Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action fund, told reporters, \"It's likely no accident that this attack was launched the day after Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a long-time opponent of Planned Parenthood, held a closed-door meeting with Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership.\"", "date": "2017/01/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/paul-ryan-promises-gop-will-defund-planned-parenthood", "title": "Paul Ryan Says the GOP Will Vote to Defund Planned Parenthood"}, {"text": "Last year set another record for exonerations, with 166 convicted people vindicated by courts in 25 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico and by federal courts. A new report reveals a sobering truth behind the wrongful convictions of innocent people: Black Americans are more likely to serve time in prison for crimes they didn't commit than their white counterparts.  In the National Registry of Exonerations' new report, Race and Wrongful Convictions in the United States, researchers looked at the 1,900 exonerations reported in the Registry between 1989 and October 2016. They found that while African Americans comprise only 13 percent of the population, they comprise 47 percent of those who were exonerated. This disparity cuts across all major crimes committed, but the report focuses on the three categories where exonerations are most frequent: murder, sexual assault, and drug crimes.  \"There's no doubt anymore that innocent people get convicted regularlythat's beyond dispute,\" said Barbara O'Brien, a Michigan State University law professor and editor for the registry, in a press release.  Black people are seven times more likely than white people to be wrongfully convicted of murder, and cases where black people were exonerated were 22 percent more likely to involve police misconduct than cases involving white people.  For example, Walter McMillian was sentenced to life in prison in 1988 for the 1986 murder of a white woman in Monroeville, Alabama. The only evidence against McMillian was testimony by Ralph Myers, who was arrested for murdering another woman in a nearby town. Police told Myers that they had witnesses who would testify that he had murdered the woman in Monroeville along with McMillian, who was also known in the community because he had a white girlfriend. Despite six alibi witnesses who placed him at a fish fry at the time of the murder, the mostly white jury sentenced McMillian to life in prison; a judge overruled the jury and sentenced him to death. A few years later, however, McMillian's lawyers discovered a recording of Myers complaining that officers forced him to implicate McMilliana man he didn't even knowfor a crime neither of them had committed. McMillian was exonerated in 1993.  The stark racial disparity is also present in sexual assault cases. According to the report, a black person serving time for sexual assault is 3.5 times more likely to be innocent than a white person serving time for the same crime. Black men were responsible for 13 percent of sexual assault cases involving white victims, but 57 percent of sexual assault exonerees involving a white victim were black. The reason? Mistaken eyewitness identification: White people are more likely to mistake one black person for another than they are to misidentify members of their own race.  In 1982, Marvin Anderson was convicted of sexual assault, kidnapping, and robbery after a white woman was brutally raped by a black man in Hanover County, Virginia. When the woman reported the assault to an officer, he immediately suspected Anderson because the rapist told his victim that he \"had a white girl,\" and Anderson was the only black man the cop knew who lived with a white woman. Anderson had no criminal record, so police obtained a copy of Anderson's employment identification, which had a photograph of Anderson in color. Police showed this photograph to the victim alongside black-and-white mug shots of other men. The victim picked Anderson from the photo spread and from a police lineup later in the day. Anderson wasn't vindicated until 2001, when post-conviction DNA testing proved his innocence.  Although the rate of drug use by white and black Americans is similar, black people are five times as likely to go to prison for drug crimes than their white counterparts. This disparity carries over to wrongful convictions as well. Innocent black people are 12 times as likely to be convicted of a drug crime as innocent white people. But because efforts to exonerate innocent people are focused on convictions where the stakes are higher, such as rape or murder, many innocent defendants convicted of low-level drug crimes are never exonerated.  In addition to the 2,000 exonerations that have occurred since 1989, an additional 1,800 people have been vindicated through \"group exonerations.\" These exonerations came after major police scandals, where cops who systematically framed innocent black people were exposed. In 2016, in East Cleveland, Ohio, more than 40 defendants' convictions were overturned after three police officers were imprisoned for planting drugs, stealing money, and filing false search warrants. Unfortunately, most wrongful convictions are never discovered.  \"Increasingly, police, prosecutors and judges recognize this problem,\" O'Brien noted in the press release. \"But will we do enough to actually address it? That remains to be seen.\"", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/black-people-more-likely-wrongfully-convicted", "title": "Black People Are More Likely to Go to Prison for Crimes They Didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat Commit"}, {"text": "Late Wednesday night, the Washington Post broke the news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had twice met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential campaign, contacts he failed to disclose during his Senate confirmation hearings. \"I did not have communications with the Russians,\" said Sessions during his sworn testimony. As a growing list of lawmakers call for Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 electionand some Democrats demand his resignationan open question remains: Can Jeff Sessions be prosecuted for perjury?  The answer is not exactly cut and dry. At the time of his confirmation hearings, Sessions was still serving as a senator from Alabama. The Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause shields lawmakers from prosecution for lying during proceedings in the House or Senate. The clause was written with the intent to foster debate in Congress without the threat of lawsuits stifling discussion. So, since Sessions was a sitting Senator when he allegedly misled Congress, does that mean he's off the hook? Mother Jones put the question to three constitutional law experts.  \"There might be other things he can be prosecuted for,\" says Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Cornell University, referencing laws that allow Congress to hold individuals in contempt for providing false testimony. But, says Chafetz, Sessions can't be prosecuted for perjury.  Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe sees it differently. \"That would be a laughable misuse of the Speech and Debate Clause,\" he says. \"He was testifying under oath as an [attorney general] nominee, not in the discharge of any Senatorial business of his own.\"  Yale Law professor Bruce Ackerman says he's inclined to believe that Sessions is not protected by the clause. Still, Ackerman says there's no decisive case law on the issue, which muddies the waters. \"Only one thing is clear,\" he says, \"Sessions must recuse himself, and it is incumbent on the Administration to appoint a special prosecutor.\"", "date": "2017/03/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/can-jeff-sessions-be-prosecuted-perjury", "title": "Can Jeff Sessions Be Prosecuted for Perjury?"}, {"text": "Sheriff David A.

Neil Gorsuch's confirmation hearings are still weeks away, but Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for what could be an epic showdown over the Supreme Court nominee. Mere hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died last February, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted that the vacant seat should be filled by the next president, rather than the sitting one. Republicans refused even to hold a hearing for Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, effectively stealing the seat in the view of many Democrats. Last week, President Donald Trump announced Gorsuch, a conservative appellate court judge, as his choice to fill the vacancy. Some Democratspushed by constituents and liberal groupsare calling for a filibuster to block the appointment. Trump responded on Wednesday, urging McConnell to \"go nuclear\" if Democrats attempt to filibuster Gorsuch.  As the Senate and the president careen toward a major political fight, here's what you need to know about the Supreme Court, the filibuster, and the so-called \"nuclear option.\"  What is a filibuster, and how is it used?  You're probably aware that there are 100 members of the US Senate and that it (theoretically) takes a majoritygenerally 51 votes, unless someone isn't votingto pass legislation and approve presidential appointments. Simple, right? Not exactly. The Senate's rules also make it possible for a minority of senators to prevent a vote from occurring, effectively killing a bill or a Supreme Court nomination. This is called a filibuster.  There are a couple ways to use the filibuster. In the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington version, a senator will stand on the floor and \"debate\" for as long as possible to prevent a vote from taking place. The late Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) holds the record for the longest filibuster; he spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Modern filibusters tend to be less dramatic. In order to end debate on a matter and proceed to a final vote, Senate rules generally require a supermajoritythat is, 60 membersto first agree to what is known as a cloture motion. By voting against cloture, a minority of senators can prevent the body from taking action. There are currently 52 GOP senators, which means that even if every Republican voted for cloture, they would still need the support of eight Democrats to break a filibuster.  What is the nuclear option?  The ability to filibuster legislation and Supreme Court appointments has persisted for so long in part because the Senate's rules are difficult to change. It takes a two-thirds vote to amend the rules, and it's been half a century since either party controlled two-thirds of the Senate. But the majority party has anothermuch more controversialoption at its disposal: the nuclear option. Rather than change the Senate's rules, Republicans could simply decide to reinterpret existing rules, an action that would require just 51 votes. In essence, a bare majority of senators could declare that 60 votes are not in fact needed to end debate and proceed to a vote on Gorsuch's nomination. What's more, this wouldn't be a one-time exception: It would set a new precedent that kills the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.  Why is it called the \"nuclear option\"?  The term was originally a reference to the expected impact on the Senate's ability to function if the majority party overrides the rules and ends the filibuster. In short, the relationship between the parties might break down, and the body could (figuratively) blow up. During George W. Bush's presidency, Republicans threatened to get rid of the filibuster if Democrats continued to block Bush's appellate court nominees. Democrats responded by issuing their own threat: If Republicans banned the filibuster, Democrats would essentially shut down Senate operations. (Former GOP Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi was apparently the first to refer to the proposal as the \"nuclear option.\" Republicans later decided it would be more popular if they called it the \"constitutional option,\" but the original name stuck.)  Ultimately, a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of 14, reached a compromise. The 2005 deal allowed for three of Bush's nominees to come to an up-or-down vote while letting the Democrats block two others. As part of the bargain, the Republicans agreed not to support the nuclear option, and the Democrats agreed not to filibuster judicial nominees except under \"extraordinary circumstances\"a term that was left undefined.  Has the nuclear option ever actually been used?  Yes, very recently. In 2013, Democrats eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominations so that Obama's executive and lower-court appointments could be confirmed with a simple majority of votes. Democrats finally went nuclear after Republicans filibustered a number of Obama's nomineeseven some of his picks for obscure federal agencies. The new precedent contained one big exception: It didn't eliminate the ability to filibuster Supreme Court nominees.  Despite warnings from Republicans that the move would blow up the Senate, the GOP didn't retaliate in a major way. Republicans won back control of the Senate in the 2014 election, taking the issue temporarily off the table.  So what happens now?  Republicans know they'll face a tough battle if the filibuster remains intact and Democrats attempt to use it to block Gorsuch. Even if all 52 Republicans support Gorsuch, they would still need to persuade eight Democrats to vote for cloture. In a recent interview with CNN, McConnell wouldn't say whether he'll \"go nuclear,\" as Trump has suggested, but he hasn't taken the option off the table. If he does opt to trigger the nuclear option, it would be an extension of what Democrats did in 2013, except now Supreme Court nominees would be included in the precedent. This would allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority vote, leaving Democrats essentially powerless to block him.  What would be the repercussions for the Senate if Republicans use the nuclear option?  The Senate's ability to compromise and work across the aisle has been declining for years, leading to more gridlockwhich is the No. 1 reason the American public is critical of Congress. Using the nuclear option to push through Gorsuch's nomination probably wouldn't do much to rebuild trust between the parties, but it might make the Senate look more productive.  More significantly, if the judicial filibuster is killed, Trump would be able to make future Supreme Court appointments without worrying about pushback from Democrats. And since Democrats have little hope of regaining control of the Senate in 2018, Trump would essentially have a free hand to fill any vacancies for the next four years. That could be a big deal: Three justices (two liberals and one swing vote) are currently 78 or older, so the nuclear option could potentially give Trump the ability to reshape the court for decades to come.  What will the Democrats actually do?  That's still unclear. Democrats remain divided on whether or not they'll actually attempt to filibuster Gorsuch. Like Gorsuch, Scalia was extremely conservative, so Gorsuch's appointment wouldn't alter the previous balance of the court. Some Senate Democrats want to let Gorsuch go through the normal nomination process. That way, they argue, Republicans won't immediately kill the filibuster, and Democrats will still have the option of attempting to block a future Supreme Court nomination if one of the liberal justices steps down or dies during Trump's presidency. As CNN explains, \"Preserving the filibuster now could give Democrats more leverage in the future, proponents of this strategy say.\"  Other Democrats, however, are ready to filibuster. They point to the GOP's treatment of Garland, and they would likely have the support of liberal activists, who are urging Democratic lawmakers to fight Trump at every opportunity. \"This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said in a statement last week. \"And I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the Court.\"", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/nuclear-option-trump-senate-neil-gorsuch", "title": "Trump Wants to Use the \"Nuclear Option\" to Confirm His Supreme Court Pick.

This week, the Pew Research Center released a report entitled \"Behind the Badge,\" a comprehensive survey of nearly 8,000 law enforcement officials across the United States examining their attitudes toward their jobs, police protests, interactions with their communities, racial issues, and much more. The report states that it is appearing \"at a crisis point in America's relationship with the men and women who enforce its laws, precipitated by a series of deaths of black Americans during encounters with the police.\"  According to 2016 University of Louisville and University of South Carolina study, police fatally shoot black men at disproportionate rates. Since the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the last few years have been marked with protests leading to a national discussion around race and policing. This report explores how law enforcement officers in the United States view the intersection of policing and raceoften, not surprisingly, with very different perspectives between white and black officers.  Here are some of the highlights:  Racial equality: When asked about racial inequality in the country, 92 percent of white officers answered that the United States does not need to make any more changes to achieve equal rights for black Americans. Only 29 percent of black cops agreed. This is in sharp contrast to white civilians, the report notes: Only 57 percent of white adults believe that equal rights have been secured for black people; a mere 8 percent of black people agree, Pew found in a separate survey.

Police involvement in immigrant deportation: During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump supported local law enforcement having more of a role in deporting undocumented immigrants, and a small majority of cops agree. Overall, 52 percent of police officers believe they should have an active role in immigration enforcement; 59 percent of white cops agree, compared with 35 percent of black officers and 38 percent of Hispanic police officers.

Community policing: The idea of training police officers to work with community members to achieve better policing has become the center of the conversation surrounding police reform since President Barack Obama organized a task force around the \"community policing\" concept. But 56 percent of all police officers interviewed consider an aggressive approach to policing more appropriate in certain neighborhoods than the approach of being courteous. There was no racial breakdown for this result.

Physical confrontation: For most police officers, according to the report, physical confrontations do not occur every day, but one-third of those interviewed reported having a physical struggle with a suspect who was resisting arrest within the last month. Thirty-six percent of white officers reported having such an incident, while 33 percent of Hispanic officers reported the same thing. Only 20 percent of black officers said they had a physical altercation with a suspect.  The report also includes police officers attitudes on job satisfaction and police reform proposals. \"Police and the public hold sharply different views about key aspects of policing as well as on some major policy issues facing the country,\" the report concludes.

As it was later revealed, the 22-year-old Roof was a white supremacist. After an eight-day trial in the Charleston federal district court, on December 15 the jury found Roof guilty of all 33 federal countsincluding hate crimes and obstruction of exercise of religion18 of which carry the federal death penalty. This week, after less than three hours of deliberation, the jury sentenced Roof to death, making him the 63rd person who will be held on federal death row.  Federal law classifies the jury's decision as a binding \"recommendation,\" which means, according to Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, \"there's likely a decade worth of appeals.\" Roof could be well into his 30s before he is executed.  He likely will not be executed at all, because a federal death sentence often does not result in a lethal injection. To be eligible for federal death row, the defendant's crime has to have a national angle, such as bombing a federal building. Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in 2015 for his role in the 2013 attack, but his appeals process is likely to extend for years. Today, 23 people on death row have exhausted their appeals and are eligible to be executed. Three co-defendants who have been on federal death row for the longest period of time were convicted in a series of drug-related murders: Richard Tipton, Corey Johnson, and James H. Roane Jr. have been awaiting execution since 1993.  Contrast this with executions on the state level. Between 1988, when the federal death penalty was reinstated, and 2016, the government only put three inmates to death. States have carried out 1,439 executions since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment does not violate the Constitution. Gulf War veteran Louis Jones Jr. was the last person to be executed by the government, in 2003, for the kidnapping, rape, and murder of 19-year-old Tracie McBride. His was a federal case because the 1995 crime took place on the federal property of a US Air Force base.  There have been no federal executions during President Barack Obama's two terms. Obama's efforts to reduce the federal prison population during his presidency and his discomfort with the death penalty, which he described as \"deeply troubling,\" coincided with the long appeals process and recent questions about the efficacy of lethal injection drugs. The effect was a halt to federal executions. Nationwide support for capital punishment has been dropping steadily over the last two decades. Today, only 49 percent of Americans support the death penalty for murderers, down from 80 percent in 1994. Among Republican voters, however, 72 percent support the death penalty for violent murderers.  President-elect Donald Trump is one of those death penalty supporters. On the campaign trail in December 2015, Trump announced that as president, he would sign an executive order mandating the death penalty for convicted cop killers. As attorney general, Jeff Sessionswho has supported the death penaltycould move this pledge forward by addressing a number of institutional and practical problems that have been obstacles to federal executions.  \"It takes a long time and it takes a lot of money to execute folks.\"  \"It takes a long time and it takes a lot of money to execute folks,\" says Monica Foster, a lawyer whose clients include defendants on federal death row. The average cost of defending a federal death penalty case is $620,932. Inmates typically spend more than a decade in the appeals process before entering death row and awaiting execution.  Opponents of capital punishment believe that it's immoral, racially biased, and not a deterrent for crime. Sixty-two percent of those awaiting death in federal prisons are nonwhite. \"The federal death penalty reflects the state penalty system's problems of racial bias, poor lawyering, and unreliable evidence,\" says Miriam Gohora, a law professor at Yale Law School. But Trump's pick for attorney general disagrees. At a 2001 congressional hearing on racial and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty, Sessions stated he was against a moratorium on the federal death penalty for several reasons, one of them being that \"the death penalty deters murder, as studies as recent as this year have found.\" A 2008 Death Penalty Information Center survey published in 2009 found that 88 percent of criminologists do not consider the death penalty a deterrent to violent crime.  \"I would expect that the incoming administration would be more aggressive in seeking the federal death penalty,\" says William Otis a professor of law at Georgetown law school.  If the Trump administration wanted to aggressively pursue the death penalty and carry out more executions, it would have to address the issue of lethal injection drugs. In 2011, the only American manufacturer of lethal injection drugs, Hospira, announced it would no longer produce sodium thiopental, a key ingredient in the serum used to carry out executions. The company originally intended to resume production at its Italian plant, but Italian officials refused to export the drug if it were to be used for executions. Other companies followed suit, leading to a massive shortage. Many states and the federal government were left with no method of execution, forcing a lull in carrying out capital punishments.  Some states sought to use different drug combinations that haven't been widely tested. In Oklahoma, a new drug combination led to the botched execution in 2014 of Clayton Lockett, who writhed and moaned during the procedure. In the wake of this incident, Obama announced that the government, through the Department of Justice, would be reviewing its death penalty protocols leading to an effective moratorium. The move was considered a victory for opponents of the death penalty.  The state of Texas recently sued the Food and Drug Administration over the withholding of a shipment of lethal injection drugs that the FDA maintains are illegal to import because they haven't been tested for safety. \"Drugs used in executions are not supposed to be safethey're supposed to be lethal,\" Otis says, adding that the safety requirements would likely be one of the first areas the Trump administration might seek to change.  In death penalty cases like Dylann Roof's, where there is no question about guilt or innocence, opponents of capital punishment believe that a life sentence without the chance of parole would provide justice. Roof wanted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but federal officials rejected the offer. Many family members of the victims opposed the death penalty for Roof. The morning after the jury decided on its verdict, Judge Richard Gergel formally sentenced Roof to death, saying, \"This trial has produced no winners, only losers.\"", "date": "2017/01/12", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/will-federal-government-actually-execute-dylann-roof", "title": "Why Dylann Roof's Death Sentence May Never Be Carried Out"}, {"text": "Update, 5:10 p.m.: Dylann Roof is the first person in the United States to get the death penalty for committing federal hate crimes.

CoreCivic apparently retained the Alexandria, Virginia-based firm to manage its reputation following the publication of a Mother Jones story in which I detailed my four months working as a corrections officer at a CoreCivic-operated prison in Louisiana.  The prison company's connection to the PR firm came to light through a recent email sent by CoreCivic spokesperson Jonathan Burns to Hillenby chief operating officer Katie Lilley. Burns copied Texas Public Radio reporter Aaron Schrank on the email, presumably unintentionally. Schrank forwarded the email to me. The email suggests that Hillenby has been assisting CoreCivic in developing its public response to my reporting.  A two-page set of talking points, titled \"Get the Facts on Mother Jones ,\" were attached to the message. Burns said he wanted to have the talking points, which CoreCivic originally issued last summer, \"handy\" during a \"Metro Commission meeting,\" and asked Lilley if she could have it \"CoreCivic-ified first,\" referring to the company's recent decision to change its name and logo. The meeting Burns mentioned may be a reference to a meeting in Nashville, where CoreCivic is based and where it has a contract to run the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility.  Hillenby says it helps companies \"incorporate certain language\" in their correspondence with reporters to \"introduce the concept of legal risk.\"  The talking points label me as an \"activist reporter\" who sought to \"force onto Mother Jones readers a rehashed and predetermined premise instead of a factual and informed story.\" The document focuses largely on the fact that I sought employment as a prison guard rather than simply interviewing CoreCivic about their company. It accuses me of having \"jeopardized the safety and security\" of the prison and its employees by writing about the things I had witnessed and experienced there, rather than reporting them to my supervising officer. The memo also criticizes me for neglecting to speak \"to a person supportive of our company and the solutions we provide.\" CoreCivic declined multiple interview requests while I was reporting my article. I also sent the company more than 150 questions seeking responses and further information.  CoreCivic and Hillenby's executives did not respond to requests to comment for this article.  It's unclear what, if any, steps Hillenby has taken to help rebrand CoreCivic. On its website, Hillenby doesn't name many of its clients and describes its campaigns in general terms. The firm claims it has successfully curtailed the publication of investigative reports \"with every national television network, investigative cable news programs and several other print, digital and broadcast outlets, including hardline activist media.\" For example, it claims that its \"aggressive media strategy\" succeeded in pushing an investigative report by an unnamed broadcast company to be \"indefinitely delayed\" and \"likely dropped.\" The firm says it helps companies \"incorporate certain language\" in their correspondence with investigative reporters to \"introduce the concept of legal risk.\"  The PR firm's top executives, Rob Hoppin and Katie Lilley, previously worked at Edelman, one of the world's largest PR firms. Edelman has used controversial strategies while performing corporate facelifts. In 2006, it created Working Families for Walmart, a supposedly grassroots group of Walmart supporters. Its blog posts turned out to have been written by Edelman employees. Edelman also helped organize \"Wal-Marting Across America,\" a blog written by a road-tripping couple who recorded their overwhelmingly positive interactions with Walmart employees. Edelman flew the couple to Las Vegas and furnished them with a mint-green RV adorned with the Working Families for Walmart logo. It's unclear if Hoppin and Lilley worked on those campaigns, though both were on Edelman's Walmart account at the time, according to their online bios.  A few weeks after I stopped working at the prison, in early 2015, CoreCivic notified the Louisiana Department of Corrections that it planned to terminate its contract to operate the facility, which had been set to expire in 2020. According to DOC documents, the state had asked CoreCivic to address numerous issues at the prison involving security, staffing levels, training, programming for inmates, and a bonus paid to Winn's warden that \"causes neglect of basic needs.\" Shortly following the publication of my article last June, the Justice Department announced it would phase out its use of private prisons.", "date": "2017/01/19", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/corecivic-cca-private-prison-pr-firm-hillenby", "title": "A Stray Email Exposes a Prison Company's Rebranding Efforts"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump's first weeks in office, a head-spinning blur of policy shifts and controversial executive orders, has worried criticssome of whom say that a historic emergency is underway.  Politicians like Virginia Rep. Don Beyer and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer have said in recent days that the United States is in the middle of a constitutional crisis. They argue that the Constitution, the framework for the balance of power in government, has failedor at minimum is in jeopardy.  But what does that mean, exactly? How worried should we be?  Mother Jones talked to two constitutional scholars who say we are not yet in a crisis. But their cautious assessments were often peppered with bleak language.  Congress \"is broken. I am not sure if it can be fixed,\" said Ronald Krotoszynski, a professor and expert on constitutional law at the University of Alabama School of Law. We need Congress to play an active oversight rolea check against abuses of executive authority, he said: \"And although the federal courts function very well, they are the weakest branch and simply cannot serve as the only check on lawless executive actions.\"  Meanwhile, Jack Balkin, a Yale Law School professor who has studied constitutional crises, could not think of a similar moment in US history. \"We are in uncharted waters,\" he said.  Here's how Krotoszynski and Balkin view the Trump administration's moves so farand what worries them the most.  What exactly is a constitutional crisis, anyway?  A constitutional crisis occurs when there is a serious danger that the Constitution is about to fail at its central task, which is to keep political disagreements from breaking down into anarchy, violence, or civil war, said Balkin, a Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School.  Krotoszynski, the University of Alabama law professor, gave a broader definition. In a strict sense, he said, it means that we face a situation for which the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, fails to provide a clear answer to a pressing question of governance.  \"In a more general sense, however, it means that one branch of government has gone off the rails,\" he saidthat it's acting in ways inconsistent with the text of the Constitution or well-established constitutional conventions.  How are those definitions different from how people have been talking about constitutional crises of late?  Sometimes when people call something a constitutional crisis, Balkin said, they really mean that there is a heated dispute about how to interpret the Constitution or people are upset at what government officials have done.  And some crises are really what Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet has called \"constitutional hardball,\" Balkin said. This is when political actors stretch or defy unspoken rules of fair play that were not clearly legally required. As an example of this, he cited Senate Republicans' refusal to allow a confirmation hearing for anyone President Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court during his last year in office.  Actions that cannot self-correct through the mechanisms of the branches of government are the most problematic, Krotoszynski said. If a federal court can block or prevent an unlawful action, the president's actions are unlawful, but they do not represent a constitutional crisis.  Could Trump's actions connected to the \"Muslim ban\" executive order lead to a constitutional crisis?  A federal judge in Seattle has issued a nationwide injunction that stops government officials from enforcing Trump's executive order banning people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. The Trump administration says it is following the existing orders from federal judges, which apply to specific jurisdictions as opposed to the entire country. Krotoszynski said it will be interesting to see how the administration responds to this injunction, which has national scopebut we haven't reached constitutional crisis territory on this particular issue. \"Happily, we are not thereat least yet,\" Krotoszynski said.  Balkin said it's important to distinguish between mismanagement and overreach. \"If President Trump ordered executive branch officials to defy judicial ordersand they did so, not merely in isolated instances out of confusion, but deliberately and consistentlythat could precipitate a constitutional crisis.\"  The Justice Department's appeal, filed over the weekend, is not the same as defying the courts, Balkin added.  Are there other actions by Trump that may lead to a constitutional crisis?  Yes, said Krotoszynski, who singled out the executive order telling agencies that they must repeal two regulations for every new one they make as \"the most broadly lawless action\" the administration has taken so far. \"This is insane.\"  Congress writes the laws that tells agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency how to regulate. The 2-for-1 requirement Trump created has effectively rewritten every federal regulatory enactment, Krotoszynski argues. The president can propose bills that amend existing laws, but he cannot amend laws on a whim. This appears to be the net effect of the 2-for-1 regulation, he said.  If agencies pay attention to it, and disregard court orders telling them to take their marching orders from the US Code, then we have a constitutional crisis. \"Congress itself should be up in arms about it,\" Krotoszynski said, \"but isn't.\"  Trump's business holdings, which many experts say is a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, is also an area that could lead to a crisis, he added.  What other moments in American history can be considered constitutional crises that are more serious than the Trump administration actions people are debating now?  The examples cited by Balkin and Krotoszynski were from the nation's darkest days: the Civil War and the years right before and after the signing of the Constitution.  Krotoszynski said 1781 to 1789 was a particularly dark period. \"The Articles of Confederation were a dismal failure and the nation was melting downeconomically and politically,\" Krotoszynski said, referring to the document that was the first Constitution of the United States. The Constitution of 1787 was a \"Hail Mary\" effort to reboot the government, he said.  \"The Constitution broke down at the end of 1860, resulting in the deaths of approximately 2 percent of the population of the country,\" Balkin said, adding that would be roughly the equivalent of 6 million people today.

ACA literally sustains millions of lives . Without the health insurance it provides, many people wouldn't have access to medicine and procedures that they need to survive. When we asked people on Twitter and through healthcare advocacy organizations to share their stories of how ACA keeps them alive, we were overwhelmed with responses. We heard from people waiting for organ transplants, from cancer survivors, from people with debilitating mental illness, and more. They told us about the toll that disease has taken on their lives: Before the ACA, some were forced to skip treatments because of the price; others couldn't get insurance at all because they were already sick. Here are a few of their stories.  Claudette Williams, 58, Orlando, Florida: I lost my job in 2005. After that I decided to purchase a policy. I found them online. They had a gentleman come to my house, and we talked about my blood pressure medications. The insurance was almost twice what they had quoted me because of the medication, and also because of my condition. I eventually couldn't afford it any more. I was uninsured, except for one year when I qualified for Medicaid. I ended up in the emergency room on a few occasions for heart trouble. I also developed diabetes. I couldn't afford to have regular mammograms. In 2014 I signed up for Obamacare. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September of last year. The lumpectomy alone was billed at $40,000. I have four more chemo sessions to go, and after that, I have to do radiation. Luckily my cancer is only a stage one, so my prognosis is pretty good. But it is really scary thinking about my insurance being taken away. This is a fight for my life.  Charis Hill, 30, California: When I was 25, in 2012, I had a series of unexplained and undiagnosable respiratory challenges that felt like the flu or bronchitis or pneumonia. Doctors just couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. My condition got worse and worse. I visited urgent care a few times. I thought I was having a heart attack once. They tried to blame it on anxiety.  As hard as I fight to be healthy, I'm never going to be healthy, and I'm always going to have to rely on the medical system to keep me alive.  Eventually reached out to my dad, who was estranged from me. I knew that he had a severe health condition. The first words out of his mouth were, it sounds like you have what I have, which is ankylosing spondylitis (AS). I knew that I would need health insurance to be treated. But if I were to get a diagnosis before getting health insurance, I would have the preexisting condition working against me. So I got the cheapest plan that existed. I wasn't getting all the tests done or getting all the treatments. Then, ten months later, the ACA was implemented, and because of my income, I was eligible for a subsidy to purchase health insurance on the exchange in California. I got a better plan for less than I was paying before, which meant that I could access more treatment and not skip medication.  I have infusions of a drug every eight weeks. I have to go to an infusion center for 2.5 hours. There's no generic. There's no way to get those treatments unless I have insurance. They slow down the progression of my disease. I also take anti-inflammatory medications orally. AS is a severe inflammatory condition. It primarily affects the spine. It causes a lot of pain and fatigue from the body trying to fight that inflammation. I'm permanently disabled. I was a college athlete, and now I'm not even able to run. I use a wheelchair sometimes. As hard as I fight to be healthy, I'm never going to be healthy, and I'm always going to have to rely on the medical system to keep me alive.  John Weiler, 27, Oakland, California: I got HIV when I was 19. When I was in college, I was on my parents health insurance, so when I started meds when I was 21, I took it for granted that I was going to have insurance that would cover it, because it was so easy. When I went to grad school, I naively accepted a position without asking any questions about how the insurance was structured. When you do a science PhD, it's typical for the school to pay your tuition, pay your health insurance premium, and give you a stipend. In my program, the stipend is about $30,000 a year. So when I enrolled and started to look at my insurance situation, I realized the policy offered to students provided up to $10,000 worth of prescription coverage per academic year, and that was it. But in 2013, the student government got together and petitioned the university to change across the UC system. The students basically said, 'We don't care if our insurance premiums are higher, we don't want these things that the ACA offers to not be part of the insurance plan for the school.'  I was on a med cocktail called Complera, and that one was $22,000 a year. HIV meds are super expensive. I switched to a different medication since then, called Stribild, and I don't know exactly what it is this year, but if I remember correctly, that one was closer to $27,000 a year.  I'm about to graduate and find a job, and, let's say worst case scenario, first Congressional session they manage to totally gut the ACA and revert to how things were before. If that were to happen and I were to get a job, it would be totally legal for an employer to be like, 'Hey, yeah, we're not covering this.' I'd be looking at close to $35,000 a year in medical expenses just for maintenance, let alone if I got sick.  Ruth Linehan, 26, Portland, Oregon: I graduated college in May 2012. I was 22. About a month later, I started an internship as a software developer at a Portland startup. Thanks to ACA I was on my parents' insurance. After four months I was offered a full time job, but the insurance didn't start until 6 weeks after my first day as an employee. On my first day I was diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma. I looked like I was 7 months pregnant. I started chemo the day after I was hospitalized. This is an incredibly fast-growing cancer. I was in the hospital for seven weeks. I received about four rounds of chemo. After four months I was declared in remission. I continue to be in remission. The hospital bills were about half a million dollars. I only had to pay about $10,000 because I was on my parents' insurance.  If I lose my job and the cancer comes back, what am I going to do? I worry about illness down the road. I've had cancer at a very young age and a lot of very harsh chemo. I worry that I won't be able to get affordable insurance, or get insurance at all.  Larry Sterlingshires, 35, Tennessee: I have a condition called hidradenitis surruptivalook it up, do not look at pictures, because it's not a good timeit's a chronic skin condition that's ultimately debilitating. As it progresses, it causes tissue degradation on the skin layer that doesn't heal, like normal wounds do. Sometimes it creates lesions that don't heal for a year and half. It's debilitating because it's painfulthe tissue underneath is exposed without that protective layer, so it bleeds regularly. You have to keep everything patched and bandaged, and it easily gets infected. But because of the ACA, I can have medication that can't completely undo the symptoms, but it seems to have halted its progression, and even promoted some healing. Complications related to the tissue damage and infections can be fatal.  You can imagine the fear I havebeing so close to getting a transplantthat they might repeal the ACA right away, and I will no longer have access to insurance, and I won't be able to get my transplant.  The medications I'm on right now, in addition to just my normal medications for diabetes and hypertension, will help me survive longer. This lets me afford something called Claravis, and another medication called Humira. Humira runs approximately $7300 a month, and the Claravis is about $4000 a month. Those basically keep me functional without being completely disabled. That's no exaggeration. If you check the disability schedule, it's so painful and considered debilitating enough that you can qualify for full disability with it. The Affordable Care Act covers all of that medication in full. I come from poverty, I'm just now getting used to having insurance for the first time in my adult life, and now that seems like it might evaporate.  Debbie Lynn Smith, 59, Las Vegas, Nevada: I was a TV writer and producer. In 2000 I was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans. It's also called popcorn lung. I got it from buttered popcorn. When you work in TV, you work 15 hour days. They provide snacks and things. Microwave popcorn is one of the things they give you. I ate a lot of it. It just so happened that I was susceptible to this disease.  I was in remission for 16 years, but I was living with 50 percent of my lung capacity. I couldn't do TV anymore, couldn't put in those long hours. I really had a hard time working and being reliable because I would get sick. So I couldn't get insurance through work. I had insurance through the high-risk California program and I was paying $2,000 a month for that. My husband was on it, too, he had prostate cancer. We moved to Nevada. When the ACA came around we were ecstatic. We were both out of work at the time, so we went on ACA.  This year, in April, my disease came out of remission. I am now down to 30 percent of my lung capacity and waiting for a lung transplant. So you can imagine the fear I havebeing so close to getting a transplantthat they might repeal the ACA right away, and I will no longer have access to insurance, and I won't be able to get my transplant. I am extremely stressed. I was so stressed before the election that I could not take anything else. I was working for Hillary and I ended up in the hospital.  Michele Munro, 64, Southern California: I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. I was 44. I was a single mom with two boys. I had Kaiser insurance. It wasn't a bad cancer, and we caught it early. Then seven years later I was diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer. That was 2004. I also had a hip replacement. The Kaiser premium doubled, so I went without insurance for the first time in years. I was working as a freelancer, and insurers told me I was uninsurable. In 2011, ACA started to kick in. It was not allowing insurance companies to consider preexisting conditions. I applied and was accepted into Aetna. The first thing I did was go for a mammogram, and, sure enough, I had a triple-negative tumor. Very aggressive. It was small and early, so we caught it just in time. I had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and breast reconstruction, all covered through ACA. I went into the hospital seven times total for infections. The billing was $900,000. Aetna settled and paid out $180,000.  I exercise a lot. I'm doing everything I can on my end. But there is only so much you can do. I'm scared for myself, and also for my children.  I'm feeling really good right now because December was the fifth anniversary of being cancer-free. I exercise a lot. I'm doing everything I can on my end. But there is only so much you can do. I'm scared for myself, and also for my children. My parents had to claim bankruptcy for health insurance reasons. They were not covered for a medical emergency.  Suzanna Moore, 29, Fairfield, Iowa: When I was a baby, I had a stroke. I recovered well, but I would always have issues afterward. Throughout my childhood, it always a concern if I would have proper health care. I grew up in a pretty poor family in New England. With Obamacare, I went to an orthopedist for the first time in forever and got a prescription for orthotics to alleviate chronic pain in my knees and ankles on one side, because my right side was affected more from the stroke than my left side. The pain built up for a while, but basically throughout my twenties, I was never able to get it addressed, because I was living on my own in Tennessee and was unable to focus any money toward my personal health care.  I also had a meniscus tear during that time. Had I had surgery on that on my own, it would have been like $15,000 or more. With Obamacare, we still had to prioritize, but we didn't go in debt over it.  My husband has a rare condition called achalasia, which means the muscles in his throat stopped working the way they were supposed to, so he had trouble swallowing and eating. He had to force food down his esophagus with air and water. After a while, it got so painful that he was eating less and he was losing weight rapidly. It was hindering his quality of life, and, left untreated, it could contribute to throat cancer. So he had to have surgery about eight months after I had my knee surgery. We were able to afford all of it. We wouldn't have been able to do that without Obamacare.", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/obamacare-saved-my-life", "title": "8 People Who Owe Their Lives to Obamacare"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump has thrown his full weight behind the House Republicans' plan to overturn Obamacare. But he might end up regretting that move in 2020. That's because many of the bill's most disruptive changes would take effect just as he's launching his bid for reelection.  So far, the White House has been one of the chief proponents of the controversial legislation. \"This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor, this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is, this is the plan,\" he said this week. \"And we're going to have a tremendous, I think we're going to have a tremendous success. It's a complicated process, but actually it's very simple: It's called good health care.\" At a meeting with members of Congress Tuesday, Trump stressed the urgency of passing the new bill, saying that the GOP would face an electoral \"bloodbath\" if they couldn't enact an Obamacare repeal before the 2018 midterms.  If the early days of the Trump presidency are any guide, policy implementation doesn't appear to be this administration's strong suit.  Of course, there's more than one way to spark a political bloodbath. When Trump gets ready to dive into his reelection campaign, he could face a crumbling health care system in the middle of turbulent changes. Many of the major provisions in the GOP bill won't go into effect immediately. Instead, key Obamacare policies would sunset in early 2020with major changes to Medicaid, tax credits, and the individual insurance marketplace all kicking in right around the time Democrats are battling it out in the Iowa caucuses.  If there's one lesson to learn from Obama's Affordable Care Act, it's that major overhauls of the health care market inevitably won't go as smoothly as predicted. And if the early days of the Trump presidency are any guide, policy implementation doesn't appear to be this administration's strong suit.  Republicans regularly complained that the Affordable Care Act was structured so that former President Barack Obama wouldn't have to face the consequences of the bill until after his 2012 reelection campaign; the full rollout of the program didn't take place until several years after Obama signed the 2010 bill into law. When the insurance marketplaces finally launched in the fall of 2013with a disastrous rollout that created public outrageObama had long since secured his second term.  Republicans apparently aren't going to provide Trump with that kind of cover. For example, the biggest changes to Medicaid in the GOP's proposal will kick in at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.  One of Obamacare's most successful measures for boosting the insurance rolls has been Medicaid expansion, which allows states to enroll everyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level into the government insurance program. The federal government largely foots the bill for these new enrollees. According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, in the 31 states that have participated in this program, more than 11 million people joined the Medicaid program thanks to the new, more generous eligibility requirements.  Under the Republican repeal bill, those states wouldn't immediately lose funding for this larger universe of possible Medicaid recipients. Rather, they'll receive the same level of federal funding until_January 1, 2020. At that point, states will no longer get funding to add new people to the program, and anyone who drops from the Medicaid rolls for more than a month will be excluded thereafter.  Health care costs can be pretty unpredictable, so Trump better hope none of those unexpected spikes hit swing states in 2020.  Also beginning in 2020, the overall structure of Medicaid funding will change. Currently, the feds promise to pay for a set percentage of state medical costs through the program. It's an open-ended guarantee: If a state sees a huge spike in the cost of health care in any given year, the federal government will automatically step in to help cover those extra costs.  But under the GOP's new plan, there would be a cap on how much the feds contribute to state Medicaid spending (an amount that will vary widely between states). According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group, states would lose $116 billion in federal contributions over the next decade because of that change. Some states will undoubtedly see their Medicaid costs rise above the new cap, leaving state governments scrambling to either find more funding or to cut benefits. Health care costs can be pretty unpredictable, so Trump better hope none of those unexpected spikes hit swing states in 2020.  People who buy their insurance through the individual marketplaces will also experience a major shift starting in 2020. Before Obamacare, it could be incredibly difficult for someone trying to purchase insurance as an individual to figure out what plans actually covered. Frequently, consumers would realize only after getting sick that their plan could leave them with large out-of-pocket costs. But now, if you visit HealthCare.gov to pick out a health plan, options are grouped into tiers based on how generous the benefits are. Obamacare created a system of simple language to make those differences clear: Bronze plans generally have the lowest premiums and least generous benefits, silver and gold plans are in the middle, and platinum plans are expensive but have the best coverage. Not every silver plan is identical, but they should each cover a similar percentage of the costs for most patients.  The Republicans' plan will erase those clear designations starting in 2020. Consumers will once again have to wade through the plans' details and attempt to judge the relative merits of each option without clear-cut guidelines. \"This could muddle what is already a difficult process for plan shoppers,\" writes Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, in the journal Health Affairs.  At the same time Obamacare's tiers are wiped out, the GOP legislation would also roll out a new scheme for helping consumers pay for insurance. Currently, the government offers subsidies to anyone making up to 400 percent of the poverty line. That assistance varies based on income and region (with more aid given to people in places where insurance is more expensive).  Trump might have to explain to a lot of older and poorer voters why they're suddenly getting less help when they purchase health insurance.  The Republican plan ditches the Obamacare subsidies and replaces them with refundable tax credits that are solely based on the recipient's age for individuals earning less than $75,000 per year and families earning less than $150,000. (The tax credits decline for people earning more than that.) For middle-class families, the GOP plan will offer more assistance. But low-income people and those who live in regions where health care costs moregenerally rural areaswill get less help from the government than under the current system.  The Kaiser Family Foundation put together a handy tool earlier this week that compares the current subsidies with those under the new GOP plan. For example, under Obamacare, a 60-year-old who lives in Iowa's Poweshiek County and makes $30,000 a year would have received $11,270 in subsidies in 2020. Under the Republican bill, that same 60-year-old would get $4,000 in government help. Across the country, these reductions will hit the poor, older people, and rural communities the hardest. So Trump might have to explain to a lot of older and poorer voters why they're suddenly getting less help when they purchase health insurance.  Maybe that's why Trump has begun to subtly shift his position. During a White House meeting Wednesday night with members of various conservative groups who have objected to the slow pace of the Obamacare repeal in the GOP proposal, Trump reportedly hinted that he'd be fine with speeding up the process so that the changes to Medicaid expansion take place in 2018 instead of 2020. That would give the insurance market a bit more time to settle before Trump has to face the electorate.  On the other hand, it would give congressional Republicans one more reason to worry about a bloodbath in 2018.", "date": "2017/03/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/donald-trump-2020-reelection-obamacare-republicans", "title": "Republicans Just Made Trump's Reelection a Whole Lot Tougher"}, {"text": "Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), right, and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), at a news conference on the American Health Care Act, the House Republican's plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, March 7, 2017.  Democrats are mucking up the GOP's plans for a smooth, quick process of repealing Obamacareand their strategy seems to be to annoy Republicans as much as possible with legislative arcana.  Two House committees kicked off their hearings on the Republican replacement health care bill Wednesday morning, a quick turnaround given that Republicans didn't even release their bill until Monday evening, after keeping it under lock and key last week. At the House Energy & Commerce Committee, Democrats quickly derailed proceedings with objections and parliamentary inquiries. Rep. Frank Pallone (N.J.), the top Democrat on the committee, regularly interrupted the committee's chairman, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), to object to the rushed legislative process.  Most of Pallone's proposals didn't go anywhere; they just dragged things out with arguments over procedure. His request to give members longer than a minute for their opening statements was turned down by Walden, and his motion for a 30-day delay on the hearing was rejected in a party-line vote.  Finally, an hour and a half into the hearing, the committee was all set to delve into the substance of the bill and begin debating its provisions and offering amendments. Not so fast, Rep. Ben Lujn (D-N.M.) objected. He wanted a full reading of the bill. While Republicans are fond of pointing out how much shorter their plan is than the Affordable Care Act, it's still a lengthy, technical document, and reading it out loud would take quite a while.  \"We've been told to expect to be here through the weekend,\" Walden warned, saying there'd be many long nights of hearings thanks to the many amendments Democrats intend to propose.  While most of these legislative machinations seem intended solely to pester Republicans, they're not just empty maneuvering. Thanks to the fast turnaround from the bill's release to its markup, the Congressional Budget Office hasn't had time to calculate how much the bill will cost or how many people will lose their health insurance. If the Democrats can drag things out so that the committee doesn't vote on the bill until next week, that might buy the CBO enough time to offer an assessment before committee members cast their votes. And Democrats likely hope that they can prevent the bill from getting a full House vote before the Easter recess next month, forcing Republicans to confront their constituents before the bill gets a full vote.", "date": "2017/03/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/democrats-are-trying-annoy-hell-out-republicans-health-care-bill", "title": "Democrats' Health Care Strategy: Annoy the Hell Out of Republicans"}, {"text": "Republicans' effort to reform health care is already pissing off one of their core constituencies: old people.

The GOP's plan would bump that ratio up to 5-to-1. (Older people are generally riskier to insure and spend more on health care.)  The AARP isn't a fan of that change, calling it an \"age tax\" and describing it as a hand out to big insurance companies. \"No, I don't think that's fair either, Charlie,\" the man tells his squirrel friend.

This legislation is a little over 100 pages, and every American can read and understand it.

Last week, they kept the bill under guard by Capitol Hill police so that only Republican House members could read the language. That sent Democrats scrambling to figure out what was in the bill. Even Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) went on a stunt chase to try to get access to the bill.  House Republicans finally released the text of the plan on Monday night. Then they scheduled two simultaneous markup hearings for Wednesday morning, less than 48 hours after the release of the bill and almost certainly before the Congressional Budget Office will have had time to conduct an analysis to see how many people would lose or gain insurance under the proposal and how much it will cost taxpayers. After those hearings, Republicans hope to push the bill to a quick vote on both the House and Senate floors before a recess scheduled for next month.

But a band of four Republican senators had already begun revolting in publiceven before the language of the new measure had seen the light of day. They sent a letter to their caucus leader Monday afternoon saying that they couldn't support the latest leaked version of the House plans because it doesn't protect people who gained Medicaid under Obamacare.  One of the Affordable Care Act's most effective ways of lowering the number of people who lack health insurance has been a provision that allows those who earn 138 percent or less of the federal poverty level to enroll in Medicaid. The Supreme Court added a level of uncertainty to this implementation by allowing states to decide whether or not they want to opt into that program, but 31 states have accepted Medicaid expansion to date, granting government-covered insurance to about 11 million additional people.  Republican Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (West Virginia), Cory Gardner (Colorado), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday voicing their concerns. \"While we support efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and make structural reforms to the Medicaid program,\" the letter says, \"we are concerned that the February 10th draft proposal from the House of Representatives does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion programs or the necessary flexibility for states.\"  The four senators all hail from states that have accepted Medicaid expansion, and they made that necessary prerequisite for any plan they'd be willing to consider. \"We will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,\" the letter explains.  This early warning spells serious trouble for Republican hopes of repealing Obamacare. Republicans plan to pass their repeal bill through a budget reconciliation process in which only a simple majority is necessary, so they don't have to worry about a Democratic filibuster. But with just 52 Republican senators (and few possible Democratic defections), Republicans probably can't pass a bill without these four senators.

That decision would presumably be left to acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente.  The hastily called press conference came as lawmakers from both parties called for Sessions to recuse himself from any investigations into Russia's role in the election. During Sessions' confirmation hearing, Sen.

As reporters waited for Sessions to begin his press conference at DOJ headquarters Thursday, televisions tuned to CNN replayed the exchange with Frankenfollowed by a segment with the chyron, \"Calls grow for attorney general to resign.\"  When he took the podium shortly after 4 p.m., Sessions claimed that he was innocent of any wrongdoing and had not purposefully misled the Senate during his confirmation hearing. \"My reply to the question of Sen.

Sessions also said he and Kislyak had discussed a visit Sessions paid to a Russian church in 1991 and that Kislyak had told him he was not religious. \"I thought he was pretty much an old-style Soviet ambassador,\" Sessions said.

Tax collections have regularly come in far below expectations in recent years, leaving Kansas lawmakers scrambling to slash government services in order to comply with a state law requiring a balanced budget. (Most states, unlike the federal government, have balanced budget requirements.)  After a wave of moderate Republicans and Democrats won in last November's election by campaigning against Brownback's tax cuts, it looked like Brownback's policies could be repealed. Two weeks ago, the state House and Senate voted to increase the state income tax (though not all the way back to the pre-Brownback levels) and to end an exemption that allowed certain classes of business owners to zero-out their state income tax. But Brownback vetoed the bill. The House managed to cobble together the two-thirds majority to override the governor's veto, but the Senate fell three votes shy of overruling Brownback.  Credit rating agency Moody's isn't a fan of Brownback's veto. According to the Topeka Capital-Journal, Moody's issued a statement Monday warning that the state could see its rating downgraded as a result of lawmakers' continued inability to find a permanent solution to the lack of revenue. \"With the state for now sticking with a lower-tax policy,\" the statement said, \"Kansas will continue to struggle to balance its budget, consider deferring pension contributions again, and drain its highway fund of funding for crucial transportation projects.\"  If Moody's follows through on the threat, it wouldn't be the first time Kansas got a credit downgrade thanks to Brownback. Last year, both Moody's and S&P lowered their ratings for the state, after having previously done so in 2014. Moody's gave Kansas a negative outlook for the future last year, and S&P said: \"The downgrade reflects what we believe to be structural budget pressures.\"", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sam-brownback-kansas-tax-cuts-moody-credit-rating", "title": "Even Wall Street Thinks Sam Brownback's Policies Are a Disaster"}, {"text": "As Republicans try to balance their promise to repeal Obamacare with the health law's increasing popularity, one GOP lawmaker employed a novel argument on Thursday: If fewer people are insured under the Republican replacement plan, that's simply a sign of greater freedom.  For one of the central policy fights facing Congress, health care reform won't get much discussion at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual Republican confab held just outside Washington, DC. The topic was scheduled for just one short panel Thursday afternoon. But given the way that discussion went, it's understandable why organizers might not want to highlight the policy implications of their health care plans.  Rep. Mike Burgess (R-Texas), a doctor who sits on a House health subcommittee, told the conservative crowd that a reduction in the number of people with health insurance coverage shouldn't be viewed as a negative. \"If the numbers drop, I would say that's a good thing,\" Burgess said, \"because we've restored personal liberty in this country, and I'm always for that.\" Burgess seemed to imply that there are people who hate the idea of having health insurance but were forced to buy it because otherwise IRS agents would be \"chasing [them] down\" under the current law.

As they kick off their biggest conference of the year, leading conservatives from across the country can't seem to figure out what to do about the alt-right, a movement with close ties to both white nationalists and the White House.  The annual Conservative Political Action Conference began Thursday morning outside Washington, DC, with a strange denunciation of the movement by the executive director of the organization behind the event. In a speech titled \"The Alt Right Ain't Right at All,\" American Conservative Union executive director Dan Schneider said that the alt-right isn't really a conservative movement at all. Instead, he said, \"a hate-filled, left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term 'alt-right.'\" Schneider called the alt-right anti-Semitic, racist, and sexist.  \"CPAC, we have been slapped in the face,\" Schneider said. \"There is a sinister organization trying to worm its way into our ranks. We must not be duped, we must not be deceived. This is serious business.\"  It's understandable why Schneider would want to distance CPAC from the alt-right. But his organization didn't seem to mind associating itself with the movement when it created the schedule for this year's conference. White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon is scheduled to speak early this afternoon, just a few hours after Schneider and on the same stage. During an interview with Mother Jones at the Republican National Convention last summer, Bannon proudly tied Breitbart, the media organization he was then running, to the movement Schneider called racist. \"We're the platform for the alt-right,\" Bannon said.  One of this year's keynote speakers at CPAC was supposed to be Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart writer who called himself a \"fellow traveler\" of the alt-right. That view didn't seem to trouble the organizers of CPAC, who rescinded his invitation only after a video circulated online of Yiannopoulos saying he didn't have a problem with pedophilia.  But CPAC still appears to be just fine with the media organization that serves as the \"platform for the alt-right.\" As he was denouncing the movement, Schneider spoke in front of a banner featuring the logos of the event sponsorsincluding Breitbart.", "date": "2017/02/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/cpac-alt-right-steve-bannon", "title": "Conservatives Can't Figure Out Whether to Embrace or Denounce the Alt-Right"}, {"text": "Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback delivers his annual State of the State address on the floor of of the Kansas House of Representatives in January.  An ambitious effort by a Republican governor to drastically cut his state's taxes is crumblingand that's a bad omen for Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress who are hoping to slash tax rates at the national level.  Shortly after he became governor of Kansas in 2011, Sam Brownback went to work on rewriting the state's tax code. Together with the Republican-dominated legislature, he eliminated the top income tax bracket, lowered everyone else's income tax rate, and created a loophole that allowed some business owners to pay no state income taxes at all.  Brownback sold the cuts as a way to jolt the Kansas economy to life, promising major job growth thanks to the lower tax rates. To pass these tax measures, Brownback worked to replace moderate Republicans in the legislature who opposed his ideas with true-believer conservatives. He helped knock off nine moderate Republican incumbents, and the effort paid off when his tax reform passed in 2012.  But instead of the miracle growth that Brownback promised, the tax cuts have left a widening crater in the state budget. State economic growth has lagged behind the national pace, and job growth has stagnated. Lawmakers have been left scrambling each year to pass unpleasant spending cuts when tax revenue comes in below expected levels, leading to contentious fights in the legislature and state courts over reduced public school funding. When the state legislature convened last month, it faced a $320 million budget shortfall that needed to be closed before the end of the current fiscal year in Juneand a projected additional $500 million shortfall for the next fiscal year.  After more moderate Republicans joined the GOP-dominated legislature following last November's election, the party has appeared more willing to concede defeat and ditch Brownback's tax experiment. Last week, the state House and Senate passed a bill that would generate more than $1 billion by eradicating most of Brownback's reforms. It would raise personal income tax rates (though still not as high as the pre-Brownback rates) and end the loophole that has allowed 330,000 business ownersincluding subsidiaries of Wichita-based Koch Industriesto avoid paying income taxes.  The fate of that bill is still in doubt. Brownback vetoed the measure on Wednesday morning, after explaining, \"I am vetoing it because the legislature failed to fulfill my request that they find savings and efficiencies before asking the people of Kansas for more taxes.\" But the House quickly fought back, voting 85-40 to override the veto. But late Wednesday afternoon, the Senate fell three votes short of the the two-thirds majority necessary to pass the law without Brownback's approval, leaving the fate of the state's tax system uncertain.  So what's all of this got to do with Trump? Brownback's failures could complicate national tax-reform efforts, which have been high on the Trump administration's agenda. \"Lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league,\" Trump told airline executives earlier this month. \"That's coming along very well. We're way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we're going to announce something I would say over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax.\"  Like many of Trump's policy plans, his tax agenda remains largely a mystery. But the proposal he outlined during the presidential campaign shared many features with Brownback's experiment. It would slash personal income tax rates and reduce the number of brackets. It wouldn't eliminate business income taxes, but it would lower them to 15 percent, allowing many super-wealthy Americans to avoid paying high tax rates by funneling their income through their businesses.  That's not entirely coincidental. Trump and Brownback share a tax guide: Reaganomics guru Art Laffer. Laffer is best known for the Laffer curve, a diagram of his hypothesis that lowering tax rates could increase tax revenue by boosting economic output. Kansas paid $75,000 for Laffer to spend three days consulting with lawmakers on the state's tax plans. Laffer also visited Trump Tower to consult on tax reform last year, and in December he called Trump's campaign tax plans \"terrific.\" When Trump's treasury secretary nominee went before the Senate last month, Trump's transition press office emailed reporters a list of endorsements that started with glowing praise from Laffer. \"Steven Mnuchin is a wonderful choice for Treasury Secretary,\" Laffer said. \"He has a great understanding of finance, markets, and housing. He is committed to tax reform that will get our economy growing, create jobs, and make America the best place to do business.\"  By now, it's clear that Brownback's tax experiment hasn't produced the growth he promised. But that hasn't put an end to Republican efforts to replicate it on the national level. In December, Brownback suggested to the Wall Street Journal that Kansas' tax reforms could offer a model for Trump. And on Thursday morning, Brownback is scheduled to speakalmost certainly about his taxation modelat the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, DC, on a panel titled \"How Governors are Reclaiming America's Promise.\"", "date": "2017/02/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sam-brownback-kansas-tax-cuts-donald-trump", "title": "Why Kansas' Fiscal Implosion Is Bad News for Trump"}, {"text": "Michael Flynn may have lost his job as national security adviser, but congressional Democrats have made clear that they aren't going to let the Trump administration sweep the scandal under the rug. The ranking Democrats from six separate House committees sent a detailed letter to the White House's top lawyer Wednesday afternoon demanding answers regarding what administration officials knew about Flynn's communications last year with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, when they knew it, and what they did in response.  The letter is directed at Donald McGahn, the White House counsel. As The Washington Post reported on Monday, McGahn was personally informed last month by then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Flynn may have lied to members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the nature of his conversations with Kislyakand that Flynn could even be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. The Democrats' letter points out that despite that warning, White House officials continued to claim for weeks that Flynn did not discuss US sanctions during his talks with Russia's ambassador.  \"These reports raise grave concerns about the honesty and integrity of White House officials with the public,\" the letter says. \"The National Security Advisor provided false information to the public, which was then repeated by several senior White House officials. Even after learning that this information was inaccurate, no White House officials corrected those falsehoods.\"  The letter presses McGahn for a clear timeline of events. It asks whether Trump himself or other members of his team were aware of Flynn's discussion of sanctions with Kislyak prior to McGahn's January 26 meeting with the Department of Justice, and whether anyone ordered Flynn to engage in those discussions. The letter points to a tweet from Trump on December 30, 2016just a day after Flynn talked with the Russian ambassadorin which Trump lavished praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision not to retaliate against US sanctions. \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\" Trump wrote.  The Democrats also asked McGahn to explain why Flynn was allowed to receive classified briefings after the administration learned of his apparent deception. Referencing White House statements that Flynn had lost Trump's trust, the letter states that \"these reports raise more than 'trust' issuesthey also raise significant national security concerns.\"  The letter was sent by top Democrats on six committees: Elijah Cummings(Oversight and Government Reform), John Conyers (Judiciary), Adam Smith (Armed Forces), Bennie Thompson (Homeland Security), Adam Schiff (Intelligence), and Eliot Engel (Foreign Affairs).

The Massachusetts senator sent a scathing, 28-page letter detailing questions for Andy Puzderthe CEO of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's parent company, CKE Restaurantswhom Trump selected for the post. Warren is a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, which is scheduled to hold Puzder's confirmation hearing Thursday morning.  \"Your long record of public comments reveals a sneering contempt for the workers in your stores, and a vehement opposition to the laws you will be charged with enforcing.\"  Warren framed the letter as an effort to make an informed decision about whether to support Puzder's nomination. It asks questions ranging from how he plans to avoid conflicts of interest with CKE to how he would enforce the department's workplace safety rules. But there's nothing subtle about Warren's views on Puzder; the letter's introduction makes it quite clear that she views him as unfit for the job. \"You've made your fortune by squeezing the very workers you'd be charged with protecting as Labor Secretary out of wages and benefits,\" she writes. At another point: \"Your long record of public comments reveals a sneering contempt for the workers in your stores, and a vehement opposition to the laws you will be charged with enforcing.\"  Puzder is the last realistic hope the Democrats have for derailing one of Trump's main Cabinet nominations. And the fast-food CEO appears to be a juicy target. During his tenure running CKE, Puzder hasn't been shy about sharing his views regarding his low-wage employees, once calling them the \"best of the worst\" and often grousing about how they don't deserve a higher minimum wage. Puzder has even mused about how much simpler life would be if he could replace human workers with robots, saying, \"They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex or race discrimination case.\"  Warren threw all these issues back at Puzder in her letter, suggesting that he'd bring these views and practices from his business experience with him to the Department of Labor. \"Because of your inextricable ties to the industry that you will be tasked with regulating I am deeply concerned that you will be unable to work exclusively for the American people,\" Warren wrote. The senator expressed concern that Puzder would not pursue wage violation complaints and that he'd be hesitant to enforce tough sexual harassment regulations given his business' history of advertisements that feature models in bikinis, advertisements that Puzder has defended as \"very American.\"  The next labor secretary will also be charged with deciding the fate of the fiduciary rule, a regulation that mandates that retirement advisers give investment advice that is actually in their clients' interest rather than suggesting funds that offer the kickbacks for the advisers. That rule was supposed to go into effect in April, but Trump signed an order that, while not explicit in how it will be executed, will likely result in the rule being delayed and weakened, if not outright abandoned. Warren's letter included a number of pointed questions asking how Puzder would approach reviewing this conflict-of-interest regulation and whether he was consulted by the White House on the matter before Trump issued his directive.  Warren also questioned whether Puzder would be willing to enforce labor laws against his boss' company if the Trump Organization is accused of violating its workers' own rights. After all, while Trump may have handed over day-to-day control of his enterprises to his children, the president still reaps the financial gains from his business ventures, and a federal investigation of their business practices could make a dent in the profits headed to Trump's trust.

Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who was confirmed as health and human services secretary by a 52-47 vote in the Senate early Friday morning, has repeatedly voted against bills that could harm big tobacco. At the same time, he's received thousands of dollars in political contributions from the industry and held investments in tobacco companiesinvestments he says he didn't know about.  Early in Barack Obama's presidency, Congress renewed the State Children's Health Insurance Program. In order to pay for the program, lawmakers raised cigarette taxes by 62 cents per pack and cigar taxes by 40 cents per cigar. Price blasted the new fees. \"Today's tax hike serves as a useful reminder that the president is comfortable raising taxes on hard-working Americans to feed his reckless agenda,\" Price said in an April 2009 statement. \"President Obama has done nothing to demonstrate that he is a responsible steward of taxpayer money. Yet, he is forcing the American people to burn through even more of their income in the name of more government.\"  A few months later, Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which empowered the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. (The Supreme Court had ruled in 2000 that the FDA did not have that authority under existing law.) The legislation has enabled the agency to ban certain flavored cigarettes that might entice young people to begin smoking. It also allows the FDA to require additional warnings on packages.  \"How do you square reaping personal financial gain from the sales of an addictive product that kills millions of Americans every decade with also voting against measures to reduce the death toll inflicted by tobacco?\"  Price joined most Republicans in voting against the FDA legislation. But thanks to that bill, as health secretary, he will now have immense influence over how the tobacco industry operates. (The FDA is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.) In 2011, the Obama administration proposed adding graphic warning labelsincluding images of diseased mouths and lungsto the top half of cigarette packs. After a drawn-out legal battle, the courts ultimately upheld the FDAs ability to regulate tobacco packaging but struck down that specific version of the rule.* Following several years of inaction by the administration, a collection of medical and public health groups, including the American Cancer Society, sued the government last fall in an attempt to force it to finalize the new label requirements. Once he's in place at HHS, Price can ask the FDA to move forward with the new rules, weaken them, or abandon them altogether.  The conservative website Hot Air celebrated the latter possibility when Price's nomination was announced in November. \"Fortunately for all of us, most of the sore spots on the HHS and FDA regulatory front don't require cooperation from Congress or the courts,\" the site said, pointing to regulations on cigars and electronic cigarettes. \"These are things which can essentially be tidied up with a stroke of the pen once Trump and Price are in office.\"  Price has benefited from numerous tobacco industry donations during his political career. Back when he was a state legislator in Georgia in 1998, Philip Morris gave Price's campaign $300. More recently, the PAC for Altria Group, parent company to Philip Morris, donated $18,000 to Price's congressional campaigns. From 2008 to 2012, Price also received $19,000 from the PAC of RJ Reynolds, the company behind Camel and other cigarette brands.  Price's office did not respond to a request for comment.  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn) raised concerns about Price's personal investments in tobacco companies during his confirmation hearing last month. According to Price's financial disclosure forms, he sold off 768 shares in Altria and Philip Morris International for $37,000 in 2012. (Altria owns the American Phillip Morris brand. Phillip Morris International has been a separate company since 2008.) Franken started by asking Price to identify the \"leading cause of preventable death\" and then informed him that it was smoking.  \"That hits home,\" Price replied. \"I lost my dad, who was a Lucky Strike smoker from World War II, to emphysema. He prided himself on the fact that he never smoked a cigarette with a filter for years and years.\"  Franken expressed surprise that Price, a physician, would invest in products that lead to the deaths of about 480,000 people in the country each year. \"Congressman Price, you're a physician, which means you took the Hippocratic oath, a pledge to do no harm,\" Franken said. \"How do you square reaping personal financial gain from the sales of an addictive product that kills millions of Americans every decade with also voting against measures to reduce the death toll inflicted by tobacco?\"  \"It's a curious observation,\" Price responded, claiming that he had \"no idea\" about the stocks he owned; he suggested that they were purchased by a mutual fund or pension plan he had invested in. The tobacco investments were publicly disclosed in his financial report, and at other points in his hearing he acknowledged that he had the ability to direct his stock broker on other investments he held.  \"I find it very hard to believe that you did not know that you had tobacco stocks,\" Franken responded.

Trump ordered the Department of Labor to explore overturningor at least weakeninga dull-sounding Obama administration regulation known as the \"fiduciary rule.\" And while the details of that will be up to Trump's labor secretary, his order does at least push back the start date for the rule, which was supposed to go into effect in April. \"The rule is a solution in search of a problem,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday.  \"This is like putting only healthy food on the menu because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn't eat it because you might die younger.\"  The fiduciary rule is the sort of technical-sounding tweak that doesn't whip up a ton of attention during political campaigns, but it could have a major impact on the amount of money middle-class Americans are able to save for their retirements. The essence of the rule isn't all that complicated. It simply requires the retirement fund managers overseeing your 401(k) or IRA to actually act in your best interestrather than sacrificing your interests for their own personal gain.  It's an intuitive concept, but it's one that hasn't always been practiced by the industry. President Barack Obama's Labor Department spent six years writing the details of how exactly the fiduciary rule would work, publishing a finalized version last year. The department estimated that retirement accounts across the country lost a total of $17 billion per year due to investment advice that clearly isn't in the consumer's interest. Earlier Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a report detailing the rampant kickbacks that financial advisers receive when they recommend certain financial products to their clients. \"It's far too easy for an adviser to sell just one more annuity, regardless of whether it is a prudent choice for the investor, when a free vacation or an international cruise is waiting for him on the other side of the sale,\" the report says. \"These conflicts can result in devastating consequences for retirees.\"  Trump's directive was rolled out Thursday night by Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who now heads Trump's National Economic Council. Cohn offered a bizarre explanation for the move during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, arguing that the fiduciary rule limits consumers' choices. \"This is like putting only healthy food on the menu because unhealthy food tastes good but you still shouldn't eat it because you might die younger.\" Except unlike splurging on a Big Mac, where you know what you're getting, consumers tend to be unaware when their financial adviser's hidden conflicts of interest are siphoning away their retirement savings.  Around the time Trump officially signed the order Friday, Warren blasted him on Twitter:  After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 3, 2017  Trump paired his fiduciary rule memorandum with a separate order instructing various federal regulators to begin exploring how they can roll back financial rules put in place by Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform law enacted by congressional Democrats and Obama in the wake of the financial crisis. Much like Trump's earlier executive order attacking Obamacare, the anti-Dodd-Frank measure doesn't offer much in the way of specifics; rather, it appears to be intended to set a general tone for how Trump's administration will tackle financial regulation.  Trump neatly summed up the reason for his opposition to the Obama measures during a meeting with CEOs Friday morning: Financial reform made life harder for his uber-rich friends. \"Frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses,\" he said. \"They can't borrow money, they just can't because the banks won't let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.\"", "date": "2017/02/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/donald-trump-fiduciary-rule-dodd-frank-wall-street", "title": "Donald Trump Just Made It Way Easier for Your Financial Adviser to Rip You Off"}, {"text": "For someone born and raised in Michigan, Tom Price has an unusual penchant for commemorating Southern secessionists and their war to preserve slavery.  Price, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, moved to Georgia to complete his medical residency at Emory. As he rose through the ranks in state politicsjoining the state Senate in 1997 and moving up to the US House in 2005the former Midwesterner supported measures to promote the Confederate flag in state politics. At one point when he was a state senator, Price sponsored a bill to institute a Confederate history month and called for a flag celebrating the Confederacy to be flown above the state Capitol, and he's voted against anti-flag measures before the US Congress.  The Confederate flag has a long and complicated history in Georgia. In 1956, the state adopted a flag with a narrow blue band featuring the state seal on the left side and the Confederate battle flag taking up the rest of the design. The flag came two years after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education to desegregate schools. \"The state was in a desperate situation to preserve segregation,\" a 2000 report from the Senate Research Office stated. \"Resisting, avoiding, undermining, and circumventing integration was the 1956 General Assembly's primary objective.\"  The flag was a regular source of controversy, but it remained in place until 2001, when Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes fought to implement a new design. The new flag scheme didn't fully abandon the Confederate symbol. The state seal expanded to occupy the majority of the flag, but running along the bottom is a banner documenting \"Georgia's history,\" which includes the 1956 flag alongside other historic flags.  Price seemed inclined to ditch the 1956 design. He introduced an amendment to a bill in 2001 to create a commission to come up with a new compromise design. An article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution from December notes that Price didn't hold a personal affinity for the flag. But he still voted against the new design. According to a Journal-Constitution article from 2001, \"Price cited Martin Luther King III's description of the new flag as 'a good first step' and predicted opponents of the previous flag would press the issue again within a few years.\"  As Price predicted, the 2001 redesign hardly settled debates in Georgiathough it was fans of the old flag who stirred up the fight. Republican Sonny Perdue (now Trump's nominee for agriculture secretary) challenged Barnes for the governorship in 2002, campaigning against the flag change. He won, and Republicans took control of the state Legislature, making Price the Senate majority leader.  In his new role, Price shepherded through a compromise bill. The 1956 flag wouldn't be coming back, but the 2001 flag would be abandoned in favor of a new design inspired by the Confederate \"stars and bars,\" the flag that served as the Confederacy's first official national flag.  In 2004, Price co-sponsored a bill with five other Republican state senators that included a host of measures to celebrate the history of the losing side of the Civil War. The measure stalled, but had it been signed into law, April would have become Confederate History and Heritage Month in Georgia. (That eventually happened in 2009.) The 1956 flag would have been renamed the \"Georgia Memorial Flag,\" and it would have been flown above the state Capitol twice a year, on Confederate Memorial Day and Robert E. Lee's birthday.  Price's views on the Confederate flag came up briefly during his hearing before the Senate's health committee last month, when Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) pressed Price on his 2004 bill. \"I note that the resolution that commemorated the time of Southern independence mentions nothing about slavery,\" Kaine said. Price tried to dodge the inquiry, noting that he hadn't thought about the topic for a long time. But when pushed, Price said, \"Well, I think every heritage has things that are good about it. Every heritage has things that are harmful about it. And I'm happy to answer the specific question: I think slavery was an abomination.\"  The Confederate flag has been less of an issue for Price's political career since he moved to national politics. But in July 2015, when controversy around the use of the Confederate flag in South Carolina attracted national attention, Price joined the vast majority of Republicans who voted down an anti-Confederate flag measure introduced by Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi. The California congresswoman's measure would have removed state flags that contain the Confederate battle flag from most parts of the US House side of the Capitol and from House office buildings.

The Democrats were still boycotting, but Republicans rewrote the committee's rules to proceed on the confirmation votes without needing any minority members present. \"We took some unprecedented actions today due to the unprecedented action on the part of our colleagues,\" Hatch said. \"As I noted earlier, the Senate Finance Committee has been able to function even in the most divisive political environments. That all changed yesterday.\"  After years of obstruction from Republicans in Congress, Senate Democrats have decided to play the same game. A panel of Senate Democrats unexpectedly boycotted a committee hearing Tuesday morning in an attempt to derail two of President Donald Trump's most prominent Cabinet nominations.  The Senate Finance Committee was scheduled to vote on two of Trump's Cabinet nominees Tuesday morning: Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) for health and human services secretary. But the Democrats on the committee banded together in a boycott, and not a single one of them showed up. According to committee rules, at least one member of the minority party needs to be present in order to form a quorum to record a vote.  The committee's Republican chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, was incensed. \"This is the most pathetic thing I've seen in my time,\" he said. That sentiment represents a reversal from Hatch on whether presidential nominees deserve a committee vote. When a seat on the Supreme Court opened last year following Antonin Scalia's death, Hatch cited Merrick Garland as the sort of judge he could see the Senate confirming. When President Barack Obama in fact nominated Garland, less than a week after Hatch's comment, the senator changed his tune and joined the rest of the GOP caucus in refusing even to consider Garland's nomination.

But at a short press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Trump said that though he still thinks torture \"works,\" he will allow newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis to \"override\" him on this point.  Trump was questioned about his views on torture and other controversial matters by a BBC reporter, who asked, \"Mr. President, you've said before that torture works, you've praised Russia, you've said you want to ban some Muslims from coming to America, you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\"  In typical Trumpian fashion, the new president lashed out at the slightest bit of media criticism. \"This was your choice of a question,\" he said, clearly perturbed. \"There goes that relationship,\" he darkly joked.  Once he turned to the substance of the question, Trump said he would let Mattis make the decision about the sort of interrogation techniques used by the United States. Mattis has long been opposed to torture, fighting back against \"enhanced interrogation\" during George W. Bush's presidency. He reaffirmed that view at his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this month, and the Pentagon once again reiterated its opposition to techniques such as waterboarding earlier this week. During Friday's press conference, Trump noted that he doesn't concur with Mattis' views on torture. \"[Mattis] has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture,\" Trump said, \"or waterboarding, or however you want to define it'enhanced interrogation' I guess would be words that a lot of people like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I am giving him that power. He's an expert, he's highly respected.\" Trump added, \"I happen to feel that it does workI've been open about that for a long period of time. But I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win, with or without, but I do disagree.\"  During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to resurrect interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. During a February debate in New Hampshire, Trump said, \"I would bring back waterboarding. And I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\" He regularly complained that Barack Obama had weakened the United States' ability to fight abroad by banning the use of torture. \"Don't tell me it doesnt worktorture works,\" he's said.  Under the Geneva Conventions, torture is a war crime. Unlike the Bush administrationwhich at least cloaked its torture program under the Orwellian term of \"enhanced interrogation\" to duck international lawsTrump isn't trying to obfuscate what he believes.  Even if the country isn't about to revive its torture program, it is noteworthy that the president of the United States said, during his first press conference since taking office one week ago, that if he had his druthers he'd order the nation's military forces to commit war crimes.", "date": "2017/01/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-just-broke-his-campaign-promise-use-torture", "title": "Donald Trump Backs Away From His Campaign Pledge to Resurrect Torture"}, {"text": "Tom Price, President Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, has faced criticism in recent weeks that he's too closely tied to the health industry he may soon be charged with regulating. Democrats have focused on accusations that Price personally profited by buying stock in various medical companies before writing legislation that would boost the standing of those same companies. Price has denied all wrongdoing, and promised that if confirmed, he'd sell off any financial stake in medical and pharmaceutical companies.  But the industry still has another way to funnel money in Price's direction: by donating to his wife's political campaigns.  Betty Price has represented the 48th district in the Georgia state House since winning a special election in July 2015. In November, she became a member of the Republican deputy whip team in the House. An anesthesiologist prior to the launch of her political career, Betty has leaned on the health industry, both in Georgia and nationally, for campaign donations. And the medical industry has maintained its financial support for her since her husband was picked by Trumpdespite the fact that Betty Price won't face reelection for another two years.  The ethics agreement Price had to file as a part of his nomination as health secretary hinted at the idea that his wife's political position might clash with his role as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. In the agreement, Price promised to recuse himself from \"any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know the state of Georgia is a party or represents a party.\" That's going to be a tricky proposition for Price to carry out at HHS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are based in Atlanta and under the purview of the HHS secretary.  Price makes no mention of his wife's political funding in the ethics agreement. Georgia is one of 28 states that allow corporations to donate funds directly to political candidates. Campaigns for the Georgia legislature can accept up to $2,500 per election cycle from a corporate entity. Betty Price ran unopposed for reelection in both the primary and general election in 2016, garnering 100 percent of the 17,886 votes in her district. She received donations from local groups like Georgia Medical PACto be expected given her own background in medicine and her seat on the state House's health and human services committee.  National health care groups also took an interest in her uncontested state legislative race, donating at least $4,500 to her campaign, per public campaign finance reports. New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson donated $500; Minnesota-based United Health chipped in another $500. She received more than just direct contributions from health care companies: The employee PAC for Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories contributed $1,000.  The donations have not slowed since she won reelection in November. In the month after Trump announced Tom Price as his HHS pick, Betty Price's campaign fund reported receiving at least $2,250 in donations from national and state medical groups. On her end-of-the-year campaign finance report, she reported having received $500 from drug-manufacturing giant Pfizer (headquartered in New York) the day after Tom Price's nomination was announced. (A Pfizer spokeswoman says that the donation was actually made last August, and the company reported it on its own campaign contribution disclosure as having been made in August.)* San Francisco biotechnology company Genentech contributed $500 later in December.  These donations are not unique to Betty Price. Pfizer also donated to 22 other Georgia state legislators after the November election, and Genentech donated to five others. But these companies cannot donate directly to Price's congressional efforts, nor will they be able to donate to him as HHS secretary, so his wife's campaign could give them a path to curry favor with the man who will oversee their industry.  Betty and Tom Price's offices did not respond to requests for comment on whether her campaign would rethink corporate donations from the medical industry if Price is confirmed to lead HHS.  As a congressman from Georgia, Tom Price has been a favorite recipient of donations from medical professionals at the national levelthough thanks to stricter federal campaign finance laws, Price couldn't collect direct corporate donations. According to OpenSecrets, over the course of Price's career in Congress since 2006, health professionals have been by far his largest financial benefactor, donating more than $3.5 million. The second-largest group is insurance industry employees, with more than $800,000; in fourth place are people working in pharmaceuticals/health products, who have given more than $570,000.  As health secretary, Price would oversee Food and Drug Administration approval of new drugs and decide which treatments insurers are required to cover. The companies that donate to Betty Price will have a direct stake in these decisions. And with Betty Price still able to collect campaign contributions, they also have a way to try to influence them.  This story has been updated to include Pfizer's information on the timing of its donation to Betty Price.", "date": "2017/01/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betty-tom-price-georgia-health-industry-donations", "title": "Tom Price's Wife Gives Medical Industry Donors a Way to Influence National Policy"}, {"text": "Barack Obama had to hand his @POTUS Twitter handle to Donald Trump Friday afternoon.

Elizabeth Warren questions HHS nominee Rep. Tom Price on Medicare and Medicaid funding https://t.co/j6jNyCkKvZ https://t.co/ogEBfQjlXy  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 18, 2017  Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services won't say whether he agrees with the president-elect's campaign pledge to not cut funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) faced pointed questioning from Elizabeth Warren during a Senate hearing Wednesday morning, as the Massachusetts senator tried to get a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer on whether the Trump administration still intended to uphold that promise.  Trump, who is often all over the map when it comes to policy issues, was remarkably consistent during the campaign when it came to his desire to leave Medicare and Medicaid untouched. But Warren had good reason to wonder whether that has changed, especially with Price slated to manage health care policy in the new administration. Waving around a copy of legislation Price proposed as chair of the House budget committee, Warren said the bill included large cuts to the pair of health programs over the next decade: $449 billion in Medicare cuts and more than $1 trillion for Medicaid.  Price squirmed in his seat and suggested that money isn't the right metric with which to measure his plans, but Warren wasn't having it. \"These are really simple questions,\" Warren said. \"And frankly the millions of Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid today are not going to be very reassured by your notion that you have some metric other than the dollars that they need to provide these services.\"  Giving up hope that Price would be willing to give a clear answer, Warren ended that line of questioning with a simple suggestion: \"You might want to print out President-elect Trump's statement'I am not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid'and post that above your desk in your new office, because Americans will be watching to see if you follow through on that promise.\"", "date": "2017/01/18", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/elizabeth-warren-tom-price-medicare-medicaid", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Grills Trump's Health Nominee on His Efforts to Slash Medicare and Medicaid"}, {"text": "When Donald Trump's nominee to oversee the country's health care system appears before the Senate on Wednesday morning, he can expect to face a barrage of questions not only about Republican plans to replace Obamacare, but also about whether he broke the law by profiting off health stocks.  Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services, is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, before he later visits the Senate Finance Committee, which will vote on his confirmation. An orthopedic surgeon who has made it his political mission to reduce regulation of the medical industry, Price has led Republican attacks on President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act. He's one of the few members of Congress to lay out a detailed alternative, although his proposal has not been adopted by the president he hopes to work for. But Price's ability to get confirmed in the Senate might depend less on policy than on a string of alleged ethical lapses that have come to light since his nomination was announced in November.  All of this portends a confrontational hearing and a less-than-warm reception from Senate Democrats. Here are the controversies that are most likely to emerge in the hearing.  Obamacare replacement  Republicans have stumbled toward a repeal of the Affordable Care Act since the new Congress convened at the beginning of the month. Both chambers have passed resolutions to preclude a Democratic filibuster of a repeal, but Republicans are still struggling to figure out what will take Obamacare's place if they eradicate the law.  Price has introduced the same Affordable Care Act replacement bill in each session of Congress since the law was enacted in 2009. But Price's plan would likely strip many poor people of insurance by ending the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid coverage to millions of low-income Americans. Price would also change the formula for determining who gets government subsidies for private insurance so that it doesn't take income into accountmeaning far more of the tax benefits would go to the wealthy than under the current system.  Is Price's plan Trump's plan? No one knows. Over the weekend, Trump said his plan to replace Obamacare would offer \"insurance for everybody\"something Price's plan does not seem to do. CNN reported that Price has been excluded from the Trump team's deliberations on health care reform so that he can avoid answering questions about those plans in his Senate hearing.  Still, Price will have to offer some sort of vision for how the Trump White House will address the health systemand just promising to repeal Obamacare won't be enough. On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office released a report finding that the number of people without insurance would increase by 18 million under the first year of a repeal, with that number expanding to 32 million by 2026. Premiums for individually purchased insurance would also double beyond current projections over the next decade.  Conflicts of interest  Price has been the subject of ethics concerns since Trump announced his nomination. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Price has made more than $300,000 in trades in health care stocks over the past four years, while he continued to introduce health care legislation. Democrats called foul, with one House member writing a letter to federal financial regulators requesting an investigation into whether Price's trading broke the law. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has pushed the Office of Congressional Ethics to examine whether Price's stock trades violated laws prohibiting members of Congress from profiting off nonpublic knowledge.  Over the weekend, CNN reported that Price had bought between $1,001 and $15,000 in stock in a medical device company right before he introduced a bill that would have directly helped the company. On Tuesday, Schumer said that stock purchase \"could very well be a violation of the law.\"  Reproductive rights  Price is a staunch opponent of abortion rights. He has voted several times for a federal 20-week abortion ban, which stands in contrast to Trump's pledge to send the abortion debate \"back to the states\" when his Supreme Court picks try to overturn Roe v. Wade. But abortion isn't the only area where Price has fought against reproductive rights. Mother Jones reported in December on the myriad ways Price has tried to restrict contraception, including defunding Planned Parenthood, gutting Obamacare's mandate that employer-sponsored insurance plans cover contraception without a copay, and passing \"personhood\" bills that would make certain IUDs and the morning-after pill illegal.  Payments to doctors  In addition to expanding insurance coverage, the Affordable Care Act changed the way doctors and hospitals are compensated in order to slow the growth rate of health spending. Throughout his career, Price has complained that the government burdens doctors with too many regulations and attacked proposals that would pay doctors for results rather than for each test ordered or procedure performed. Although he can't repeal Obamacare's insurance expansion without congressional action, he can reverse many of the law's medical payment reforms, since these policies are largely at the discretion of the secretary of health and human services. Even as the American Medical Association has lavished praise on Price's nomination, a faction of doctors has rejected the AMA's endorsement and called for more scrutiny into Price's attacks on the Obamacare reforms.", "date": "2017/01/18", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/tom-price-senate-hearing-obamacare-ethics", "title": "Trump's Pick to Oversee Obamacare's Destruction Faces a Senate Grilling"}, {"text": "Former employees of Carl's Jr., the company run by Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump's choice to head the Department of Labor, got to testify on Capitol Hill todaybut not in his confirmation hearing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had scheduled the meeting to showcase how Democrats might grill Puzder. Dems had asked for former employees who would testify when Puzder appears before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP), but HELP chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) shot down that request.  It's easy to see why. \"Mr. Pudzer took a company that I loved and turned it into a business that makes money by stealing from its workers,\" Laura McDonald, a former 20-year employee at Carl's Jr., told the hearing. \"I honestly can't think of anyone less qualified to enforce laws that are supposed to protect employees.\"  McDonald and two other Carl's Jr. employees offered emotional testimonies about their poor working conditions and struggles to get by on a Carl's Jr. salary. Lupe Guzman, a 47-year-old single mother of six who runs the graveyard shift at a Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas, told the senators about surviving on $8.75 per hour in a job she's held for seven years. She said employees don't take breaks mandated by state law and alleged that paychecks excluded hours she'd worked. She also said she's been held up at gunpoint twice, and the company never inquired about her well-being, just whether anything had been stolen. \"I mean nothing to them,\" she said through tears. \"I'm just somebody who covers a shift that nobody wants. All they care about is protecting their money.\"  Guzman said she is barely scraping byunable to fix her car, with rent and bills eating up her paycheck. \"I work almost every day and am still considered poor,\" she said. \"I live on housing assistance, food stamps, and Medicaid just to survive. If I didn't survive on these things, I would be homeless with my kids.\"  \"I mean nothing to them,\" she said through tears. \"I'm just somebody who covers a shift that nobody wants. All they care about is protecting their money.\"  \"I also want to say loud and clear about what this means,\" Warren said in the hearing. \"That a giant corporation would build its entire business model around squeezing workers like you_and then count on the taxpayers to come up with food stamps, to come up with housing assistance, to come up with Medicaid. To come up with all the help that you need just barely to hold it together, so they can maximize their profits. This is just not right in America. I believe in capitalism, but I believe that these companies need to pay the full cost of keeping their workers working.\"  Puzder is CEO of the company that owns Hardee's and Carl's Jr., franchises that the current Labor Department has found to have violated wage laws in about 60 percent of its investigations of locations. Puzder himself has often been dismissive of his company's workers and has been skeptical of raising the minimum wage. (He's been vague on his exact views but was not a fan of President Barack Obama's calls to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10.) \"Mr. Puzder also has a long record of cheating workers out of overtime,\" Warren said Tuesday. \"And he has paid out millions of dollars to settle claims when he was caught cheating.\" (My colleague Tom Philpott wrote last month about a $9 million agreement the company reached in 2004 to settle overtime complaints.)  Midway through the Democrats' trial of Puzder, CNBC reported that Trump's man wouldn't be getting a hearing next week as initially scheduled. Instead, Puzder might not face congressional confirmation until February.  McDonald emphasized that the company had changed under Puzder's leadership. \"When Carl Karcher was alive and in charge, we felt like someone in the company at least cared about the workers,\" she said. \"Since Mr. Karcher passed away, CKE has tightened its budgets in a way that makes it impossible to do the job without working off the clock.

A Washington, DC, wine bar is suing President Donald Trump over his nearby hotel, which it claims has an \"unfair\" competitive advantage that violates the hotel's lease with the federal government. The owners of Cork Wine Bar, located 1.5 miles north of the Trump International Hotel, announced at a press conference this morning that they have filed a lawsuit alleging that the power of Trump's public office and simultaneous ownership of the restaurants at his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel are hurting other restaurants and bars in Washington for his personal benefit.  \"We all know that Washington, DC, is a company town,\" said Khalid Pitts, who owns the wine bar with his wife, Diane Gross. \"It's the center of business and the government, with the president being the principal focus of attention.\"  Pitts noted that the many lobbying and interest groups in town, including foreign governments, are constantly vying for advantages with top US officials. \"They have a choice on where to dine and where to hold events. Why wouldn't they go to a place that most pleases the president of the United States or where he's known to frequent?\"  Pitts and Gross declined to put an exact dollar figure on their losses attributable to the Trump hotel, which opened in September but only since Trump's inauguration has seemed to thrive. Both said they have noticed a decline, however, one that was significant after 10 years of restaurant ownership and couldn't be traced to normal competition from other restaurants or seasonal changes. Since Trump's election in November, multiple foreign diplomatic events have moved to the Trump hotel, and the lobby bar has become a regular hangout for lobbyists looking to connect with members of Trump's inner circle, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. According to the Associated Press, several Trump Cabinet members are living at the hotel. During the inaugural festivities in January, the Trump hotel was ground zero for VIPs attending the ceremony, and Trump's children mingled there with big donors and Trump's foreign business partners.  Trump has dined at the hotel numerous times, and his aides have touted it as a destination for those visiting Washington.  The lawsuit is not related to a lawsuit filed in New York City in January alleging that Trump is violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits federal officials from recieving financial benefits from foreign governments. The new suit does not seek any monetary damages, just a court order mandating that the unfair competition be halted.  \"That could be divestment, it could be the president resigns, or it could be the hotel or restaurant stops functioning,\" said Mark Zaid, one of the attorneys for the couple and their restaurant.  A key aspect of the lawsuit is Trump's continued ownership of the hotel, which occupies a government-owned building that Trump leases from the federal government. That lease appears to prohibit any elected federal office-holder from benefiting from the lease, a clause which Cork's attorneys say was put into the contract to help avoid this very type of situation, where a government official could be giving the business a boost.  \"Whether it was at a press conference, whether it was in a meeting with a member of the House of Representatives, the overall promotion of the business enterprises is steady, unrelenting, and unapologetic,\" said Steven Schooner, a George Washington University law professor and another attorney for the couple.  Although Trump pledged to remove himself from the daily operation of his businesses, he is still the majority owner of the hotelhis adult children have a small stake in the operationwhich means he is also named personally in the lawsuit. Presidents are shielded from lawsuits against actions they have taken in their official capacity but can be sued for activities undertaken as private citizens. For the case to proceed, Trump will have to be served with the lawsuit personally.  Alan Garten, an attorney for the Trump Organization, told CNN that the Cork lawsuit was \"a wild publicity stunt completely lacking in legal merit.\" Asked about the criticism, Zaid cracked that \"everything he seems to do is a wild publicity stunt, so we're in good company.\"  Pitts, who has previously worked for the Service Employees International Union and more recently as the political director for the Sierra Club, acknowledged that there will be blowback and accusations that the lawsuit is politically motivated.  \"When we walk out of here there's going to be a bit of political theater...but that's national DC,\" Pitts said. \"This is about local DC. This is about a local business and other local businesses that are trying to make it here in the city, and we feel the president of the United States owning restaurants, promoting restaurants, is unfair and to the detriment of other restaurants.\"  Read the full complaint below:", "date": "2017/03/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/dc-wine-bar-sues-trump-unfair-competition", "title": "DC Wine Bar Sues Trump for Unfair Competition"}, {"text": "Update: The New York Post briefly interviewed Angela Chen who said she \"was 'not comfortable' commenting on her purchase and how it could potentially help her business.\"  Last week, Donald Trump's company sealed its first big post-inaugural real estate transaction, selling a $15.8 million penthouse to a Chinese-American business executive who runs a company that touts its ability to exploit connections with powerful people to broker business deals in China.  New York City property records show that Xiao Yan Chen, the founder and managing director of a business consulting firm called Global Alliance Associates, purchased the four-bedroom, six-bathroom condo in Trump's Park Avenue high-rise on February 21. Before taking office, Trump signed documents removing himself from the board of directors of Trump Park Avenue LLC, the entity that sold the unit, but he remains the LLC's owner.  Chen, who also goes by Angela Chen, did not return multiple calls and emails requesting comment. Her company bills itself as a \"boutique business relationship consultancy\" for US firms seeking to do business in China. \"For a select clientele,\" the firm says that it \"facilitates the right strategic relationships with the most prominent public and private decision makers in China.\"  \"As counselors in consummating the right relationshipsquite simplywe provide access,\" the company's website claims. \"Establishing a network of credible and proprietary relationships, known by the Chinese as 'ghanxi,' is the single most important aspect of initiating and sustaining a successful business venture in China.\" A connection with Trumpeven a fleeting onecould only help in the ghanxi department.

Until Chen's purchase, none of Trump's major real estate properties had reported any major sales since he became president.

And this means that the president could have a secret creditor to whom he owes tens of millions of dollars.  According to Trump's financial disclosure records and various news reports, Trump is carrying hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. These transactions could provide his creditors with leverage over the new commander-in-chief. Moreover, it would be difficult for Trump to refinance or modify the terms of his various loans without raising suspicion that he is receiving favorable treatment because of his position. (Imagine a bank gives him a good rate. Would this suggest it might receive preferential treatment from the US government Trump heads?) Because Trump has refused to release his tax returns, it's impossible for the public to know exactly how much he owes and to whom. And Trump never kept his campaign promise to reveal all his creditors and obligations.  The financial disclosure form he filed last year did note more than a dozen loans totaling at least $713 million. But the full amount could be more. And buried in the paperwork is a puzzling debt that ethics experts say could suggest that Trump has a major creditor he has not publicly identified.

(The true value of the loan could be much higher; the form requires Trump only to state the range of the loan's value, and he selected the top range, \"over $50,000,000.\") Elsewhere in the same document, Trump notes that he owns this LLC. That is, he made the loan to himself. There's nothing necessarily unusual about that.  Here's where the situation gets odd. With Trump owning the Chicago Unit Acquisition LLCand the LLC being owed $50 million or more by Trumpthis company should be listed on Trump's disclosure as worth at least that much, unless it has debt offsetting this amount. Yet on Trump's latest disclosure form, Chicago Unit Acquisition is not listed at all. The disclosure rules say that any asset worth more than $1,000 must be noted. So this is the mystery: Why is this Trump-owned firm that holds a $50 million-plus note from Trump not worth anything?  Buried in the paperwork is a puzzling debt that ethics experts say could mean Trump has a major creditor he has not publicly revealed.  The answer could be that Chicago Unit Acquisition has its own debts that cancel out its value, says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who specializes in government and corporate ethics. In other words, Trump's LLC could owe $50 million and possibly much more to one or more creditors that have not been disclosed to the public. Though the president essentially could be on the hook to some entity or some person for over $50 million, the financial disclosure rules do not require Trump to list the loans and liabilities of companies he owns. (He only has to reveal his personal loans.)  \"I think the American people are at risk because we don't know know with whom Donald Trump is entangled financially,\" Clark says. \"If I owe a lot of money to someone, I will probably want to do what I can to keep that person or institution happy. We don't know the terms of this debt and we don't know whether Donald Trump will be tempted to look out for his own financial interest in addressing the concerns of his creditor, whoever that is.\"  A recent Wall Street Journal article noted that Trump pays a minimum of $4.4 million a year in interest in connection with his loan from Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC. His disclosure form states he pays the prime interest rate plus 5 percent for this loan. (Consequently, Chicago Unit Acquisition would have at least that much in annual revenue, though none is reported.) And the Journal report deepened the mystery. It noted that it had paid two research firms to search for paperwork connected to this loan, but both came up empty-handed.  In a 2016 interview with the New York Times, Trump briefly addressed the loan. He said that he had purchased the debt, via Chicago Unit Acquisition, from a group of banks he had previously borrowed from. Jason Greenblatt, the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, would not discuss with the Times why Trump had not simply retired the debt and instead was continuing to pay interest on it. \"I am not sure it's appropriate for us to discuss our sort of internal financial reasoning behind transactions in the press,\" Greenblatt told the Times. \"It's really personal corporate trade secrets, if you will. Neither newsworthy or frankly anybody's business.\"  On his 2015 disclosure form, Trump did list Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC as having a value, putting it at between $1,000 and $25,000still substantially lower than the sum Trump reports owing to it. When the Times asked Trump why Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC was valued so low on his financial disclosure, he replied, \"We don't assess any value to it because we don't care. I have the mortgage. That is all there is. Very simple. I am the bank.\"  \"Whether or not Mr. Trump cares or not about a liability is irrelevant to his obligation to disclose information on the Form 278,\" says Norm Eisen, who was a top ethics attorney in the Obama administration and who now co-chairs Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Questions about the apparent inconsistency in how the loan was and is treated on his disclosures are legitimate, and a normal president would provide additional information to clear them up.\"  Alan Garten, Trump's personal attorney, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House.  Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration and who co-chairs CREW with Eisen, says if there are no loans offsetting the value of Chicago Unit Acquisition, Trump's disclosure form should list the outstanding debt as an asset. \"None of the underlying assets or liabilities of the LLC owned by Trump need to appear on the 278just its net value and Trump's ownership in it,\" Painter says. \"That is one of the reasons the form is incomplete. If the LLC is owed money, that is a positive; if it owes money, that is a negative, for determining its value.\"  Either Trump's disclosure report is incomplete or there could be a hidden creditor, Eisen and Painter assert. If Trump were to release his tax returns, as all other major presidential candidates have done in recent decades, they point out, he could clear up the matter by providing information on his interest payments. (Eisen and Painter have filed a lawsuit against Trump alleging that the president has violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution by maintaining a number of beneficial financial relationships with foreign governments.)  \"Without more information, we cannot properly assess the import of this entry, or of the changes in how it was reported,\" Eisen says. \"We need those additional details, including to assess possible conflicts. It may well be the case that the answers lie in Mr. Trump's tax returns, but he has refused to provide them. This is yet another transparency failure on the part of the president.\"", "date": "2017/02/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/does-trump-have-mystery-creditor", "title": "Donald Trump's Mystery $50 Million (or More) Loan"}, {"text": "The government's top ethics watchdog sent a letter to the White House on Tuesday stating that Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, almost certainly broke ethics rules by promoting Ivanka Trump's clothing line and that the administration should investigate her and consider disciplinary action.  Conway appeared on Fox & Friends last week to discuss the decision by the retail chain Nordstrom to drop Ivanka Trump's clothing line from its stores. Standing in the White House briefing room in front of a presidential seal, Conway bragged that she owns Ivanka Trump clothing and urged viewers to purchase items from the president's daughter's line.  In the letter to Stefan Passantino, deputy counsel to the president and the White House's designated ethics officer, Office of Government Ethics executive director Walter Shaub cited a rule forbidding executive branch employees from endorsing commercial products and pointed to a hypothetical example written into the regulation that's nearly identical to Conway's behavior.  \"I note the OGE's regulation on misuse of position offers as an example the hypothetical case of a Presidential appointee appearing in a television commercial to promote a product,\" Shaub wrote. \"Ms. Conway's actions track that example almost exactly.\"  While Democrats in Washington have criticized the Trump administration for a string of potential ethical lapses, Republicans have generally kept quiet. Conway's comments, however, led to quick criticism from congressional Republicans, including House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, who together with the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, sent a letter to Shaub recommending that he review the incident.  Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that Conway had been \"counseled\" on the incident, but he did not elaborate on what that meant. Shaub, in his letter, said he has not been notified by the White House of any disciplinary action against Conway.  \"Under the present circumstances, there is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted,\" Shaub wrote.

In a recent interview with Indonesian weekly Tempo titled \"I Have Access to President Trump,\" Hary Tanoesoedibjo, a billionaire who inked deals with the Trump Organization to build luxury resorts on the islands of Bali and Lido, said he has instant access to Trump's children and through them can reach Trump whenever he wants. Before assuming office, Trump declined to divest from any of his businesses but said he would no longer have any involvement with the day-to-day operations of the Trump Organization, which is now being run by his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump also said his company would not initiate any new foreign deals, although it would continue to develop projects that were already in progress, including the two resorts he is building with Tanoesoedibjo that are barely underway.  In the Tempo interview, which appears in the Indonesian magazine's print edition with a short excerpt online, Tanoesoedibjo shed little new light on the resort projects, declining to provide details on how the projects will be financed (\"third parties, i.e. banks and financial institutions, personal capital and those of partners\") or how much Trump is being paid for his involvement. According to Trump's latest personal financial disclosure form, last year he was paid between $2 million and $10 million for his role in the Indonesian projects.  Even though Trump is no longer involved in the daily management of their joint venture, Tanoesoedibjo told the magazine that his existing relationship with Trump means he can help put people in touch with the American president. He noted that he set up a 2015 meeting between Trump and two Indonesian politicians, which Trump turned into a campaign stunt. One of the politicians was later caught on tape in what was allegedly an effort to solicit a $4 billion payout from an American mining company seeking to do business in Indonesia.  \"I'm just a small fry, but if other people have difficulty getting to him, I can do it easily,\" Tanoesoedibjo said in a portion of the interview only available in the magazine's print version. \"I communicate with his children over our businesses. I can meet with his kids anytime. I just need to pick up the phone. My WhatsApp messages are also responded.\"  Mother Jones contacted Tanoesoedibjo directly to confirm the accuracy of this quote and other comments that appeared in the story.  \"This is absolutely not true,\" Tanoesoedibjo replied in an email, but then proceeded to confirm the essence of the quote from the magazine. \"I just communicate with Donald Trump Junior, Eric Trump and the management team over our business, nothing's [sic] else. It's a professional relationship since we are in partnership. We can communicate face to face or through email or sms or phone call, depending on the need.\"  Tanoesoedibjo and his wife attended Trump's inauguration in January, documenting the VIP treatment they received on Instagram.  One of the journalists for Tempo who conducted the interview with Tanoesoedibjo said the magazine stands by the quote and has a recording and transcript to back it up. Tanoesoedibjo made similar comments about his ability to facilitate access to Trump in an interview with Reuters.  Tanoesoedibjo has political ambitions of his own in Indonesia, where he founded his own political party. In prior interviews, Tanoesoedibjo has said he was inspired by Trump's ability to transition from a wealthy businessman to a political leader. He is currently mulling a presidential bid in his home country.  Tanoesoedibjo and his wife, Liliana, attended Trump's inauguration in January, documenting the VIP treatment they received on Instagramincluding a chauffeured ride down the Pennsylvania Avenue inaugural parade route, past waiting crowds and police officers standing at attention. Other Instagram posts showed the couple at exclusive parties before and after the ceremony and posing with members of Trump's family. In the Tempo interview, Tanoesoedibjo said he and his wife attended the inauguration as guests of the Trump Organization and paid their own way.  In the Tempo interview, Tanoesoedibjo said he last met with Trump on January 4, just over two weeks before Trump entered the White House, and that he held extended meetings with Trump's children on January 18 in New York Citymeetings that were also documented on Instagram. Asked how often he has met with Trump, Tanoesoedibjo was elusive.  \"I don't count, but often enough,\" he told Tempo.  Asked about what he and Trump had spoken about in early January, Tanoesoedibjo refused to comment.  \"I cannot say,\" he told the magazine. \"It would not be ethical, especially now that he is the president.\"  Tanoesoedibjo told Tempo that there was no conflict of interest in Trump being president of the United States and his business partner on luxury resorts in Indonesia.  \"To be honest, Trump becoming president is a burden for me,\" Tanoesoedibjo said. \"I must make sure that all projects run well because [Tanoesoedibjo's company] MNC carries Indonesia's reputation.\"", "date": "2017/02/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/donald-trump-indonesian-business-partner-brags-about-his-access", "title": "Trump's Indonesian Business Partner Brags About His Access"}, {"text": "A key Trump White House official may have violated the Constitution in 2015 when he delivered a paid speech in Moscow and dined with Vladimir Putin, congressional Democrats alleged Wednesday. According to the lawmakers, Michael Flynn, the controversial national security adviser, may have run afoul of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause.  \"I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity.\"  Since Donald Trump's election in November, ethics experts have raised concerns that the president's many overseas business interests might violate the Emoluments Clausea provision that prohibits federal office holders from accepting financial benefits from a foreign government. But the possibility that Flynn, a retired Army general, may have also violated the clause is new.  The concern was raised in a letter signed by top Democrats on the House Oversight, Armed Services, Judiciary, Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees and focuses on a trip to Russia that Flynn took in December 2015. On the trip, Flynn attended a 10th anniversary gala celebration for RT, the pro-Russia news outlet owned by the Russian government. At the gala, Flynn appeared on a panel and then sat next to Putin during dinner. Flynn retired from the military prior to the trip, but the Democratic letter notes that he may still have been covered by the Emoluments Clause.  In an interview with the Washington Post last year, Flynn downplayed the importance of the meeting by making it clear that he was only there as a paid speaker.  \"I was asked by my speaker's bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity,\" Flynn told the Post. \"The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 people in the audience.\"  Flynn would not tell the Post how much he was paid for the event. The White House did not immediately respond to Mother Jones' request for comment on the letter.  Flynn had a long career in the US Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant general, and spent two years as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama. After clashing with Obama, Flynn retired from the Army in August 2014, roughly 16 months before his trip to Moscow. But the House Democrats' letter points out that the Department of Defense has issued multiple warnings to retired military officers about accepting payments from foreign governments.  \"Significantly, retired regular military officers are also subject to the Emoluments Clause because they are subject to recall, and, therefore, hold an 'Office of Profit or Trust' under the Emoluments Clause,\" a 2013 Department of Defense white paper reads.  The Democrats point to other Department of Defense memos making clear that the restriction covers commercial entities owned by foreign governments, which could include RT because it is part of the state-owned RIA Novosti press agency.  The letter was sent to newly confirmed Secretary of Defense James Mattis. It asks for an investigation, including an examination of communications between Flynn and RT, as well as the details of how much he was paid.", "date": "2017/02/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/michael-flynn-emoluments-clause", "title": "House Dems Demand Investigation of Michael Flynn's Putin Dinner"}, {"text": "Hary and Liliana Tanoesoedibjo pictured at the Trump Hotel with Eric and Lara Trump.  Donald Trump vowed to wall himself off from his business interests when he became presidentbut at least two of his wealthy foreign business partners attended his inauguration as VIPs, where they watched the swearing-in from prime seats, partied with Trump insiders, and posed for pictures with Trump's children and grandchildren. Here's just one example of their incredible access during the inaugural festivities: The wife of one of Trump's partners, Indonesian billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo, posted a video from inside a vehicle driving the locked-down parade route after the ceremony, as police officers stood at attention and spectators waited behind barricades for a glimpse of the new first family.  Penjagaan ketat dan ratusan ribu penonton memadati pinggir jalan protokoler untuk melihat \"inaugural parade\" A video posted by liliana tanoesoedibjo (@liliana_tanoesoedibjo) on Jan 20, 2017 at 2:52pm PST  Despite repeated warnings from ethics experts that he needed to take dramatic steps to separate himself from his sprawling business empire, Trump entered the Oval Office with unprecedented conflicts of interest, including lucrative partnerships with a slew of rich foreign developers around the globe. At a press conference on January 11, Trump announced he would place his assets in a trust controlled by his sonsthough not a blind trust, as experts had recommendedand that his company would cease cutting new deals with foreign interests during his time in office.  But Trump made clear that existing foreign deals would remain in place. Partners in two of those projectsTanoesoedibjo, with whom Trump is developing a pair of luxury resorts in Indonesia, and Hussain Sajwani, a Dubai-based real estate developer who has licensed Trump's name for luxury villas and lush desert golf coursesattended the inaugural festivities.  The conflict-of-interest laws that govern all other federal employees don't apply to the president, but Trump's foreign entanglements take him into ethically murky terrain. Some experts, including the lawyers who advised George W. Bush and Barack Obama, believe some of his dealings with foreign partners could violate the Constitution. Days into his presidency, in fact, Trump was hit with a lawsuit spearheaded by prominent ethics lawyers alleging that he is in breach of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving financial benefits from foreign governments. The clause typically applies to payments or gifts from foreign officials and governments, but Tanoesoedibjo offers a good example of just how convoluted Trump's conflict issues could become. Tanoesoedibjo, who has previously run for office in Indonesia, has formed his own political party and, in the wake of Trump's victory, is contemplating his own presidential run.  Both Tanoesoedibjo and his wife, Liliana, documented their trip to the inauguration on Instagram, starting with a pre-inauguration visit to New York, where the couple met with Donald and Eric Trump at Trump Tower and then lunched with Donald Jr.  In Washington, the couple posted photos of themselves at their room at the Trump hotel, at a reception where they mingled with a Trump resort executive, and on the steps of the US Capitol at the inaugural ceremony, where Tanoesoedibjo gave an interview to Voice of America. In the interview, Tanoesoedibjo dismissed conflict-of-interest concerns over Trump's business dealings with foreign partners.  Trump's inaugural committee offered major perks to donors who contributed at least $100,000 toward the event, including a complimentary shuttle service to ferry them and their guests to and from events. But as foreign nationals, the Tanoesoedibjosand the Sajwanisare prohibited by law from contributing to this or other political committees. Neither the White House nor the Trump Organization responded to requests for comment about the Tanoesoedibjos' and Sajwanis' attendance at the inauguration.  After the swearing-in ceremony, the Tanoesoedibjos posted more photos of the festivities, including some showing them posing with the families of Eric and Donald Trump Jr.  The Tanoesoedibjos' social-media posts also show that Hussain Sajwani attended Trump's inauguration. Sajwani is a wealthy Middle Eastern businessman, based in Dubai, where he is the chairman of DAMAC Properties, a real estate development firm that has partnered with Trump to open Trump-branded golf courses and luxury villas in Dubai. The newest course is set to open early next month. At Trump's New Year's Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, he praised Sajwani, who he said was in attendance.  At his January 11 press conference, Trump said he was so committed to eliminating possible conflicts of interest that he had recently turned down a new deal with Sajwani.  \"Over the weekend I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great great developer from the Middle East,\" Trump said. \"Hussein, DAMAC, a friend of mine, a great guy. I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai, a number of deals, and I turned it down. I didn't have to turn it down because as you know I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president.\"  But he didn't address his ongoing deals with Sajwani. According to Trump's last personal financial disclosure, filed in May, the president earns between $2 million and $10 million a year from his licensing deals with DAMAC.

In an Instagram post just hours after the inauguration, Ali Sajwani, Hussain Sajwani's son, was more effusive, writing that \"the world is looking forward to a lucrative eight years ahead!\" Ali Sajwani took down his post after this story was published. Here's a screenshot:  It's not clear whether the younger Sajwani (who describes himself as an owner of DAMAC on his LinkedIn page and public bio) attended the inauguration or if the photo is from an earlier encounter.

He refuses to divest from his global business holdings. His company continues to make foreign deals even after he promised to halt them. He owes hundreds of millions of dollars to domestic and overseas banks and other financial institutions. And Trump has yet to release his tax returns, making it impossible to know the full extent of his business dealings, liabilities, and other potential conflicts in the United States and around the world.  On the first day of Trump's presidency, here is a guide to the conflicts and ethical questions that will dog him from the moment he steps foot in the White House.  Trump's Other Home on Pennsylvania Avenue  There was a joke during the presidential campaign: Win or lose, Trump would still have a presence on DC's iconic Pennsylvania Avenue. The Trump International Hotel opened last year in the historic Old Post Office Building four blocks from the White House, charging $850 a night for a room and $26 for a hamburger. Trump's unexpected victory, however, presented a new problem for the incoming president: He will violate the Trump International's lease the moment he takes office.  Trump's lease with the General Services Administrationthe landlord of the federal governmentbans any elected official, including the president, from having a financial stake in or gaining a financial benefit from the property. Congressional Democrats argue that Trump, under the terms of the lease, must legally divest himself from the 263-room hotel before taking office. If he chooses not to divest, Democrats say the GSA should evict Trump.  The conflicts here are many. Trump's administration will oversee the GSA and handpick its leader, and the agency will in turn be tasked with negotiating with Trump Organization officials over rent, lease terms, and so on. GSA officials have hedged their comments about the fate of the hotel. The agency said in a statement in December that it \"plans to coordinate with the president-elect's team to address any issues that may be related to the Old Post Office building.\" Trump's transition team stayed mum about the lease controversy, while Trump himself has refused to cut ties with the hotel. The Trump International, meanwhile, has courted foreign dignitaries, raising questions about whether the incoming administration was pushing foreign governments to patronize the hotel. This week, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer gave a shout-out to the hotel: \"It's a stunning hotel. I encourage you to go there if you haven't been by.\"  The Foreign Connection  The emoluments clause was an obscure provision of the US Constitutionuntil Trump arrived on the scene. The clause prohibits any government official from receiving money, gifts, or anything else of value from a foreign government. In the view of many constitutional experts, Trump stands in violation of the emoluments clause from the first day of his presidency. \"Applied to Mr. Trump's diverse dealings, the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed,\" wrote Norm Eisen, a former chief ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama, and Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush.  A foreign state-owned bank rents space in a Trump-owned building. Trump has loans via a partnership with the Bank of China. Foreign diplomats and governments are paying to stay at the Trump International Hotel in DC, which is largely owned by Trump and run by his company. And then there are the many Trump-owned and -branded hotels around the globedeals that in some cases involve partnerships with questionable characters. (A project in Azerbaijan with the son of the country's transportation minister is one glaring example.) All of these sources of moneyand many morerun afoul of the emoluments clause, according to Eisen and Painter.  Trump has responded to questions about his conflicts with flat denials. \"The law is totally on my side,\" he said in late November, \"meaning the president can't have a conflict of interest.\" Ethics experts say this isn't true. In an analysis for the Brookings Institution, Eisen and Painter studied legal and historical precedent and came to the conclusion that evidence \"compellingly\" supports \"the longstanding and near-unanimous consensus among lawyers and legal scholars that the Emoluments Clause applies in full to the President.\"  At a press conference earlier this month, Trump said he was turning control of his company over to his sons and declared that the Trump Organization would pursue no new international business during his presidency. He also said the company would terminate many foreign projects (like the Azerbaijani project, which has long been dormant anyway) that the Trump Organization had in development. But just this week, one of his Scottish golf courses announced plans to expand, and Trump projects in Indonesia appear to be moving forward. While Trump bragged at the press conference about turning down a deal with Dubai-based property development company DAMAC, he did not address the fact that he has an ongoing licensing deal with the company worth between $2 million and $10 million a year.  It's Not What You OwnIt's What You Owe  Trump, as Mother Jones has reported, will enter the White House as the most indebted president in history. And the new president's lenders, which include foreign financial institutions, raise a whole slew of questions.  According to Trump's financial disclosure forms, his largest lender is Deutsche Bank, which he owes $364 million. The German bank and US law enforcement officials have sparred in recent years, with the bank agreeing to pay a $7.2 billion fine for its role in the 2008 mortgage crisis. The Justice Department has an ongoing investigation into the bank for allegedly helping funnel money out of Russia.  The fact that Trump will enter office with his biggest lender under investigation by his administration is one of the most obvious conflicts his debts pose. But there are other ethical issues: What happens if one of his lenders wants to renegotiate the loan's terms? How can the public be sure that the bank isn't using its leverage to curry favor or that Trump isn't using his position to seek special treatment? Although Trump has said he is separating himself from the daily operations of his company, he has personally guaranteed a number of his loans. Will Trump recuse himself if a decision directly involving one of his lenders lands on his desk?  Trust Isn't Blind  During his press conference earlier this month, Trump laid out his plan to insulate himself from conflicts of interest. He would place all his assets into a trust controlled by his sons, who would not discuss any of the Trump Organization's business dealings with him. An \"independent ethics adviser\" would vet any new Trump Organization deals. And Trump would donate any hotel profits derived from foreign governments to the US Treasury.  Ethics experts were aghast. They had been nearly unanimous in their advice that Trump place his assets in a blind trust run by an independent trustee who oversees the assets and can sell off those that pose a conflict. Trump's plan was so far outside the boundaries of what past presidents and Cabinet members have typically done that the usually press-shy director of the Office of Government Ethics publicly blasted the proposal. Trump's transition team did not even consult with the OGE, according to Walter Shaub, the office's director. \"We would have told them that this arrangement fails to meet the statutory requirements,\" he said.  For Trump, however, the issue appears to be settledeven if that means entering the White House as the most conflict-ridden president in US history.", "date": "2017/01/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/your-day-one-guide-president-trumps-conflicts-interest", "title": "Your Day-One Guide to President Trump\u0089\u00db\u00aas Conflicts of Interest"}, {"text": "After Donald Trump nominated longtime Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin to be secretary of the treasury, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Democrats' leading anti-Wall Street crusader, asked to include \"victims of Mnuchin's foreclosure machine\" at his Senate confirmation hearing. According to Warren, Senate Republicans rebuffed her request. So on Wednesday, one day before Mnuchin goes before the Senate, Warren convened a panel of women who testified that OneWest Bank, under Mnuchin's leadership, ruthlessly tried to take away their homes.  \"If Steve Mnuchin become secretary of treasury, if he runs our country the way he ran OneWest Bankcutthroatthis country is in trouble,\" said Sylvia Oliver, a New Jersey woman whose home was scheduled to be foreclosed on by OneWest on Wednesday. According to Oliver, OneWest has refused to modify her mortgage, but she managed to stave off foreclosure with the assistance of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who was at Wednesday's forum.  In early 2009, Mnuchin led a team of investors in purchasing failed home lender IndyMac from the federal governmentafter extracting a promise that the government would help pick up the tab for any lossesand took over as CEO of the bank, which changed its name to OneWest. During his tenure, which covered the time when the four women who testified ran into trouble with the bank, OneWest was known for its aggressive tactics in dealing with foreclosure. In 2015, Mnuchin sold OneWest to another California bank, CIT, for more than twice what he and his fellow investors had paid. Mnuchin, who had previously donated to Democratic candidates, joined Trump's campaign fundraising team in May 2016, when Trump was still toxic to many Republicans, and he became one of Trump's first announced Cabinet picks.  \"The OneWest model was terrible for homeowners, but it was great for Mr. Mnuchin,\" Warren said on Wednesday, claiming that Mnuchin pocketed more than $200 million from the sale to CIT. \"At [Thursday's] hearing, he will have the opportunity to explain why his years of grinding families into the dirt at OneWest Bank does not disqualify him from becoming the nation's top economic official.\" (A spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch did not respond to a request for confirmation that Warren had asked to include the foreclosure victims in Thursday's hearing.)  Cristina Clifford, a California acupuncturist, told the panel that her business began to falter in 2009 and she struggled to make her mortgage payments to IndyMac. Clifford said the bank told her that she didn't qualify for a mortgage adjustment because she had always made her payments on time. She said she stopped doing so, on the bank's recommendation. But by the time she was approved for a mortgage modification and submitted the paperwork, the bank was under Mnuchin's control. It cashed the check she sent with the paperwork, she said, but insisted it never received her application. This happened twice, Clifford said, and eventually the house was sold by the bank, even as she says her lawyer was attempting to work with OneWest to avoid a foreclosure.  \"It was OneWest that saw a chance to make money,\" Clifford told Mother Jones. \"They could've kept me in the house and worked with me, or they could've sold the house and made a couple extra thousand dollars.\"  Senate Democrats are expected to grill Mnuchin on OneWest's business tactics tomorrow. The Hill obtained an advance copy of Mnuchin's prepared statements and reported that he will defend OneWest as \"an American success story.\"  \"My group had nothing to do with the creation of risky loans in the IndyMac loan portfolios,\" Mnuchin reportedly plans to say. \"We did this because we believed in our ability to rebuild and create a successful regional bank. We believed in recovery for the American economy.\"", "date": "2017/01/18", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/steven-mnuchin-foreclosure-victims-elizabeth-warren", "title": "Foreclosure Victims Say They Were Mistreated by Trump's Treasury Pick"}, {"text": "Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, blasted President-elect Donald Trump's new plan to handle his conflicts of interest on Wednesday. Trump laid out a plan earlier in the day to put his assets in a trust that his adult children control, with Trump receiving little information about the operations of the family business. At an event at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, Shaub said Trump's plan is not sufficient. \"Nothing short of divestiture will resolve these conflicts,\" he said. \"This has been my position from the start.\"  Shaub noted that the arrangement Trump unveiled at a Wednesday press conference should not be compared to a blind trust, which is overseen by an independent trustee who works to sell off assets and reduce conflicts. \"This is not a blind trust,\" Shaub remarked. \"It's not even close. It's not even halfway blind. The only thing it has in common with a blind trust is the label 'trust.'\"  Shaub noted the pile of envelopes Trump had laid out next to the podium during his press event. Trump said each contained a legal agreement separating himself from one of his businesses. The sheer volume of these agreements, Shaub said, underscores the problem. Despite Trump's proposed arrangementwhich was presented at the press conference by a Washington tax lawyer named Sheri DillonShaub suggested it was inevitable that some of these deals would end up posing conflicts.  He acknowledged the president and vice president are exempt from the conflict-of-interest rules that apply to all other federal employees, but he maintained that conflicts can still arise. He pointed out that having a president who voluntarily complies with the rules would set a positive tone and provide the OGE with an ally in enforcing ethics rules throughout the executive branch. Shaub cited a memo on presidents and conflicts of interest written by the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia that concluded that if presidents do not deal with their financial conflicts, they open themselves up to \"damaging criticism.\"  \"The sheer obviousness of Scalia's words become apparent if you just ask yourself one question: Should the president hold himself to a lower standard than his own appointees?\" Shaub said.  Shaub said Trump and his team did not consult him or the OGE while developing the plan. He challenged Dillon's assertion that it would be too expensive and too complicated for Trump to divest all his assets. \"I wish she had spoken to those of us in government who do this for a living,\" he said, pointing to all the other elected officials and federal employees who are forced to divest. Other federal officials have been unhappy about divesting, Shaub said, but \"their basic patriotism usually prevails as they set aside their personal interests.\"  \"It's important to know that the president is now entering a world of public service,\" Shaub said. \"He's going to be asking his appointees to make sacrifices.\" And Trump may well ask members of the military services to make sacrifices, too. \"So, no,\" Shaub said, \"I don't think divestiture is too great a cost to pay to be president of the United States of America.\"", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/government-ethics-watchdog-blasts-trumps-conflict-interest-plan", "title": "Top Government Ethics Official Blasts Trump's Conflict-of-Interest Plan"}, {"text": "At a long-awaited press conference Wednesday, Donald Trump outlined an extensive list of steps he plans to take to separate himself from his business interests. But he stopped short of the one thing that ethics experts agree he needs to do to eliminate conflicts of interest: divest his billions in assets and debts and place the proceeds in a blind trust.  Standing in front of a large stack of papers and manila folders that he said represented agreements he has signed to separate himself from his businesses, Trump steadfastly insisted he did not have to take any measures to avoid conflicts because federal ethics rules do not apply to presidents or vice presidents. According to Trump and a lawyer he retained to devise a plan to limit his business conflicts, he was voluntarily taking steps to make sure there are no questions about whether he is acting in the public interest while in office. Under the plan detailed at the press conference, Trump's assets will be placed into a trust that will be run by his sons and another Trump executive, and all of the Trump Organization's deals will be vetted by an ethics adviser who will have the right to veto any new deals that might present a conflict.  But the Trump trust will not be a blind trustthat is, an entity run by an independent third party containing assets the beneficiary is unaware of. It will just be a trust. Many of Trump's assets are already in a trustthe Donald J. Trump Revocable Trustbut according to Trump and his attorney, Sheri Dillon, he won't play a role in managing the new trust. Dillon said Trump will not be provided with detailed statements showing how his companies are performing. He will just receive updates showing the profits or losses of his assets.  \"Tragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect.\"  Dillon also attempted to stave off concerns that Trump might violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving financial benefits from a foreign government. Ethics experts have pointed out that Trump's financial entanglements may violate this provision. Among other things, he is part of a partnership that owes money to a government-owned Chinese bank. And foreign diplomatic delegations have rushed to book space at Trump's new Washington, DC, hotelseen by many as an attempt to curry favor. According to Dillon, Trump will donate all hotel profits connected to any foreign government to the US Treasury.  None of Trump's proposals seemed to impress his critics. Norm Eisen, who served as a lead ethics attorney in Barack Obama's administration, said the plan laid out by Trump and Dillon fails all five standards that he and Richard Painter, a former ethics attorney for the George W. Bush administration, laid out prior to the press conference.  \"Tragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect,\" Eisen said, calling it \"an inadequate and scantily detailed ethics wall.\"  \"Mr. Trump's ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption,\" Eisen added.  One of Trump's most intractable conflicts of interest is the debt he owes to lenders around the globe. Trump has reported owing $713 million. His biggest lender is Deutsche Bank, the troubled German bank that recently agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement with the Justice Department for its role in the 2008 mortgage crisis. The bank remains under investigation by the Justice Department for possibly participating in an attempt to funnel money out of Moscow in defiance of international sanctions. Trump did not address the loans other than to say he believed his company has very little debt.  As he left the stage, Trump said he was happy to leave his sons in charge of his business empire and that he will judge how they have performed when he leaves the White House. \"I hope they do a good job,\" Trump said in closing, \"but if they don't a good job, I'll say, 'You're fired!'\"", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trumps-plan-will-not-eliminate-his-conflicts", "title": "Trump's Business Plan Won't Eliminate His Conflicts of Interest"}, {"text": "Congressional Democrats filed new legislation on Monday in both the House and Senate that would force Donald Trump and future presidents to obey the same strict conflict-of-interest laws governing other federal officials.  In 11 days, Trump is poised to enter the White House with unprecedented conflicts. His public disclosures of his personal finances show interests in hundreds of businesses, billions in assets, and more than $700 million in debtsincluding entanglements with foreign investors and lenders. Trump has said he will only step back from overseeing the businesses he owns, but he has so far declined to divest any of his assets (or the debts attached to them), citing the fact that federal conflict-of-interest laws exempt the president and vice president. The legislation introduced by congressional Democrats would remove this exemption and categorize a violation of conflict-of-interest regulations as an impeachable offense.  Democrats have hammered Trump over his conflicts, but with little Republican support they have so far failed to get much traction. The new legislation will face similar hurdlesRepublicans are unlikely to allow the measure to even come to a votebut it could serve as a pressure point on Republicans who have been dodging the issue.  \"The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the lead Democrat sponsoring the Senate's version of the bill. \"This has been the standard for previous presidents, and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same.\"  In addition to requiring the president to transfer his conflict-causing assets into a blind trust overseen by an independent trustee, the bill would prohibit presidential appointees from working on any issue that would benefit the financial interests of the president and the president's immediate family. In Trump's case, such a provision could block his appointees from matters ranging from Justice Department settlement talks with Deutsche Bank (Trump's biggest lender) to foreign policy decisions involving countries, such as Turkey, where the Trump Organization has business interests. The legislation also folds in a measure, previously sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), that would require the sitting president and nominees of the major parties to publicly release their tax records.  Watchdog groups that have been calling for Trump to take action applauded the legislation.  \"A second-grader could see that the only solution to this pervasive problem is for President-elect Trump to sell off the family business,\" said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen. \"Because there is no sign he intends to do this, it is incumbent on the Congress to force him to do so.

Former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned after revelations that he had privately talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about the sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for its hacking of political targets during the 2016 election to aid Donald Trump. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from Justice Department or FBI investigations involving Russia and the Trump campaign after he was caught falsely claiming he had not interacted with Russian officials during the campaign, when he was a top Trump adviser. (He, too, had met with Kislyak.) News reports keep yielding more information indicating Trump associates were in contact with Russian officials and possibly Russian intelligence. Reportedly there is at least one FBI investigation on this front; the House and Senate intelligence committees have each launched their own probes. And this past weekend, Trump had a Twitter meltdown and hurled the unsubstantiated Breitbart-born accusation that Obama had illegally spied on him in Trump Tower. It is becoming tough to track all the developments, as the story becomes more complicated and the prospects for a long and complex investigation increase. But there is a simple question that might be easy to answer and that could cut to the chase.  What happened during Flynn's conversations with Kislyak before the election?  One fundamental issue in this scandal is what interactions occurred between Trump and his associates and Vladimir Putin's regime and its agents. Trump and his political aides have repeatedly insisted there were no communications between the Trump camp and Russians during the campaign. Days after the electionin response to news reports quoting Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying that \"there were contacts\" between the Trump team and the KremlinTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks claimed the campaign had \"no contact with Russian officials\" before the election. After the conclusion of a January 11 press conference, Trump insisted his campaign had no contact with Russia. At a February 14 White House briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer asserted there had been no communications between the Trump campaign and Russians. And Trump has frequently declaredas he did at a press conference last month\"I have nothing to do with Russia.\" (That is false. Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and he held the Miss Universe contest, which he owned until 2015, in Moscow, in partnership with oligarch Aras Agalarov, with whom Trump was pursuing other deals in Russia.)  The public record contradicts the denials of the Trump crew. Flynn, Sessions, onetime Trump foreign policy advisers Carter Page and J.D. Gordon, and former campaign manager Paul Manafort each had some degree of contact with Russian officials during the campaign. Perhaps the most intriguing interaction involved Flynn.  When the Washington Post broke the news that Flynn had spoken with Kislyak during the transition, the newspaper's reporters spoke to the Russian ambassador, who revealed a fact that has not received sufficient public attention: Flynn and Kislyak were in communication prior to Election Day. This statement belied all the Trump camp claims that there had been no hobnobbing with the Russians during the campaign. But the implications run deeper.  Beginning in early June, there were news reports that the Russians were behind the hacking of Democratic targets that led to the public release, through WikiLeaks and other outlets, of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. (In October, emails swiped from Clinton campaign CEO John Podesta would be released.) In late July, Obama said that \"experts have attributed this [hack] to the Russians.\" In mid-August, Trump, as the GOP nominee, received an intelligence briefing that noted that Moscow was behind the hacks and leaks. Flynn attended that briefing. On September 7, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, pointed to Obama's July statement and added, \"The Russians hack our systems all the time, not just government but also corporate and personal systems.\" A month later, Clapper's office and the Department of Homeland Security released a statement stating that Moscow was definitely the culprit.  So from the start of June until Election Day, it was widely noted that the Russians were either the likely perps or the guilty partythat is, Putin's government had conducted a secret operation to influence an American election. Though it would take the intelligence community until after the election to reach the conclusion that this scheme was mounted to benefit Trump, it did seem obvious throughout the campaign season that Clinton was being harmed by the operation and Trump was being helped.  All this means that when Flynn was talking to Kislyakor any other Russian government officialsduring the campaign, he was in contact with a foreign power waging political warfare against the United States and had reason to suspect or know this. And throughout the summer and fall campaign, Flynn, who was already cozy with Moscow (having accepted a speaking fee to hang out with Putin at a Moscow gala for RT in December 2015), was Trump's most senior foreign policy aide. (He was given a prime speaking spot at the Republican National Convention.)  What was Flynn, this prominent and important Trump adviser, saying to Kislyak during this stretch? The ambassador refused to tell the Washington Post what he and Flynn discussed. Was Flynn firmly telling the Russians to cease meddling in US politics? Did they discuss the hacking at all? Or perhaps Flynn was signaling to Moscow that Putin would get a better deal if Trump were elected. If Flynn uttered to Kislyak anything of that natureor even if he ducked the issue of the hackingMoscow could have read this as encouragement for its covert operation to undermine the US election.  There has been speculation that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow on the hacking/leaking plot. (Clapper this weekend said he had seen no evidence of such collusion but noted it was possible evidence might have emerged since he left the government in January.) But communications between the Trump camp and the Russian government need not have been so explicit to qualify as outrageous and improper. On the campaign trail, Trump had praised Putin, refused to acknowledge the Russian hack, and raised the possibility of easing the sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. If Flynn was reinforcing Trump's pro-Putin message in his private chats with Kislyak, that would have been reassuring for Moscow and might possibly have emboldened a regime as it was assaulting the US electoral system.  Flynn's pre-election communications with Kislyak could be far more significant than his conversations during the transition about the Obama sanctions that prompted his firing. Investigators working the Trump-Russia beat should zero in on this. Flynn should be asked when exactly he was gabbing with the Russian ambassador during the campaign. Phone and text records ought to be reviewed. There might be transcripts of these discussions, for Kislyak was routinely spied on by the US intelligence community. (That's why Flynn got caught lying about his talks with the Russian ambassador during the transition.)  There is plenty of muck for investigators and reporters to be raking regarding the Trump team's interactions with Russia. It is evident that there were contacts during the campaignand that Trump and his lieutenants have repeatedly dissembled about this. And Flynn may well be one key to figuring out what was going on. In recent days, Sessions' two acknowledged interactions with Kislyak have drawn much notice. As much scrutiny should be applied to Flynn's pre-election communications with the Russian. It might just offer a path to solving the riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/one-simple-question-could-break-trump-russia-scandal-wide-open", "title": "One Simple Question That Could Break the Trump-Russia Scandal Wide Open"}, {"text": "When it comes to the Trump-Russia scandal, most congressional Republicans would rather run away from reporters than talk about this controversy, let alone take any action.  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan routinely duck questions about the matter. The GOPers chairing the House and Senate intelligence committees had to be pressured to mount investigations of the contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials (and it's unclear how thorough these probes will be). Republicans who chair other committees that could dig into parts of this storysay, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the ever-ready-to-investigate-Democrats chair of the House oversight committeetrudge along in nothing-to-see-here mode. True, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have called for a robust inquiry, and Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) recently said it's time for a special prosecutor (and then on Monday backtracked). Generally, though, the Republican Party has fiercely ignored the Trump-Moscow connection.  But now House Democrats have devised a plan to put Republicans on the spot, and their scheme kicks in this week.  \"They are trying to aid and abet a cover-up by limiting debate_Using extreme measures to stop this inquiry is collusion.\"  It started February 9, when Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced in the House what's known as a resolution of inquiry. This measure requested that Attorney General Jeff Sessions share with the House information the Justice Department (including the FBI) possesses related to several issues: any investigations of Trump associates' interactions with a foreign power; any investment by a foreign government or agent in an entity wholly or partly owned by Donald Trump; and any financial conflicts of interest affecting Trump. This legislation would cover information the FBI might have gathered on recently departed national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone.  The minority party in the House has little ability to pass legislation or shape debates. But a resolution of inquiry is special. Under House rules, it must be considered by the relevant committee. If not, within 14 business days it goes straight to the House floor for debate and a vote. With his move, Nadler was forcing Republicans to vote on whether information related to the Trump-Russia connection and the president's financial conflicts should be made available to House members.  The GOPers did have a choice in how they could respond. They could refer Nadler's measure to the judiciary committee, where the Republican majority would presumably vote it down. Or they could let it go to the House floor, where Republicans would also presumably vote it down.  The difference? If a resolution of inquiry is kicked to a committee, there must, under the rules, be a debate prior to the vote. That would mean that Democrats on the committee, including Nadler, would have a high-profile platform for posing uncomfortable questions to the Republicans before compelling them to vote on all this stuff.  If, on the other hand, a resolution of inquiry is sent to the House floor, the Republican leadership can suppress any debate, but a much larger number of Republicans would then have to vote on the proposal. In this case, that would entail going on record as protecting Trump on these dicey fronts. Either way, Nadler would force some Republicans to take an uncomfortable vote.  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) eventually decided it would be better for the GOP to bottle up the resolution in the judiciary committee. Late last week, the Republicans notified Nadler that the resolution would be considered by the committee on Tuesday, while the committee would also be deliberating on two medical malpractice bills, on the day Trump would be addressing Congress and dominating the news.  What's more, the Republicans cooked up a nifty plan to limit Nadler's ability to mount a full-scale debate on the interactions between Trump associates and Russia. Nadler heard that the chair of the committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), intended to submit as a substitute for his bill an amendment that would be identical to Nadler's measure. Identical? Why would that help the Republicans? With this maneuver, Goodlatte might be able to control the debate on the resolution and only allow Nadler five minutes of speaking time while preventing the other 16 Democrats on the committee from participating in the debate. Committee Republicans would still have to vote on the resolution. But the Democrats would not get as much of a P.R. boost.  \"They are trying to aid and abet a cover-up by limiting debate,\" Nadler tells me. \"This is highly irregular and maybe unprecedented. We know the Russians tried to influence the election. And we know now officials of the Trump campaign were in contact with Russians_Using extreme measures to stop this inquiry is collusion.\"  Even if Goodlatte succeeds in quashing debate, the committee's GOP members will still have to go on record as opposing or supporting the resolution of inquiry. Yet from the GOP perspective, the potential damage will be limited, with no other lawmakers outside the committee having to vote against the resolution. (The Republicans on the judiciary committee tend to be from conservative districts and hold safe seats.)  Whatever happens on Tuesday, Nadler says this won't be the end of his plot. He notes that additional resolutions of inquiry can be introduced that would be designed to land in other committees. That would force other Republicans to vote on the Trump controversies. Nadler vows he will do all he can to keep House Republicans on the hot seat regarding Trump's Russia scandal and his financial conflicts. Which means this congressional version of hide-and-seek may well continue.  UPDATE: On Tuesday, the House judiciary committee, divided along party lines, voted down Nadler's resolution of inquiry 18-16. Politico reports, \"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) called the resolution 'unnecessary, premature' and driven by politics. Instead, he said Republican members of the committee are drafting a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting his voluntary cooperation in any investigation related to Russia and Trumps business conflicts.\" Chaffetz and Issa also voted against the measure. During the debate, Nadler said, \"Each day, more questions arise concerning President Trumps foreign business entanglements and his inexplicably cozy relationship with Russia. Each day, Democrats on this Committee, and on other committees, have requested hearings and investigations into these serious issues. And yet, each day, with a few exceptions, we have been met with a deafening silence from our Republican colleagues.\"", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/congress-russia-trump-nadler-republicans-house-update", "title": "How Democrats Are Trying to Corner GOPers on the Trump-Russia Scandal"}, {"text": "Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr and Senate armed services committee chairman John McCain  Last week, news broke that the Senate intelligence committeeas part of its recently launched investigation of both the Russian hacking of the 2016 campaign and contacts between Donald Trump associates and Russiahad sent letters to at least a dozen agencies, individuals, and organizations instructing them to preserve records and information related to the probe. This was one of the first public signs that the Senate committee or the House intelligence committee, which has initiated its own inquiry, had begun any real digging.  But both investigations are proceeding behind a thick veil of secrecy, and there is no way to tell if the Republicans leading these efforts are mounting serious endeavors committed to unearthing facts that might be inconvenient, embarrassing, delegitimizing, or worse for Trump and his White House. So the question remains: Can these committees be trusted to get the job done?  Congressional spokespeople wouldn't say if either committee has yet issued any subpoenas. Or if they will release public updates. This is a red flag.  Congressional investigations are not easy tasks. Committees usually are burdened with a wide variety of responsibilities. In the case of the intelligence committees, they are already responsible for monitoring the full intelligence community, which includes 17 different agencies. Veteran members and staffers from these committees routinely say that it's tough for them to manage the normal oversight. (Watching over just the gigantic National Security Agency could keep a committee busy around the clock.)  Now, these committees have to maintain their current overwhelming duties and also conduct a highly sensitive inquiry. One congressional source says that the House intelligence committee has slightly expanded its staff for the hacking/Trump-Russia investigation. But Jack Langer, the spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the committee, won't confirm that. And spokespeople for Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, did not even respond to a request for comment on the staffing issue.  Langer and the Burr spokespeople also wouldn't say if the House and Senate intelligence committees are coordinating their efforts. Or if either committee has yet issued any subpoenas. Or if the committees will release public updates on the progress of each investigation. This is a red flag. Questions such as these do not involve classified or secret information. The committees could demonstrate their commitment to full accountability by informing the public about these organizational issues. The desire to shield such details does not bode well.  Jeremy Bash, who was chief counsel for the House intelligence committee in 2007 and 2008 (when Democrats controlled Congress), notes that there are three key elements necessary to ensure the intelligence committees conduct an effective investigation: full-time staff with legal or investigative training devoted to the inquiry; access for members and staff to all relevant documents held by government agencies; and a vigorous effort to conduct a broad range of witness interviews. He points out that past intelligence committee investigations have been hindered when intelligence agencies have not allowed staffers easy access to materials. Indeed, the intelligence committees often get into tussles with the spy services they oversee. Three years ago, the Senate intelligence committee had an explosive fight with the CIA over documents when it was examining the agency's use of torture. This bitter clash threatened to blow up into a full-scale constitutional crisis.  News reports about the Trump-Russia scandal indicate that US intelligence agencies have materialperhaps surveillance intercepts or reports from human assetsrelating to contacts between Trump associates and Russians. The FBI reportedly has been investigating these contacts and presumably has collected information relevant to the committees' inquiries. Yet often intelligence agencies, looking to protect sources and methods or an ongoing investigation, are reluctant to share such informationeven with the committees. (Democratic senators and representatives have repeatedly called on the FBI to release to the public information it has on Trump-Russia interactions.)  Much depends on the chairmen of the two committees. How hard will they push if they encounter a roadblock at the FBI or elsewhere? And how far will they go? Will they devote sufficient resources? Will they issue subpoenas for witnesses not eager to accept a committee invitation? A chairman has much discretion in determining the course of an investigation. Imagine that a staffer has located a witness who might possess significant information but that this witness is now living in South Korea. Will the chairman send staff there to locate the witness and obtain a statement? Or might he say, We have to let this one go?  \"The real enemy to an investigation is the time that goes by.\"  The most crucial element is how committed the chairman is to uncovering the truth. \"The real enemy to an investigation is the time that goes by,\" says Bash, who helped oversee an investigation of the NSA's warrantless wiretapping during his time with the house committee. \"People lose interest. Other events intervene. The key thing is to get going fast. There are a hundred ways to slow down an investigation by people or agencies who don't want it.\"  Neither Burr nor Nunes has demonstrated much public enthusiasm for investigating the Trump-Russia scandal. At first, Burr wanted his committee to focus solely on the Russia hacking, not ties between Trump associates and Russia. This was no surprise. Most congressional Republicans have either shied away from or downplayed this subject. And Burr did serve on the Trump campaign's national security advisory council. But after Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pushed for a select committee investigationwhich would be a more independent inquiry involving a greater number of senatorsBurr agreed to widen the intelligence committee probe to cover the Trump-Russia angle. It was obvious that he did so in order not to lose control of the investigation.  Nunes, who was an adviser to Trump's transition team, initially showed little eagerness for this assignment, as well His announcement in late January that he would proceed with the investigation came only after Burr's change of heartand followed weeks of public pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff, (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee. Skepticism regarding the willingness of Burr or Nunes to lead robust, wherever-it-goes investigations is hardly unfounded.  On Friday, the Washington Post reportedand the White House confirmedthat Burr and Nunes had been enlisted by the Trump administration to be part of its effort to counter news stories about Trump associates' ties to Russia. Their participation in this spin campaign has undermined their claims of independence. And on Saturdayin response to Rep. Darrell Issa's (R-Calif.) surprising call for a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump-Russia connectionsNunes dismissed Issa's demand, saying, \"This is almost like McCarthyism revisited. Were going to go on a witch hunt against, against innocent Americans?\" He added, \"At this point, there's nothing there.\" That's not the manner in which the head of an independent investigation should be talking about the inquiry. How does Nunes know who's innocent or notor whether there's nothing thereat this point?  In recent weeks, Democratic members of both committees told me that, at least for the time being, they were hoping for the best and taking Burr and Nunes at their word when they claim they are committed to conducting thorough investigations, holding public hearings, and releasing public findings. These recent actions of Burr and Nunes may change that perspective. Schiff has said he will release public updates on the progress of the House committee's inquiry, though he has not issued one yet.  Democrats are calling for an independent bipartisan commissionsimilar to the well-regarded 9/11 commissionto investigate this affair.  On the Senate side, Democrats say that the effectiveness of the investigation may depend on McCain. He is not a full member of the Senate intelligence committee, but as chair of the Senate armed services committee, he is an ex officio member of the intelligence committee. In that regard, he has the same access as a full member to the investigation's materials, and he can monitor the inquiry. Should he conclude the investigation is not proceeding vigorously, he will be in a position to publicly shame Burr and revive his demand for a select committee probe. Of course, Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees could do the same, but they won't have the same political standing to pull that sort of move.  For weeks, Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill have called for an independent bipartisan commissionsimilar to the well-regarded 9/11 commissionto investigate this affair. This inquiry would operate outside of the congressional committee systemmeaning outside of GOP control. Naturally, the Republican congressional leadership has opposed the move and has declared that it's just fine to let the intelligence committees do their work. And McCain and Graham have yet to endorse the Democrats' proposal. But that is a card McCain could play if the Senate investigation does not meet his standards. Still, every time there is a development in the Trump-Russia storysuch as last week when it was reported that the Trump White House asked the FBI to knock down the news stories saying that Trump associates had interacted with Russian intelligenceDemocrats renew their call for an independent commission that would be distant from congressional politics.  Even with the FBI investigating, the congressional investigations are crucial. The FBI inquiry is either a counterintelligence probe or a criminal investigation (or maybe both). Neither of those are designed or intended to provide a full accounting to the public. An FBI criminal inquiry (usually) only yields public information if someone ends up being charged with a crime and the case goes to trial. And in such instances, the only information that emerges is material necessary for the prosecution of the case. That could be a small slice of whatever the bureau obtained.  A counterintelligence investigation aims to discover and possibly counter a foreign actor's effort to target the United States with espionage, covert action, or terrorism. These sort of probes tend to stay secret unless they result in a criminal case. (Perhaps a spy is discovered and arrested, or a would-be terrorist indicted.) In an unusual move, the intelligence community, at President Barack Obama's direction, did release some of its assessments regarding the Russia hacking. But whatever the FBI and other intelligence agencies may be investigating, their efforts are not likely to produces a comprehensive public accounting of this double scandal: Vladimir Putin's attack on the US election and the interactions between the president's crew and the foreign power that waged this political warfare.  As of now, that's the job of the two congressional intelligence committees. Both are under the direction of Republicans who have supported Trump and participated in White House spin efforts. Both are moving forward cloaked by their customary secrecy. And both have yielded no indications yet that they will produce the investigations and public findings necessary to resolve these grave matters.  UPDATE: At a press conference on Monday morning, Nunes said that his committee has only completed \"the scoping of our investigation\" and has not yet begun gathering evidence.", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/congress-intelligence-committees-trump-russia", "title": "Can Republicans Be Trusted to Investigate Trump's Russia Scandal?"}, {"text": "There is an old chestnut that gets tossed out whenever a scandal hits: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. The saying traces back to Watergate. Sen. Howard Baker, the top Republican on the Senate Watergate committee, once noted, \"It is almost always the cover-up rather than the event that causes trouble.\" This week, following the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, NBC News' Chuck Todd was one of many who quipped, \"It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.\" And that was certainly a significant element of the Flynn imbroglio: Flynn had lied about his December conversation with the Russian ambassador, concealing the fact that they had discussed the sanctions President Barack Obama had just levied on Russia as punishment for its covert efforts to swing the 2016 election to Trump. But in this case the bigger scandal at hand is not a cover-up. It is the thing itself: the connections between the Trump camp and Moscow during the campaign, when Vladimir Putin was trying to subvert American democracy.  Certainly, the Trump campaign has strived mightily to smother this potentially explosive scandal. Here's a partial account.  * Days after the election, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview that \"there were contacts\" between the Trump team and the Kremlin. He noted, \"Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage.\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks immediately said the campaign had \"no contact with Russian officials\" before the election.  * At Trump's January 11 press conference, a reporter asked him, \"Can you stand here today, once and for all, and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign?\" Trump did not reply. But after the press conference ended and Trump was leaving, he did answer that query with a firm \"no.\"  * On January 15, on Face the Nation, John Dickerson asked incoming Vice President Mike Pence, \"Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?\" Pence declared, \"Of course not. And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.\"  * On February 14, at the daily White House briefing, ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked press secretary Sean Spicer whether any Trump associates were in touch with the Russian government prior to the election. Spicer replied, \"There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.\" That contorted statement was clearly meant as a no.  The drift is clear. Whenever queried about this highly sensitive matter, Trump and his minions have said there were no contacts between anyone in his crew and the Putin regime during the 2016 campaign. This is a cover-up.  There is evidence that Trump associates did interact with Russian officials during the campaign. The Washington Post story that broke open the Flynn affair a few days ago also reported that the Russian ambassador had told the newspaper he had been communicating with Flynn during the campaign. At that point, Flynn was Trump's senior national security adviser. (As such, Flynn attended in mid-August the first briefing Trump received as the GOP nominee from the US intelligence community, during which Trump and Flynn were told that US intelligence agencies had concluded Russia was behind the hacking and leaking that targeted Democrats.) And on Tuesday night, the New York Times reported that intelligence intercepts indicated that several Trump associates had \"repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\"  In late October, I reported that a former foreign counterintelligence officer had sent memos to the FBI indicating that the \"Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years\" and that Trump \"and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.\" The memos also claimed that Russian intelligence had \"compromised\" Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \"blackmail him,\" and that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on \"bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.\"  On Tuesday, I bumped into a prominent Republican consultant, and he said that Trump had to \"get out in front of\" the burgeoning scandal and disclose all the facts because \"the cover-up is always worse.\" The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza offered similar advice to the president on Wednesday morning: \"What is really needed at this point is a full and complete debrief for the American people from Trump himself. Why was his campaign in 'constant' contact with Russian officials? Who in the campaignor the broader Trump organizationwas involved? Are they still with the campaign or the business? What was discussed on these calls?_Why is Trump so reluctant to condemn Russia and Vladimir Putin in particular?\"  But the cover-up here may not be worse than the actions being covered up.  At a minimum, it seems that Trump associatesat least Flynnwere secretly interacting with the Putin regime as it was plotting to subvert American democracy to help Trump win the White House. A key question is obvious: What did they discuss? The darkest possibility is that they talked about the Kremlin assault on the US election. Short of that, might Flynn or others have encouraged Putin's clandestine operation by signaling that Moscow would have an easier time with a Trump administration than with a Clinton administration? Were there any winks or nods? After all, in late July, Trump called on Russia to hack Clinton. Whatever was discussed, any Trump associate who spoke with Russian officials during the summer or fall of the campaign had reason to know that he or she was interacting with a member of a regime that was actively attempting to undermine the election in a manner beneficial to Trump.  The cover-up here may not be worse than the actions being covered up.  How can Trump and his crew concede that they were hobnobbing with a foreign government that was waging political warfare against the United States? The \"full and complete debrief\" that Cillizza advocates would require Trump to acknowledge that he and his team have covered up these contacts and explain why. This \"full and complete debrief\" could well show that Trump's camp cozied up to a repressive government that was seeking to destabilize US politics to help Trump. It could reveal that Trump associates directly or indirectly encouraged Putin's attack on the 2016 election.  Trump would lose all legitimacy as president were he to admit that anything of this sort transpired. There are some deeds that cannot be acknowledged. Expecting Trump and his lieutenants to confess that his campaign or business associates were networking with the Kremlin or Russian intelligence is not realisticespecially after their months of denial. (Trump also for months refused to accept the US intelligence assessment that Russia was behind the hacking and leaking aimed at Democratic targets, and when he finally bent on this point, he downplayed Moscow's meddling in the election.) Trump cannot continue to present himself as the triumphant winner of a fair election if it turns out his own people were palling around with Moscow.  Another famous line is this: You can't handle the truth. Further revelations about contacts between the Trump camp and Russia could pose an existential threat to the Trump White House. The clear choice for him and his gang is to deny, to stonewall, to distract, to lie. Trump doesn't explain the pre-election contacts; he complains about leaks. He casts all interest in this controversy as merely the revenge of the Clinton losers. He calls reporting on the Russia connection \"fake news\" and slams journalists pursuing the Flynn story as \"fake media.\" This is not shocking. He might not be able to survive a full accounting. The poison of the cover-up may be less deadly than the poison of the event itself. Only Trump and the people involved can know for sure. But investigations of the Russian contacts now being conducted by the FBI and the congressional intelligence committeesif they are mounted effectively and yield public resultsmay eventually allow us to see the full calculation. In the meantime, the public can justifiably conclude that when it comes to Trump-Russia connections during the campaign, the Trump team has been covering up for very good reasons.", "date": "2017/02/15", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/donald-trump-cant-come-clean-on-russia-michael-flynn", "title": "Why Trump Can't Come Clean on Russia"}, {"text": "The first question at White House press secretary Sean Spicer's daily briefing on Tuesdayhalf a day after the news broke that national security adviser Michael Flynn had resignedfocused on a key issue: Flynn's contacts with the Vladimir Putin regime during the campaign. Flynn has been under fire for his post-election conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during which he discussed the sanctions President Barack Obama was imposing on Russia as punishment for Moscow's meddling in the US election. But ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked whether any Trump associates were in touch with the Russian government before the election.  This is important, for that would mean that Trump folks were in contact with the Putin regime while it was attacking American democracy. Trump and his team have adamantly denied there were any interactions with Russian officials. At a press conference in mid-January, Trump ignored a question about such contacts. Once the event was over, he said, \"No contact.\" Days later, on Face the Nation, incoming Vice President Mike Pence said the Trump campaign had no interactions with Moscow. Host John Dickerson asked him, \"Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?\" Pence declared, \"Of course not. And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.\"  Yet the Washington Post reported days ago that Kislyak told the newspaper he had been in touch with Flynn since before the election. The ambassador declined to say what he and Flynn had discussed. And the newspaper reported that the Flynn-Kislyak conversations \"were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said.\" These facts and Kislyak's comment undercut Trump's and Pence's assertions there were no pre-election contacts.  So what was Spicer to say when Karl posed this query? At first, Spicer said that Flynn did speak to the Russian ambassador during the transition. No, Karl protested, that's not the question. What about before the election? Spicer then sputtered out this reply: \"There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.\"  That contorted reply would seem to mean that the White House is sticking to its previous denial. But this assertion runs contrary to what is now the public record: that the Trump campaign was in contact with Putin's man in Washington while Putin was subverting an American election to help Trump. What was going on? What was said? What messages did Flynn send to the Putin regime? These are the obvious questions that warrant answers. They are also dangerous questions for Trump. And that's why Spicer cannot acknowledge the hard truth that the Flynn scandal started before the election. These contacts deserve as much, if not more, attention than the conversations that triggered this controversy, for they are relevant to the fundamental subject at hand: Trump's relationship with the autocratic leader who mounted an operation to subvert American democracy to assist Trump.  Update, 2/15/17: It turns out it's not just Flynn. Citing multiple current and former US officials, the New York Times reported Tuesday evening that multiple Trump campaign officials and other Trump associates \"had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\" According to the Times report, one of those involved was Paul Manafort, who chaired Trump's campaign from April to August of 2016. Manafort has denied the allegation, telling the Times that it is \"absurd.\"", "date": "2017/02/14", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sean-spicer-ducks-question-about-trump-campaign-contacts-with-russia", "title": "The Question the White House Won't Answer: Did Trump's Campaign Have Contact With Russia?"}, {"text": "With Michael Flynn's resignation, the Flynn story is not doneand neither is the need for an investigation of Flynn and his contacts with Russia.  Late on Monday night, Flynn, President Donald Trump's combative and controversial national security adviser, quit his post, after days of incoming fire following a Washington Post report that he had lied about his December contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. After news of his conversations with the Russian broke last month, Flynn insisted that they had not discussed the sanctions imposed on Moscow by President Barack Obama as punishment for the operation ordered by Vladimir Putin to influence the 2016 election and help Trump. And Flynn had apparently made this claim to Vice President Mike Pence, who days before the inauguration publicly asserted Flynn's communications with Kislyak were innocent. (A widespread assumption was that Flynn had privately indicated to the Russian ambassador that the Trump administration would dial back the sanctions.)  But Flynn had pulled a dumb move, because, as he should have known, US intelligence was intercepting the communications of Kislyak, and transcripts of their chats indicated Flynn and the Russian had indeed talked about the sanctions. And these transcripts were shared among various US government agencies. Before Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for not enforcing his Muslim travel ban, last month she warned the Trump White House that Flynn had misrepresented the calls and was therefore vulnerable to Russian blackmail. That warning was enough reason for Trump to boot Flynn, but he did not. It took the increasing criticism of Flynn and the mounting calls for an investigation of recent days for the White House to request that Flynn find another perch for his anti-Islam crusade.  Flynn's departure should not end the demands for an investigation. One tantalizing and somewhat overlooked aspect of the Post story that did him in was the fact that Flynn hobnobbed with Kislyak during the campaign. The paper reported that the Flynn-Kislyak conversations \"were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the November 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said.\" And the paper noted, \"Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed.\"  This is the mystery that now needs an answer: What was Flynn talking about with the Russians during the campaign?  In January, Pence declared that the Trump campaign had no interactions with Moscow. On Face the Nation, host John Dickerson asked him, \"Did any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?\" Pence was unequivocal: \"Of course not. And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.\"  Then consider credence granted, for now there is evidence that Trump's senior campaign adviser on national security was in regular contact with Putin's man in Washington. Flynn's pre-election interactions with Kislyak occurred while Moscow was attacking American democracy with its secret operation to subvert the election via hacking and leaking (and more) to boost Trump's prospects. And Flynn knew about thisbecause US intelligence told the Trump campaign about Russia's meddling in the summer, months before it publicly declared that Moscow had hacked the campaign.  When the news first emerged in June that the Democratic National Committee had been cyber-penetrated, private cyber experts immediately concluded that Russian intelligence was the culprit. Trump and his campaign, though, refused to acknowledge that. But on August 17, Trump, as the GOP presidential nominee, began receiving briefings from the US intelligence committee. And the material presented to him included the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was meddling in the US election. Flynn was with Trump for this briefing. So whatever was being reported in the media, as of mid-August, Flynn knew that US intelligence believed Moscow was trying to undermine the election. And on October 7, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement publicly announcing this conclusion.  This means that during the campaign, Flynn, a high-ranking Trump aide, was knowingly talking with a senior official of a regime that was trying to undermine the election to benefit Trump. So what did they chat about? Did Flynn warn Kislyak not to mess with US democracy? Or did he give the Russians reasons to prefer Trump over Hillary Clinton and, consequently, more motivation for their covert efforts to nudge the election toward Trump?  What Flynn told Kislyak during the campaign could be much more important than their discussions about the sanctions prior to the inauguration. There is a possibility that Flynn, acting on behalf of the Trump campaign, signaled to Putin that his decision to assist Trump was on the money. Of course, there are even darker possibilities of more direct collusion.  Flynn cannot be allowed to fade away to some consulting or lobbying job (or Fox News post). The Senate and House intelligence committees are currently investigating the Russian hacking and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Flynn should be at the top of the to-do list of the committees' gumshoes. But other committees in Congressthe foreign relations panels, the government oversight committeesshould also focus on Flynn's interactions with Moscow. And if the FBI is still on this beatit's unclear what sort of investigation the bureau is running related to the 2016 electionits agents ought to zero in on Flynn's contacts with the Putin regime throughout the election. (Flynn in December 2015 was paid to attend a gala in Moscow thrown by RT, the Russian state-funded television network, and sat at a table with Putin.)  Flynn, who developed a reputation for pushing his own alternative facts when he ran the Defense Intelligence Agency, has vacated one of the most important and sensitive positions in the US government. But Americans still deserve to know more about what Flynn, a representative of the Trump campaign, was doing with the Russians before Election Day.", "date": "2017/02/14", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/why-michael-flynn-still-needs-to-be-investigated-russia", "title": "Michael Flynn Resigned. Here's Why He Still Needs to be Investigated."}, {"text": "The Trump-Russia scandal has so far resided in the territory between smoke and fire. Donald Trump associates have reportedly been investigated for interactions with Russia, but the FBI has not released information on these contacts. Trump has pushed an America First policy, but he has curiously denied or downplayed the US intelligence conclusion that Vladimir Putin mounted an extensive covert campaign to subvert the 2016 election to benefit Trump and instead has cultivated an odd bromance with the Russian autocrat. A series of memos written by a former counterintelligence officer contained allegations that Russian intelligence had spent years cultivating or co-opting Trump and gathering compromising information on him and that the Trump camp had colluded with Russians, but the specifics have not been confirmed.  Yet now one piece of the Trump-Russia puzzle has been clearly depicted: Trump's national security adviser was in cahoots with Russia to undermine the US government's effort to punish Moscow for hacking the US electionand he apparently lied about it. If Trump does not fire himand if Washington's political-media complex (including Republicans) does not go ballistic over this revelationthen the Putinization of America has taken another big step forward.  On Thursday night, after a long and wild day of Trump news (Trump attacking Sen. John McCain, Kellyanne Conway seemingly breaking the law, an appeals court ruling against Trump's Muslim travel ban, and much more), the Washington Post dropped a bomb: a thoroughly reported article with the headline \"National Security Adviser Flynn Discussed Sanctions With Russian Ambassador, Despite Denials, Officials Say.\" It began:  National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. Flynn's communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.  Here was Flynn working against US policyagainst steps President Barack Obama had ordered in response to Putin's meddling in the US election. He was in essence telling Moscow not to fret over these sanctions and that Russia would be rewarded once Trump moved into the White House. He was explicitly aiding the enemy that had attacked US democracy.  This move was in sync with the approach taken by Trump, who has refused to criticize Russia for intervening in the election. After Trump's first call with Putin as president, the White House accounts of the call contained no indication that Trump had even raised the subject.  Moreover, the Post storywhich was based on interviews with nine current or former officials at security and law enforcement agenciessuggests that Flynn is not honest and not smart.  Since the news first broke weeks ago that Flynn had talked with Kislyak in December, Flynn and the White House have denied that sanctions were discussed. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted Flynn's conversation with Kislyak was about more mundane matters, such as conveying holiday greetings and setting up a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. In an interview with CBS News last month, Vice President Mike Pence asserted, \"They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.\" Pence noted that he had spoken to Flynn about this. If so, it would seem that Flynn lied to him.  The Post reports there is no ambiguity about Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador:  All of those officials said _Flynn's references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president. \"Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,\" said a former official. A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.  Which brings us to the not-very-smart part of this story. How do all these officials know what was really said between Flynn and the Russian? US intelligence routinely conducts surveillance aimed at Russian diplomats and monitors their communications. The Post story clearly indicates that Flynn's conversation with Kislyak was intercepted and that a transcript of it has been passed throughout the intelligence community. Flynn, of course, should have been aware that any discussion he had with the Russian ambassador was vulnerable to surveillance. After all, not too long ago he was head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  This is a scandal. A big scandal. Republicans and Democrats should be screaming for investigations and public hearings.  This makes Flynn's behavior dumb on two counts. First, he should not have explicitly discussed undermining US policy with Kislyak, because he ought to have realized this conversation would be picked up by US intelligence. Second, he should not have told Pence and others that sanctions had not been covered in the conversation, because he should have known there was evidence of what had actually transpired during his chat.  On Wednesday, Flynn denied to the Post that he had discussed the sanctions with Kislyak. The next day, the paper reports, \"Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn 'indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn't be certain that the topic never came up.'\" So he has shifted from an emphatic denial to weasel words. The FBI, according to the paper, is continuing to investigate, though it's unclear if any laws were broken. The Logan Act of 1799 does prohibit US citizens from meddling in US foreign policy matters, but it has never been successfully applied.  Flynn's conversation with Kislyak, it turns out, was part of a series of contacts. And this, too, is suspicious, given Flynn's history of interactions with the Putin regime. In December 2015, he was paid by RT, the English-language propaganda arm of Moscow, to attend a gala, where he sat at a table with Putin. (Flynn has steadfastly refused to say how much he pocketed for this appearance.) The Russian ambassador told the Post that he had been communicating with Flynn since before the election, but he declined to say what they had discussed. Oddly, he would not reveal the origin of his relationship with Flynn.  Last month, Pence declared there had been no contact between the Trump campaign and Russia. \"Of course not,\" he said. \"Why would there be any contact between the campaign? This is all a distraction, and it's all part of a narrative to delegitimatize the election and to question the legitimacy of [Trump's] presidency.\" But when Flynn was talking to Kislyak prior to the election, he was a senior campaign aide and surrogate for Trump. Pence was peddling a falsehood. And this raises the question: Why was Trump's top national security aide talking to Russia while Moscow was attacking the US election to help Trump? What was he signaling to Moscow? What was he being told?  This is a scandal. A real scandal. A big scandal. Republicans and Democrats should be screaming for investigations and public hearings. (Yesterday, House Democrats did resort to a little-used legislative tool to force a debate on both Trump's conflicts of interest and the possible ties between his inner circle and Russia.) And Flynn should be booted. The evidence is strong that he lied and that he cozied up to Moscow while it was assaulting American democracy. Worse, for a supposed national security maven, he acted in a stupid manner and practiced awful tradecraft. Placing the nation's security in his hands of a dishonest and reckless fellow is risky business.  The Trump-Russia story has faded in recent days, amid other Trump chaos. But if this Flynn news does not cause a firestormand threaten Flynn's positionthen something is very rotten in the nation's capital.  UPDATE: On Friday morning, the Trump administration confirmed that Flynn did speak to the Russian ambassador about the sanctions. And Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called for Flynn's dismissal with this statement: \"The allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russias ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trump's behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office. If he did so, and then he and other Administration officials misled the American people, his conduct would be all the more pernicious, and he should no longer serve in this Administration or any other.\"", "date": "2017/02/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/flynn-trump-washington-post-russia", "title": "Bombshell Report Suggests Trump Security Adviser Is Dishonest and a Threat to US Policy"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump speaks to Vladimir Putin by phone on January 28.  The biggest election-related scandal since Watergate occurred last year, and it has largely disappeared from the political-media landscape of Washington.  According to the consensus assessment of US intelligence agencies, Russian intelligence, under the orders of Vladimir Putin, mounted an extensive operation to influence the 2016 campaign to benefit Donald Trump. This was a widespread covert campaign that included hacking Democratic targets and publishing swiped emails via WikiLeaks. And it achieved its objectives. But the nation's capital remains under-outraged by this subversion. The congressional intelligence committees announced last month that they will investigate the Russian hacking and also examine whether there were any improper contacts between the Trump camp and Russia during the campaign. (A series of memos attributed to a former British counterintelligence officer included allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.) Yet these behind-closed-doors inquiries have generated minimum media notice, and, overall, there has not been much outcry.  Certainly, every once in a while, a Democratic legislator or one of the few Republican officials who have bothered to express any disgust at the Moscow meddling (namely Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio) will pipe up. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi days ago called on the FBI to investigate Trump's \"financial, personal and political connections to Russia\" to determine \"the relationship between Putin, whom he admires, and Donald Trump.\" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), responding to Trump's comparison of the United States to Putin's repressive regime, said on CNN, \"What is this strange relationship between Putin and Trump? And is there something that the Russians have on him that is causing him to say these really bizarre things on an almost daily basis?\" A few weeks ago, Graham told me he wanted an investigation of how the FBI has handled intelligence it supposedly has gathered on ties between Trump insiders and Russia. And last month, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) pushed FBI Director James Comey at a public hearing to release this information. Yet there has been no drumbeat of sound bites, tweets, or headlines. In recent days, the story has gone mostly dark.  Look at the White House daily press briefings. Since Trump entered office, there has been far more back-and-forth between reporters and Press Secretary Sean Spicer on the inauguration crowd size, Trump's bathrobe, and Melissa McCarthy than the Russia scandal. Trump associates are perhaps being questioned by House and Senate intelligence committee investigators, and the FBI, which according to news reports has looked at possible ties between Trump advisers and Russia, might also still be on the case. Yet this has not been a top priority for White House reporters.  Here are two questions that could have been posed to Spicer at his first briefing:  * Have any past or present Trump associates, inside or outside his administration, been contacted or questioned by the intelligence committees, the FBI, or any other government body investigating the Russian hacking or interactions between Trump's circle and Russia? * During the presidential campaign, did Trump or any of his political or business associates have any interactions with Russian officials or Russian intermediaries?  That did not happen. At Spicer's first briefing, Anita Kumar of McClatchy did ask, \"Has the president spoken to any of the intelligence agencies about the investigation into the Russian connections? And will he allow that to go on?\" Spicer replied, \"I don't believe he has spoken to anyone specifically about that and I don't know that. He has not made any indication that he would stop an investigation of any sort.\" This was an important question that warranted a response that was less equivocaland reporters could have pointed that out.  This quietude is good news for Putinand reason for him to think he could get away with such an operation again.  At the next day's briefing, on January 24, Margaret Talev of Bloomberg asked Spicer about reports that Comey was remaining in his post and whether Comey and Trump had discussed \"the Russia investigation and the parameters of that.\" Spicer responded, \"I don't have anything on that.\" Spicer's nonresponse didn't prompt any news.  In the fortnight since, the key twin questionswhat is Trump doing regarding the Russian hacking, and are Trump associates being investigated for interactions with Russia?have not been regular items on the agenda during the White House briefings. When Trump spoke to Putin by phone on January 28, subsequent media reports noted that the call focused on how relations could be improved. There was no public indication that Trump had said anything to Putin about the Russian intervention in the US election. And in the following days, White House reporters did not ask Spicer about this apparent omission.  There have been plenty of significant topics for journalists to press Spicer and the administration onthe travel ban on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Trump's plan to dump Obamacare, various nominations and a Supreme Court pick, Trump's fact-free charge of widespread voter fraud, Steve Bannon's participation on the National Security Council, Trump's contentious calls with foreign leaders, the president's erratic behavior, and much more. But the lack of media attention to the Russia story, at the White House briefings and beyond, is curious. It is true that the intelligence committee probes are being conducted secretly, and there are no public hearings or actions to cover. (Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, hoping to confine this scandal, succeeded in preventing the creation of a special committee or an independent commission to probe this affaireither of which would have probably sparked more coverage than the highly secretive intelligence committees.) Still, in the past, pundits, politicians, and reporters in Washington have not been reluctant to go all-out in covering and commenting upon a controversy subjected to private investigation.  In this instance, the president's own people may be under investigation, and Trump has demonstrated no interest in holding Putin accountable for messing with US elections in what may be considered an act of covert warfare. Still, there has been no loud demand from the DC media (or most of the GOP) for answers and explanations. This quietude is good news for Putinand reason for him to think he could get away with such an operation again.", "date": "2017/02/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/russia-trump-putin-scandal-media", "title": "The Mysterious Disappearance of the Biggest Scandal in Washington"}, {"text": "One of the most important men in Washington, DC, these days is Sen.

Since Trump has moved into the White House, there has been less public chatter in political and media quarters about the Russian hacking that, according to the US intelligence community, was mounted by Putin's spies as part of an extensive clandestine operation to undermine the US presidential campaign in order to benefit Trump. The same goes for allegations that Trump or his associates interacted with Russian officials or intermediaries during the campaign. After the election, Russia's deputy foreign minister said \"there were contacts\" between Trump's team and Russian officials, and various news reports have noted that the FBI has examined connections between Trump associates and Putin-allied Russianswithout offering much detail about these FBI inquiries. Yet in the first, chaos-filled weeks of the Trump presidency, the story of Russian meddling in the electionafter blowing up with the disclosure that President Barack Obama and Trump were briefed about private intelligence memos alleging Russia had run a yearslong secret program to cultivate Trump and gather compromising intelligence on himhas seemed to move off the center stage.  One cause of this seeming quietude is that after several weeks of political controversy regarding how best to investigate the matterwith Democrats joined by a small number of Republicans (that is, Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio) calling for a robust inquirythe Senate intelligence committee agreed to initiate its own probe. (The House intelligence community shortly followed suit.) After first being reluctant to include possible Trump-Russia ties in the investigation, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the Senate intelligence committee chair, relented. (Burr, no coincidence, was a member of the Trump campaign's national security advisory council.) But now that the intelligence committees are supposedly on the caseand with the FBI not discussing whatever inquiries it may be holding on this frontthe controversy (or scandal!) has been nudged to the back burner. This often happens in Washington: a secret investigation is launched, the story goes dark. (When Trump had a call with Putin after his first week in office, there was no indication from the White House that the new president had said anything to Putin about the Russian covert interference in the election. A senior Trump administration official told the Washington Post the chat had been \"pleasant.\")  Enter Wyden. For the public, at this point, there is no way to tell if the intelligence committee is doing a good job investigating these dicey issues. Republicans on the committee certainly have an interest in not embarrassing, inconveniencing, or delegitimizing Trump. So it's up to Wyden and the other Democrats on the committee to monitor the probe and inform the citizenry if it ends up being a whitewash. And Wyden has already indicated that there is information on Trump-Russia ties within the US government that ought to be declassified, that he will push to keep the committee's inquiry on track, and that he will press to make as much of its findings as public as possible. In early January, during a rare public hearing of the Senate intelligence committee, which focused on the intelligence community's recently released report concluding Putin's regime had mounted the hacking to help Trump, Wyden pressed FBI Director James Comey on whether he would declassify information the bureau had obtained related to possible Trump-Russia connections and \"release it to the American people\" before Trump was inaugurated. No, Comey said, adding, \"I can't talk about it.\" Wyden noted he was worried that if such information was not unveiled by then, it might never bemeaning, the incoming Trump administration would lock it up. And with this questioning, Wyden signaled that the FBI did indeed possess information on this subject.  Wyden failed to squeeze this material out of the FBI before Trump became president. But now he is in a position to tell the public if the Republican-led intelligence committee is doing an honest job with its all-important inquiry. A few days ago, I interviewed Wyden in his office and asked him about his role in this all-important project.  At the start of our conversation, Wyden, sitting at a long wooden conference table and wearing the usual senatorial dark suit (but with no tie), noted that he has a rule related to his intelligence committee duties: \"Break no oaths. Share no secrets. Ask tough questions.\" He pointed out that the \"tough questions\" part is a legacy from his father, Peter Wyden, who was a renowned investigative reporter and author in his day. Wyden cited from memory a passage from his dad's book on the CIA's disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs operation. In this portion, President John Kennedy, who authorized the paramilitary operation in his first weeks in office, asked an aide, \"How could I have been so stupid to let them go ahead?\" Wyden said he keeps this in mind to remember a key goal: oppose stupid policies.  \"People normally think things are classified and buttoned up for national reasons. I find it's far more likely to be political security than national security.\"  The 67-year-old senator, who has served in the upper chamber since 1996 (after 15 years in the House of Representatives), was reluctant to discuss specifics regarding the intelligence committee's probe. Why didn't the committee pursue an investigation sooner? After all, in early October, the Obama administration publicly announced the intelligence community had concluded Russia was behind the hacking. \"I'll let you ask Chairman Burr,\" he said. Were Democrats on the committee pushing for an investigation at that point? \"I can't get into that, the private discussions,\" he replied, adding that \"what was noteworthy\" was that the Obama administration by early October believed there was enough solid information to release that statement.  But was that a sufficiently strong response from Obama? Wyden paused for a momenthe often paused to carefully consider his repliesand then he said, \"Let's put it this way. There is a big gap between what the public had a right to know and what came out. And that continues to be true to this day.\"  He hadn't quite answered the question. I tried again: Was the Obama administration's responsethat statement and a remark from Press Secretary Josh Earnest promising some form of undefined retributionenough? \"No,\" Wyden said. \"It was not enough.\" Did Wyden or other Democrats on the intelligence committee request a more vigorous response from Obama? Wyden answered, \"I have to say, because these are all private conversations in classified settingsI don't think I can say.\"  But what did Wyden want Obama to do? There must be a nonclassified answer to that, I maintained. Once again, he paused: \"More_I think the way the public is brought in to these positions and the way materials are classified is totally out of whack. People normally think things are classified and buttoned up for national reasons. I find it's far more likely to be political security than national security.\" He added, \"There should have been more information released before the election.\"  It seemed clear that Wyden did not believe that Obama had replied sufficiently to the Russian hacking prior to the election.  Three weeks after the election, on November 29, Wyden organized Democratic members of the committee to send a letter to Obama requesting more information be made available to the public. It was only two sentences long: \"We believe there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election that should be declassified and released to the public. We are conveying specifics through classified channels.\" For reporters and others paying attention to this story, it was a frustrating letter, revealing no details regarding the information Wyden and his colleagues were trying to pry out of the FBI, CIA, or other agencies. And Wyden still cannot elaborate what was conveyed through those classified channels. But he said, this was the \"first time I know of that seven senators got together and called on materials to be declassified that way.\" He noted there was no immediate White House response. (In early January, the intelligence community, at Obama's instructions, did release a declassified version of its report noting it had concluded Putin's operation was designed to assist Trump.)  Wyden noted that after sending the November letter, he and other Democratic members of the committee \"kept pushing for information_recognizing that after January 20 it is a very different political climate for gathering information. What was needed was a much more detailed set of facts laid out, so that the public would have a better sense of what was actually taking place. And that can be done without compromising the nation's security.\"  \"Conservative Republicans are being asked by the Trump administration to suspend beliefs they have held in many instances for decades,\" Wyden said. \"For conservative Republicans, it's an article of faith to be skeptical of Russians, the KGB, and Putin.\"  The Senate intelligence committee has stated it will take three months to conduct its investigation. Might that be too short a time to do this investigation well? I asked Wyden. He didn't address this point. Instead, he said that what was most important is that the committee, as it has vowed to do, holds open hearings and releases its findings once the the gumshoe work is done. \"I am going to push as hard as I can to get the maximum transparency as quickly as possible,\" Wyden remarked. \"There is a question about whether the administration will cooperate.\" That's why, he noted, the committee will have to be prepared to use subpoenas.  Wyden did appear to worry that politics might get in the way of a fierce investigation. I asked if he has been surprised that congressional Republicanswith the exception of McCain, Graham, and Rubiohave largely ignored, downplayed, or dismissed the importance of the Russian hacking. \"Conservative Republicans are being asked by the Trump administration to suspend beliefs they have held in many instances for decades,\" he said. \"For conservative Republicans, it's an article of faith to be skeptical of Russians, the KGB, and Putin. Then all of a sudden you have the intelligence community coming in and saying they were hacking. That was in October. And you have a presidential candidate_practically encouraging it.\" But, he added, \"I'll let them speak for themselves.\" Are Republicans in an awkward position? \"That's an understatement,\" Wyden commented. Referring to Trump, he continued: \"How do you go from essentially saying the intelligence community are like Nazis to going out there and saying, 'I'm going to be the best friend you ever had.' Some of this is really head-scratching stuff.\"  Wyden has six fellow Democratic members of the intelligence committee, including Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the panel, to be part of the monitoring process. And Warner, Wyden, and others have said that if the committee's investigation doesn't meet their expectations, they will call for another inquiryperhaps an independent bipartisan commission. But Wyden noted that there is a possible wild card within the committee: McCain. He is not a full-time member, but as the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, he is an ex-officio member of the intelligence committee and has the right to know all its secrets. Consequently, he, too, can track the investigation and evaluate the amount of information the committee releases to the public. \"Don't underestimate the importance of having the chairman of the Senate armed services committee making it clear he's going to insist on answers and getting to the bottom of it,\" Wyden remarked.  Wyden will be aiming to do that, too. He has previously demonstrated he can be fierce in pressuring the secret-keepers. In a famous exchange, Wyden, during a March 2013 hearing, asked James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, whether US intelligence agencies collected data on Americans. Clapper answered, \"No, sir,\" and, \"Not wittingly.\" The Edward Snowden revelations soon showed that was a false statement. Clapper was forced to apologize to the committee. And for years, Wyden has been a vocal proponent of limiting government surveillance.  Now Wyden has a difficult task: to ensure that a highly sensitive intelligence committee investigation is done right and that the public learns as much as possible about the Russian operation to affect the US election and about possible ties between the president's inner circle and Russia. \"What's important,\" he said, \"is to get the facts out. Even if the politics have some consequences, there are a lot more damaging consequences to stonewall all this and push it aside.\" Perhaps. After all, it is quite possible that for some in Washington, stonewalling is actually the better option.", "date": "2017/02/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/ron-wyden-intelligence-committee-russia-trump-investigation", "title": "This Senator Is Hell-Bent on Getting Out the Truth About Trump and Russia"}, {"text": "This weekend, some prominent Democrats took to the barricades to protest President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigrants from certain Muslim-majority nations and limiting refugees. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rushed to Logan International Airport to join the spontaneous protest there. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey headed to Dulles International Airport outside Washington to decry the order as essentially a Muslim ban. Other Ds slammed Trump's move and praised the federal court order that temporarily froze part of the presidential order. It was a show of force. And it prompted a question: Was this a step toward a wider and deeper opposition to Trump?  Until now, the response from elected Democratic officials to the Trump takeover of the federal government has left some grassroots Dems underwhelmed and puzzled. The weekend of the inauguration, millions of Americans hit the streets to denounce Trump, his dystopic and divisive view of America, and his policies (especially those regarding women). The overarching message was fundamental: resist. Yet few national Democrats have mirrored back this sentiment to the progressive audience and to millions of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton and have spent the last few months in a state of discouragement, fear, and anger.  Sure, Capitol Hill Democrats have spoken against Trump and his fellow Republicans' first stab at repealing Obamacare and have called out the early GOP talk of privatizing Medicare. Booker did break with senatorial courtesy to testify against the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's choice to be attorney general. Yet at the same time, several key Democratsmost notably Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumertalked of working with Trump on areas of common ground, say infrastructure spending. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive firebrand, said he would be \"delighted\" to collaborate with Trump on trade policy. And most Senate Democrats have been voting for Trump's Cabinet nominees. Warren and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), another leading progressive, voted in the banking committee for Ben Carson, Trump's hardly qualified pick to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Booker and 46 other Democratic senators voted for retired General James Mattis, Trump's choice for defense secretary. (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has so far voted against every nominee except UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.)  The Senate Democrats have indicated they will mount campaigns against certain Trump nominees, notably Betsy DeVos, the education secretary nominee, and perhaps Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump's eager-to-repeal-Obamacare pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services. But their response so far has created the impression of piecemeal opposition. There has been no big thematic push against Trump. The concerns and outrage of the 66 million Americans who had voted for Clinton are not being directly addressed. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) did mobilize a modest-sized boycott of Trump's inauguration after saying Trump was not a \"legitimate\" president. But in general, the Democratic leadership was not sharing the sense that a crisis is underway.  And the first week of the Trump era did suggest that a crisis was at hand. Consider the following:  * In his initial days in the White House, Trump behaved in an erratic manner and gave reason to suspect he was prone to delusions. He repeatedly insisted that the crowd at his inauguration was record-setting. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he claimed that up to 1.5 million people were there and that his ceremony had topped the turnout at President Barack Obama's first inauguration. He pressed the National Park Service to back him up. He ordered White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to push this lie in public. During an event at the wall in CIA headquarters that commemorates agency officers who have lost their lives, Trump prattled on about the crowd size and claimed he had been on the cover of Time magazine more than football star Tom Brady or anyone else. (Wrong: Richard Nixon still holds that record.) The president of the United States was coming across as a fellow with a solid case of narcissistic personality disorder, as senior adviser Kellyanne Conway tried to explain that he and his crew were merely citing \"alternative facts.\" Days later, Trump bolstered the impression that he was untethered from reality when he claimedfirst in private to members of Congress and then publicly during an interviewthat 3 million to 5 million undocumented people had voted illegally in the presidential election. There was no evidence for this assertion. Still, Trump absurdly and stubbornly maintained that a study backed him up, though the author of this work had declared it did not confirm Trump's point. It turned out that Trump was probably basing his claim on a tweet from a guy with no expertise that had been promoted by Infowars, the conspiracy theory site of 9/11 truther Alex Jones. The fellow now in charge of the US nuclear arsenal was acting bizarrely.  * One of Trump's first actions was an executive order aimed at undermining the Affordable Care Act. He essentially instructed federal agencies to do what they can to weaken the program, while congressional Republicans vowed to make good on their obsession to smite Obamacare. The Rs faced the obvious problem of deriving a replacement that would preserve the most popular aspects of the programand it may be impossible for them to do so. (If you don't compel people, including young adults and the healthy, to buy insurance and enlarge the pool of insured, you cannot mandate insurers to cover preexisting conditions.) Still, the intent remained: Trump was aiming to blow up a program that provides 27 million or so Americans with health insurance. Ripping insurance from all these people posed a grave threat to a large percentage of the country.  * A promoter of white nationalists participating in the most sensitive and secretive meetings held in the White Housethat's essentially what Trump brought about when he signed an executive order that allowed Steve Bannon, a senior White House aide who is Trump's top political strategist, to sit in on the principals committee of the National Security Council. Bannon has acknowledged that as the publisher of Breitbart he positioned this conservative website as a \"platform\" for the alt-right, a wing of the conservative movement that prominently features white nationalists. Not only is Bannon a champion of white nationalists; he's a self-proclaimed proponent of political destruction. In November 2013, he declared in an interview, \"I'm a Leninist.\" And he explained, \"Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment.\" In a 2014 private talk he noted he believes the world is now experiencing a clash of civilizations: \"We're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.\" Placing a political adviser with extreme views in such important meetingsprevious presidents have kept their political aides out of these sessionsis a clear and present danger.  * Shortly before Trump took office, the US intelligence community issued a stark conclusion regarding Russia's meddling in the 2016 election: Vladimir Putin had ordered a comprehensive and covert Russian intelligence operation to subvert US democracy to assist Trump. Is there a more serious matter than the integrity of US elections? For months, Trump would not accept intelligence community assessments blaming Russia for the hacking of Democratic targets and the leaking of material to harm Clinton's campaign. He eventually and reluctantly acknowledged this conclusionbut he downplayed it, and he has not said what he intends to do in response. On Saturday, Trump had his first phone call with Putin, and the reports of the conversation suggested he did not confront Putin about Russia's interference in US elections. This was a serious abdication of presidential responsibility and a sign that he is not willing to defend the Constitution.  So during his first week in office, Trump triggered a constitutional crisis with his immigration order (as Customs and Border Protection agents refused to abide by a federal court's temporary stay) and adopted a policy that national security experts noted would impede the country's counterterrorism efforts, held a comfy conversation with a man who undermined US elections, started the process to deny millions of Americans health care, placed a fan of white nationalists in the middle of the most important national security discussions, and demonstrated that he literally cannot handle the truth. This is not business as usual. And Democrats and progressives beyond the Beltway are not wrong to wonder if the reaction from top Democrats has not been commensurate with Trump's actions.  It may be that the Democratic Party lacks leaders in a position to rally fundamental opposition to Trump. Schumer is an insider legislator. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is no rabble-rouser. There are no obvious 2020 candidates yet. Barack Obama and Joe Biden appeared to have taken a time-out. Yet the protests of the past two weekends show that there is an energized and mobilized anti-Trump movement, and most of its adherents are likely looking for Democrats to take a strong and robust stand against Trump. Perhaps the nationwide demonstrations against Trump will spur more Democratic opposition on Capitol Hill. After all, can Senate Democrats still vote for Sessions out of senatorial courtesy, when Trump has declared war on the values and programs they hold dear?  In the past days, Trump has sent a clear signal: He will disrupt, he will attack, he will not work cooperatively, he will not be burdened by facts or expertise. Democrats might have initially hoped to devise a strategy of selective opposition. But sometimes you cannot choose the fight you are in. Nuance is not always an option. In a Washington Post op-ed, Adam Jentleson, the former deputy chief of staff for Sen. Harry Reid, who just retired from the Senate, counseled Democrats to forge a wide-ranging front against Trump. He noted how this could be done: \"Senate Democrats have a powerful tool at their disposal, if they choose to use it, for resisting a president who has no mandate and cannot claim to embody the popular will. That tool lies in the simple but fitting act of withholding consent. An organized effort to do so on the Senate floor can bring the body to its knees and block or severely slow down the agenda of a president who does not represent the majority of Americans.\"  Schumer has not yet embraced such a strategy of resistance. But Senate Dems said on Monday that they will wage a filibuster to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee. And Schumer announced that he would oppose five Trump nominations: Price, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) for budget director, Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary, Scott Pruitt for Environmental Protection Agency chief, and Andy Puzder for labor secretary. Meanwhile, Obama released a mildly worded statement praising this weekend's demonstrations and criticizing policies that \"discriminate against individuals because of their faith or religion.\"  Millions of Americans do not share Trump's dark ideas and do not accept his bigotry and misogyny. They represent a majority of the electorate, and they are ready and eager to confront Trumpism. If the Democratic Party is serious about reversing its fortunes, it must harness this energy. That means presenting an opposition that resonates with these voters. At the start of Week Two of the Trump Era, there were indications the Democrats were moving toward a more comprehensive opposition, perhaps wielding the tools of obstructionism that Republicans used to thwart President Barack Obama's agenda. With Trump already on the rampage, they may not have much choice.", "date": "2017/01/30", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-democratic-opposition-executive-order-immigration", "title": "Is It Time for the Democrats to Wage All-Out War Against Trump?"}, {"text": "The night before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, the New York Times dropped a bombshell: intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been examining intercepted communications and financial transactions in an investigation of possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials. This report seemed to confirm previous indications that the US government has collected sensitive intelligence about interactions between Trump insiders and Russians. And hours before the inauguration, I ran into Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been one of the few Republicans to call for a special investigation of the Russian hacking that helped Trump, and I asked him about this latest development.  Graham, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, said that he didn't know anything about the intelligence intercepts. He remarked, \"I want to learn and investigate all things Russian, wherever it leads.\" He noted that it was clear that Vladimir Putin's regime had \"tried to undermine our election\" and \"succeeded in creating discontent and discord.\" He added, \"I want to know what they did and who they did it with.\" He went on: \"I want to see all of it...I want to know what Russia did...If there is campaign contacts, I want to know about it.\"  Graham said he hoped to examine what the FBI knew about any Trump-Russia contacts and what actions the bureau had taken. (Before the election, FBI Director Jim Comey talked rather publicly about the bureau's investigation of Hillary Clinton's handling of her email at the State Department. But Comey has declined to say anything in public regarding whether the bureau has probed links between Trump associates and Russians.) \"I hope to be able to work with Sen. Grassley [the chair of the judiciary committee] to look into the FBI's role,\" Graham said, \"in terms of what they did, what they know, and what they can provide to Congress.\"  At the moment, the Senate investigation of the Russian hacking and possible contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign is being conducted by the Senate intelligence committee. So it's unclear whether Graham will get his wish for a judiciary committee inquiry into the FBI end of this matter.  Before darting off to inauguration business, Graham, who often tussled with Trump during the 2016 campaign, criticized the incoming president for trying to downplay Russian meddling in the 2016 election. \"Trump,\" he said, \"seems to be in the forgive-and-forget mode.\" He noted the \"biggest mistake\" Trump could make would be \"forgiving Russia...for what they did in our election.\"", "date": "2017/01/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/lindsey-graham-calls-investigating-what-fbi-did-about-russia-trump-intelligence", "title": "GOP Senator Calls for Investigating What FBI Did About Russia-Trump Intelligence"}, {"text": "Today, as of noon, the president of the United States is a man who boasted of sexually assaulting women. The nations leader is a purveyor of fake news and conspiracy theories who led the racist birther campaign. The commander in chief in charge of the US nuclear arsenal is a fellow who was unfamiliar with the nuclear triad but who is obsessed with revenge. The head of the federal government is a businessman who vowed to \"drain the swamp\" but who has taken office loaded with troubling conflicts of interest and flouting multiple ethics norms. The defender of the Constitution is a record-setting prevaricator and fabulist who has repeatedly attacked journalists who challenge his false assertions. The guy who oversees national law enforcement is a dishonest developer who was sued for racially based housing discrimination and who lied about his mob ties. The person in charge of US national security is a foreign policy novice who has called for enhancing relations with a foreign power that covertly worked to subvert American democracy in order to benefit him and whose associates are under investigation by agencies he now oversees for possible contacts with that foreign power. The most powerful man in the world is a thin-skinned, arrogant, name-calling, bullying, narcissistic hotelier.  Thank you, America. Or, that is, the 46 percent of the electorate who voted for Donald Trump.  Their view of the nation and its current condition was diametrically opposed to the perspective of the majority, who voted for Hillary Clinton. Trump voters bought his spiel and his shtick. He portrayed the United States as a declining hellhole, a dystopia under siege by undocumented Latino immigrants, criminals, and ISIS, with Middle America workers played for rubes by uncaring, screw-you political, corporate, and media elites in league with international bankers. And Trump was the tough-guy white knight who would do whatever it tookdisruption! chaos!to restore the lives and dreams of hardworking folks and bring about the return of some mythical (whiter?) American greatness. (Details to come.)  And when he gave his first speech as presidenthis inaugural address on a dismal and gray dayTrump, no surprise, stuck with the simple and bumperstickerish themes that had brought him to this once improbable point: There is \"carnage\" across the land, the American people have been betrayed by a small group of elites, and it's time for America First. Speaking to a sea of white peoplewho were being protected by a police force that is mostly blackTrump peddled the same big and bold promises he slung during the campaign: \"America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\" The crowd cheered wildly for the nation's No. 1 salesman. And they hooted when Clinton appeared on the big screen, and many in the VIP section toward the front of the crowd jeered when Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the speakers before Trump, referred to gender identity equality.  Trump turned hate into a political tool. He's not the first. But he effectively fueled and exploited long-established conservative hatred of Latinos, Obama, Clinton, the media, Muslims. He mocked a disabled reporter. He derided a federal judge who had ruled against him in the Trump University fraud suit as a \"Mexican.\" He described black communities as nothing but crime-infested and burned-out ghettoes. He encouraged voters to detest Washington and government. He made common cause with conspiracy nut Alex Jones. He won the support of the Ku Klux Klan and the alt-right (the fancy name for white nationalists). He encouraged violence at his rallies. He denounced his opponent as a treasonous criminal and called for her to be locked up. He obnoxiously insulted and openly feuded with, well_just about everyone: Miss Universe, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Carly Fiorina, Rosie. Spite was his meme.  Worse, Trump hitched hate to fear. He claimed that the nation was gripped by a crime spree (which didn't exist), that ISIS was on the verge of invading the United States (not really), and that hundreds of millions of undocumented immigrants were poised to \"pour\" across the border (nope).  Most people who behave in such caddish and uncivil ways are dismissed as jerksnot embraced as the embodiment of the nation and its hopes and aspirations. In modern times, no candidate who campaigned so angrily has ever won the presidency. But early in the race, Trump's team concluded that Trump was already widely known for his crass and abrasive public persona. (This was well before he was caught on video boasting about grabbing women \"by the pussy.\") What was most important, one of his strategists told me this summer, was whether voters accepted Trump's pitch that the country was in free fall (terrorism! no jobs! immigrants invading!) and were sufficiently freaked out to embrace a political novice who would promise extreme measures to deal with all this crap. Were the voters pissed off enough to accept a TV star businessman (forget the bankruptcies or mob tieslook at that jet) who didn't give a damn about niceties and who would screw anyone who disagreed with him or got in his way? His only chance, his strategists knew, was if enough Americans wanted an asshole as president. As it turned out, a majority did not, but 63 million didand that was enough for Trump to bag a win in the Electoral College.  After the election, Trump continued to act and tweet like Trump. As if the act had to continue. With inane tweets, he repeatedly dumped on Alec Baldwin and civil rights icon John Lewis. He referred to Americans who voted against him as the enemy. He compared the intelligence communitywhich concluded Vladimir Putin had meddled in the US elections to boost Trumpto Nazis and continued to make nice with Putin and to demonize Clinton. Having won the grand prize, Trump showed not a smidgeon of graciousness. He fibbed about matters large and small. (He claimed all the ball gowns were sold out in Washington because so many people would be celebrating his inauguration. High-end clothing outlets told reporters they had plenty of inventory.)  Trump demonstrated that his campaign trail populism was no more than an artifice. He appointed billionaires and Goldman Sachs vets to the Cabinet and did little to clean up the swamp he had denounced. His plan to deal with his own conflicts of interest was a sham. (He begins his presidency in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause.) Trump empowered Republicans aiming to privatize Medicare and eviscerate Social Securitynotions Trump opposed during the race. He vowed that his Obamacare replacement would entail \"insurance for everybody\"; then he backtracked. He demonstrated no core ideological convictions. He showed once again that he is 100 percent situational.  His approval rating plummeted to a record low for a president-elect. Yet congressional Republicans stood by him and waved a rubber stamp for his appointees. And it was unclear whether any of his missteps tainted him in the eyes of his die-hard supporters. At the inauguration, his supporters gasped with excitement when he gave the crowd a thumbs-up. Well-heeled folks in the big-donor section applauded his denouncement of the establishment and his vow to give government back to the people. Many went gaga when Melania Trump appeared on the television screens, wearing a fashionable blue coat.  During the campaign, one Trump aide told me that the Trump camp understood that many of his supporters were low-information voters. \"They mainly just see the headlines,\" he said. So if a headline said, \"Trump Vows to Make America Great Again,\" that was the message many of these people absorbed. By speaking in slogans and memes\"Lock her up!\"Trump was effectively communicating and connecting with a large group of voters. The specifics didn't registeror matter.  This has continued during the transition period, with Trump issuing bold promises and boasting that his efforts have already saved American jobs. (The details, often more complicated, don't reach many of his voters.) He did the same with his short inaugural address, which was light on compound sentences or sophisticated ideas. Consequently, there is no telling if his folks will sour on him, if he keeps insisting that he is doing one helluva job.  Trump now shifts from campaigning to governing. It's unlikely he will change his tactics. He will continue to praise himself and his efforts and declare every step he takes a gargantuan win for America. He will continue to blame others, if anything falls short or goes wrong. He will keep on picking Twitter feuds and behaving in a juvenile and puerile mannerperhaps as a strategic distraction or perhaps because he simply cannot help himself. He certainly is not embarrassed by his behaviorand a man who cannot be embarrassed is a dangerous man.  So for the American majority who voted against Trump and his keep-it-simple politics of fear, hate, and insult, the nation begins the Trump era with no silver linings.

The real trouble is with the 63 million who voted for him. How long will they stand by him and buy his easy-answers, reality-defying pitch?

And a veiled but public exchange between Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the committee, and FBI Director James Comey during a hearing on January 10 suggested the FBI has collected information on possible ties between Trump associates and Russians and may still be probing this matter. So with subpoena-wielding investigators on this beat, here's a suggestion: The gumshoes ought to talk to an American from Belarus named Sergei Millian, who has boasted of close ties to Trump and who has worked with an outfit the FBI suspected of being a Russian intelligence front. If they haven't already.  Millian, who is in his late 30s and won't say when he came to the United States or how he obtained US citizenship, is an intriguing and mysterious figure with a curious connection to Trump. He is president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in the USA (RACC) and the owner of a translation service. The RACC, a nonprofit that Millian started in Atlanta in 2006 and that has survived on shoestring budgets, advocates closer commercial ties between Russia and the United States and assists US firms looking to do business in Russia. In 2009, the group called for the US Congress \"to foster necessary political changes to produce a healthier economic environment\" and grant permanent normal trade relations status to Russia. Its website notes that it \"facilitates cooperation for U.S. members with the Russian Government, Russian Regional Administrations, U.S. Consulates in Russia, Chambers of Commerce in Russia, and corporate leaders from CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] countries.\"  The Russian-American Chamber of Commerce's 2011 tax return reported the group was based in an apartment in Astoria, Queens, where Millian livedthough the group's letterhead that year listed a Wall Street addressand that year it brought in only $23,300 in contributions and grants and $14,748 in program revenue. The tax return noted that the chamber \"successfully hosted four universities from Russia in New York City\" and hosted a trade mission from Belarus. In 2015, Millian received a Russian award for fostering cooperation between US and Russian businesses.  On his LinkedIn page, Millian notes he is also the vice president of an outfit called the World Chinese Merchants Union Association, a group that has only a slight presence on the internet and that seems to have an address in Beijing. According to a LinkedIn post published by Millian in April 2016, he met that month in Beijing with a Chinese official and the Russian ambassador to the Republic of San Marino to discuss industrial and commercial cooperation between China and Russia.  Millian's online bio notes he graduated from the Minsk State Linguistic University with the equivalent of a master's degree in 2000. His bio says he is a real estate broker who works in residential and commercial properties in the United States and abroad. He used to go by the name Siarhei Kukutsthat's how he's listed on tax returns for the RACCand it is unclear why he changed his name. Millian also has repeatedly claimed he had a significant business association with Trump.  In an April 2016 interview with RIA Novosti, a Russian media outlet, Millian described his history with Trump. He said he met the celebrity real estate developer in 2007 when Trump visited Moscow for a \"Millionaire's Fair,\" where he was promoting Trump Vodka. Millian noted that Trump subsequently invited him to a horse race in Miami. \"Later,\" Millian said, \"we met at his office in New York, where he introduced me to his right-hand manMichael Cohen. He is Trump's main lawyer, all contracts go through him. Subsequently, a contract was signed with me to promote one of their real estate projects in Russia and the CIS. You can say I was their exclusive broker.\"  Millian said he had helped Trump \"study the Moscow market\" for potential real estate investments. In the April 2009 issue of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce newsletter, Millian reported that he was working with Russian investors looking to buy property in the United States, and he said, \"We have signed formal agreements with the Richard Bowers and Co., the Trump Organization and The Related Group to jointly service the Russian clients' commercial, residential and industrial real estate needs.\" Millian's claim did jibe with what Donald Trump Jr. said at a 2008 real estate conference in New York. Trump's son noted, \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" He added, \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"  In the 2016 interview, Millian asserted that Trump would be good for Russia if elected president. Trump, he noted, would improve US relations with Russia and lift economic sanctions imposed by Washington on Russia. He said Trump was interested in doing business in Russia: \"I don't want to reveal [Trump's] position, but he is keeping Moscow in his sights and is waiting for an appropriate time.\" Millian added, \"In general Trump has a very positive attitude to Russians, because he sees them as clients for his business. Incidentally, he has done many projects with people from the Russian-language diaspora. For example, Trump SoHo in New York with billionaire Tamir Sapir.\" (Sapir, who died in 2014, was an American billionaire real estate developer from the former Soviet republic of Georgia.)  Millian apparently was proud of his association with Trump. In 2014, he posted on Facebook a photograph of him with Trump and Jorge Perez, the billionaire real estate developer in Miami who owns the Related Group.  Millian seemed delighted to spin for Trump and push the impression he was a Trump insider. During the Republican convention, he told the Daily Beast that Trump was a \"powerful, charismatic, and highly intelligent leader with a realistic approach toward Russia.\" He added, \"I, personally, wholeheartedly support his presidential aspirations. It's been a great pleasure representing Mr. Trump's projects in Russia.\" But weeks later, as the Russia hacking controversy was heating up, Millian, in another exchange with the Daily Beast, downplayed his connection to Trump. And the website reported that after its reporter spoke him, Millian removed mentions of his Trump association from an online biography. It also appears that references to the Trump Organization working with the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in the USA were at some point scraped from its website.  Millian's activities and ties to Trump have raised questions. In October, the Financial Times mounted an investigation of him and the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. It reported:  Most of the board members are obscure entities and nearly half of their telephone numbers went unanswered when called by the Financial Times. An FT reporter found no trace of the Chamber of Commerce at the Wall Street address listed on its website. At the same time, the chamber appears to have close official ties, arranging trips for visiting Russian regional governors to the US.  As part of its inquiry into Millian, the newspaper pointed to Millian's connection to Rossotrudnichestvo, a Russian government organization that promotes Russian culture abroad. In 2013, Mother Jones reported that Rossotrudnichestvo was under investigation by the FBI for using junkets to recruit American assets for Russian intelligence. Through cultural exchanges, Rossotrudnichestvo, which operates under the jurisdiction of the Russian Foreign Ministry, was bringing young Americansincluding political aides, nonprofit advocates, and business executiveson trips to Russia. The program was run by Yury Zaytsev, a Russian diplomat who headed the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, DC.  Americans who participated in the exchange trips and were later questioned by FBI agents told Mother Jones that the agents' questions indicated the FBI suspected Zaytsev and Rossotrudnichestvo had been using the all-expenses-paid trips to Russia to cultivate Americans as intelligence assets. (An asset could be a person who directly works with an intelligence service to gather information, or merely a contact who provides information, opinions, or gossip, not realizing it is being collected by an intelligence officer.) After Mother Jones published a story on the FBI investigation, the Russian embassy in Washington issued a statement: \"All such 'scaring information' very much resembles Cold War era. A blunt tentative is made to distort and to blacken activities of the Russian Cultural Center in DC, which are aimed at developing mutual trust and cooperation between our peoples and countries.\" (A year later, in November 2014, Zaytsev spoke at a Moscow press conference and said, in reference to the upcoming US presidential elections, \"It seems to me that the Russian 'card' will certainly be played out.\" He added, \"I think that this presidential election first of all will very clearly show a trend of further development\" in US-Russia relations.)  Millian has collaborated with Rossotrudnichestvo. In 2011, he and the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce worked with Zaytsev and the Russian group to mount a 10-day exchange that brought 50 entrepreneurs to the first \"Russian-American Business Forum\" in Moscow and the Vladimir region, according to a letter Millian sent to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev after the initiative. In that letter, Millian praised Rossotrudnichestvo, and he added, \"My entire staff, fellow participants, and I, here at the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in the USA, very much look forward to assisting Rossotrudnichestvo with the preparations for next year's trip.\" (Millian now says, \"We are not affiliated with [Rossotrudnichestvo] in any way.\")  Toward the end of the presidential campaign Michael Cohen, the Trump lawyer, told the Financial Times that Millian's claims of working with Trump were \"nothing more than a weak attempt to align himself with Mr. Trump's overwhelmingly successful brand.\" But the newspaper reported that Cohen \"did not respond to questions about whether he interacted with Mr. Millian or why Mr. Millian is one of only 100 people he follows on Twitter.\" (Cohen no longer follows Millian on Twitter.) Hope Hicks, Trump's campaign spokeswoman, told the paper that Trump had \"met and spoke\" with Millian only \"on one occasion almost a decade ago at a hotel opening.\"  Cohen, Hicks, Sean Spicer, Trump's designated White House press secretary, and the Trump presidential transition team did not respond to a request for information regarding Millian's interactions with Trump and his associates.  Reached by telephone this week, Millian said he would not discuss his relationship with Trump and requested he be sent questions via email. Mother Jones subsequently sent him a list. Millian responded in an email with answers to a different set of questions, and he noted he would not answer any queries about his personal background or provide any details beyond what was in this reply. He said in the email, \"I have a solid reputation with businesses around the world. It's a common practice for immigrants to change name upon immigrating to the USA. I am US citizen and do not have and never had Russian citizenship. I live and work in NYC.\"  In the email, Millian asserted, \"I have never said that I worked personally for Trump. I said I was a broker for one of his many real estate projects. There are several brokers who work on such real estate projects. I never represented Mr Trump personally and I am not working with Mr Trump.\" He added, \"I have signed an official contract with talks of exclusivity that authorized me to represent Trump name project in Russia and CIS.\" But he said he had never been paid by Trump for any work. He maintained that the last time he spoke to Trump was in 2008.  Millian insisted he had \"never worked for Russian Government or Russian military as a translator or in any other capacity.\" He said, \"We never got any business with Rossotrudnichestvo.\" And he made this point: \"I'm a member of the Presidential Trust of NRC-GOP and supporter of Mr Trump who contributed to his campaign just the same way as many millions of Americans. I'm proud that Mr Trump became our president. I'm sure he will rebuild our great nation to the highest standards just as he did with his distinguished buildings. We desperately need better infrastructure, airports, railways in this country. Also, high time starting paying off national debts. I feel upset that press tries to distracts him from making our country great again by distributing fake news.\" (A search of campaign finance records revealed no contribution from Millian to the Trump campaign or the Republican National Committee; a contribution of $200 does not have to be itemized.)  Millian's response ignored several questions Mother Jones sent him. He would not say when he left Belarus or explain how he became an American citizen. He would not discuss the details of the deal he previously claimed to have struck with the Trump Organization. He would not say how many times he worked on projects or exchanges with Rossotrudnichestvo. (His response seemed to suggest he had nothing to do with the Russian organization, yet the 2011 letter he wrote indicated his Russian-American Chamber of Commerce had collaborated with Rossotrudnichestvo.) He did not explain why references to the Trump organization had been scraped from the RACC's website and his bio. And he did not answer this question: \"In the last year and a half, have you had any contacts with Donald Trump or any of his political or business associates?\"  Various media outlets that have examined links between Trump and Russia have focused on Carter Page, a Moscow-connected foreign policy adviser for Trump 's presidential campaign (whom Trump spokesman Sean Spicer recently falsely claimed Trump did not know) and Paul Manafort, Trump's onetime presidential campaign manager who had business ties to Russians and Putin-allied Ukrainians. Any official investigators would likely be interested in these two men. They also should schedule a sit down with Millian.", "date": "2017/01/19", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-russia-sergei-millian", "title": "Investigators on the Trump-Russia Beat Should Talk to This Man"}, {"text": "Last fall, a week before the election, I broke the story that a former Western counterintelligence official had sent memos to the FBI with troubling allegations related to Donald Trump. The memos noted that this spy's sources had provided him with information indicating that Russian intelligence had mounted a yearslong operation to co-opt or cultivate Trump and had gathered secret compromising material on Trump. They also alleged that Trump and his inner circle had accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin. These memos caused a media and political firestorm this week when CNN reported that President Barack Obama and Trump had been told about their existence, as part of briefings on the intelligence community's assessment that Russia hacked political targets during the 2016 campaign to help Trump become president. For my story in October, I spoke with the former spy who wrote these memos, under the condition that I not name him or reveal his nationality or the spy service where he had worked for nearly two decades, mostly on Russian matters.  \"Someone like me stays in the shadows,\" the former spy said.  The former spy told me that he had been retained in early June by a private research firm in the United States to look into Trump's activity in Europe and Russia. \"It started off as a fairly general inquiry,\" he recalled. One question for him, he said, was, \"Are there business ties in Russia?\" The American firm was conducting a Trump opposition research project that was first financed by a Republican source until the funding switched to a Democratic one. The former spy said he was never told the identity of the client.  The former intelligence official went to work and contacted his network of sources in Russia and elsewhere. He soon received what he called \"hair-raising\" information. His sources told him, he said, that Trump had been \"sexually compromised\" by Russian intelligence in 2013 (when Trump was in Moscow for the Miss Universe contest) or earlier and that there was an \"established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.\" He noted he was \"shocked\" by these allegations. By the end of June, he was sending reports of what he was finding to the American firm.  The former spy said he soon decided the information he was receiving was \"sufficiently serious\" for him to forward it to contacts he had at the FBI. He did this, he said, without permission from the American firm that had hired him. \"This was an extraordinary situation,\" he remarked.  The response to the information from the FBI, he recalled, was \"shock and horror.\" After a few weeks, the bureau asked him for information on his sources and their reliability and on how he had obtained his reports. He was also asked to continue to send copies of his subsequent reports to the bureau. These reports were not written, he noted, as finished work products; they were updates on what he was learning from his various sources. But he said, \"My track record as a professional is second to no one.\"  The former spy told me that he was reluctant to be talking with a reporter. He pointed out this was not his common practice. \"Someone like me stays in the shadows,\" he said. But he indicated that he believed this material was important, and he was unsure how the FBI was handling it. Certainly, there had been no public signs that the FBI was investigating these allegations. (The FBI at the time refused to tell me if it had received the memos or if it was examining the allegations.)  \"This was something of huge significance, way above party politics,\" the former spy told me. \"I think [Trump's] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.\" He noted that he believed Russian intelligence's efforts aimed at Trump were part of Vladimir Putin's campaign to \"disrupt and divide and discredit the system in Western democracies.\"  After speaking with the former counterintelligence official, I was able to confirm his identity and expertise. A senior US administration official told me that he had worked with the onetime spook and that the former spy had an established and respected track record of providing US government agencies with accurate and valuable information about sensitive national security matters. \"He is a credible source who has provided information to the US government for a long time, which senior officials have found to be highly credible,\" this US official said.  I also was able to review the memos the former spy had written, and I quoted a few key portions in my article. I did not report the specific allegationsespecially the lurid allegations about Trump's personal behaviorbecause they could not be confirmed. The newsworthy story at this point was that a credible intelligence official had provided information to the FBI alleging Moscow had tried to cultivate and compromise a presidential candidate. And the issue at handat a time when the FBI was publicly disclosing information about its investigation of Hillary Clinton's handling of her email at the State Departmentwas whether the FBI had thoroughly investigated these allegations related to Russia and Trump. I also didn't post the memos, as BuzzFeed did this week, because the documents contained information about the former spy's sources that could place these people at risk.  When I spoke with the former spy, he appeared confident about his materialacknowledging these memos were works in progressand genuinely concerned about the implications of the allegations. He came across as a serious and somber professional who was not eager to talk to a journalist or cause a public splash. He realized he was taking a risk, but he seemed duty bound to share information he deemed crucial. He noted that these allegations deserved a \"substantial inquiry\" within the FBI. Yet so far, the FBI has not yet said whether such an investigation has been conducted. As the former spy said to me, \"The story has to come out.\"", "date": "2017/01/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/spy-who-wrote-trump-russia-memos-it-was-hair-raising-stuff", "title": "The Spy Who Wrote the Trump-Russia Memos: It Was \"Hair-Raising\" Stuff"}, {"text": "The man picked by Donald Trump to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency apparently is in the dark on an important intelligence matter: Trump's view on torture.  Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) has been tapped by Trump to lead the spy service, and on Thursday morning he came before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing. He addressed the matters in the headlines. He said he accepted the intelligence community's assessment that Russian intelligence hacked Democratic targets during the 2016 campaign and then leaked material to benefit Trump. \"It is pretty clear,\" Pompeo said, noting the Russian motive was \"to have an impact on American democracy.\" Unlike Trump, Pompeo was fully embracing the intelligence community's findings.  But Pompeo was also caught in a hack-related contradiction. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the committee, pointed to a tweet Pompeo sent out in July declaring, \"Need further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by Wikileaks.\" King didn't say this, but his point was obvious: With this tweet, the incoming CIA chief had helped a secret Russian intelligence operation to change the outcome of the presidential election. King did ask Pompeo, \"Do you think WikiLeaks is a reliable source of information?\" Pompeo replied, \"I do not.\" So, King inquired, why did he post this tweet and cite WikiLeaks as \"proof\"? Pompeo was busted. Pompeo repeated that he had never considered WikiLeaks a \"credible source.\" King pushed on and asked Pompeo how he could explain his tweet. Pompeo stammered and remarked, \"I'd have to go back and take a look at that.\" Uh, right.  Another awkward moment came when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) questioned Pompeo about the use of torture. \"If you were ordered by the president,\" she asked, \"to restart the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques that fall outside the Army field manual\"meaning waterboarding and other methods now banned by law\"would you comply?\"  \"Absolutely not,\" Pompeo said. He pointed out that he had voted for the law that banned waterboarding and other acts of torture that the CIA had used during the Bush-Cheney years. \"I will always comply with the law,\" Pompeo declared. (In 2014, however, he claimed that the interrogation techniques in use during the Bush administration were not torture.)  But Pompeo also said this: \"I can't imagine I would be asked by the president-elect or then president\" to have the CIA engage in torture.  His imagination, then, is rather limited. During the presidential contest, Trump made headlines with his promise to revive waterboarding and to use other means of torture. During one of the Republican primary debates, Trump was quite firm on this point. He was asked about former CIA Director Michael Hayden's remark that the military could defy orders from the president to torture or kill civilians, and Trump went on a roll:  They won't refuse. They're not going to refuse, believe me. You look at the Middle East, they're chopping off heads, they're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way, they're drowning people in steel cages, and now we're talking about waterboarding_It's fine, and if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger too. Because frankly, that's the way I feel. Can you imagine these people, these animals, over in the Middle East that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.  Trump was indicating that he didn't give a damn about laws restricting the use of torture and that he would expect officials to follow any presidential orders to engage in such conduct. So how hard is it to envision that Trump, once in office, might order intelligence services and the military to use waterboarding and acts of torture that are \"tougher than waterboarding\"?  Pompeo was clear that his view on the use of torture is not in sync with Trump's. He was clear that he would not follow an order to employ such methods. But he indicated that he didn't understand his soon-to-be boss' attitude toward torture. After all, it doesn't take that much creativity to imagine Trump trying to follow through on his vow to bring back waterboading and much worse.", "date": "2017/01/12", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-waterboarding-torture-cia", "title": "Trump's CIA Pick Doesn't Seem to Understand the President-Elect's View on Torture"}, {"text": "Donald Trump has hit send on a lot of ill-advised tweetstweets that were false, tweets that showed him to be thin-skinned or a bully. But perhaps no tweet ranks as, well, dumb as the one he sent out Wednesday morning, just hours before his first press conference in six months. He was reacting to news stories noting that when the intelligence community provided President Barack Obama and Trump its assessment that Russia hacked the 2016 campaign in order to help Trump, the spies also provided Obama and Trump a two-page addendum noting that a foreign counterintelligence veteran had provided the US government with memos claiming Russian intelligence had mounted a yearslong operation to co-opt or cultivate Trump and had gathered compromising information on Trump. This is how Trump responded:  Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \"A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\" Very unfair!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017  Trump was apparently referring to a Vladimir Putin spokesman dismissing these reports as \"pulp fiction\" and an \"attempt to harm our bilateral relationship.\"  So here was the incoming president of the United States embracing a Kremlin statement as the go-to truth. Russia, by the way, has also denied hacking Democratic targets to influence the presidential election, and Trump still has not fully acknowledged the US intelligence conclusion that Moscow meddled in the campaign to assist Trump.  Trump's tweet demonstrated a profound naivet. If the memos are accurate and Putin's regime did collaborate with Trump's camp and did try to win him over (let alone coerce him to be supportive of Putin and Russian interests), would the Kremlin ever admit doing so? This is Le Carr stuff. Spy versus spy. Homeland. Note to Trump: It is a secret! One need not be an intelligence expert to realize that a foreign power that mounted a clandestine operation to influence a prominent businessman, a presidential candidate, or a president would not publicly admit to doing so.  It is stunning that Trump would point to this Kremlin remark as an accurate statement that deserves credence. There are plenty of other ways he could have responded to these inconvenient and troubling news reports. His inability to recognize Moscow spin as irrelevant and not credible is worrisome. It is absurd for a president-to-be to promote Putin's talking points as truth, and the fact the man who will soon be in charge of US national security doesn't understand this is frightening.", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/allegations-russia-intelligence-cultivated-trump-lead-his-dumbest-tweet-ever", "title": "Russia Allegations Lead to Donald Trump's Dumbest Tweet Ever"}, {"text": "It was only a couple of questions in the middle of a hearing, but the queries posed to FBI Director James Comey by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) during a Senate Intelligence Committee gathering on Tuesday afternoon had potentially explosive implications, because they suggested that Wyden believes the FBI has been sitting on information regarding ties between Donald Trump's inner circle and Russia.  The hearing was focused on the intelligence community's recently released report concluding that Vladimir Putin's regime had mounted an extensive secret operation to influence the US election in order to help Trump. At the start of the hearing, outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized that the report did not assess whether the Russian meddling had affected the outcome of the election. This was an indirect rebuke to Trump and his partisans, who have repeatedly said the report concluded the Russian intervention did not affect the results. Comey also noted that Russian hackers had targeted Republican targets but that the FBI had not found evidence that Moscow had penetrated the Trump campaign or current accounts of the Republican National Committee.  The most dramatic exchange came with Wyden's questions. He noted that several media outlets have reported that Trump campaign associates, including Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, had maintained connections with Russians tied to Putin. He asked Comey, \"Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships?\" Comey answered, \"I would never comment on investigations...in an open forum.\"  Wyden pushed Comey further. He asked whether the FBI chief would declassify information related to this matter and \"release it to the American people\" by January 20. No, Comey said, adding, \"I can't talk about it.\"  Wyden then declared, \"The American people have a right to know this.\" He continued: \"If it doesn't happen by January 20, I'm not sure it's going to happen.\"  Wyden's line of questioning indicated that he believes (or knows) the FBI has collected information on Trump ties to Moscow. And Wyden is in a position to know. As a member of the committee, he can see classified material gathered by the FBI and other national security agencies. With these questions to Comey, Wyden was seemingly referring to specific information. In fact, on November 30, he led all the Democratic members in sending a short letter to President Barack Obama that stated, \"We believe there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election that should be declassified and released to the public. We are conveying specifics through classified channels.\" The letter gave no hint of the nature of this information.  But it is not hard to read between the lines: Intelligence committee members have received classified briefings that included information regarding contacts between the Trump camp and Russians.  In September, Yahoo News reported that US intelligence agencies were probing the contacts between Russian officials and Carter Page, who was identified by the Trump campaign as one of its foreign policy advisers. The New York Times reported in November that the FBI was looking at Manafort's business ties to Ukrainians who were Putin allies. The newspaper noted, \"In classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump.\"  Wyden also apparently fears that once Trump takes over the executive branch, this informationand perhaps any ongoing investigationswould be suppressed.  Shortly after Wyden questioned Comey, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) asked the FBI director if he would say whether any investigations on Trump and Russia were underway. \"We never confirm or deny a pending investigation,\" Comey replied. King shot back: \"The irony of you making that statement I cannot avoid.\" This was a clear reference to Comey's public declarations during the presidential campaign about the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's handling of email at the State Department. Comey responded, \"We sometimes think differently about closed investigations.\"  So what specifically prompted Wyden to press Comey at the hearing? The American public may never know.", "date": "2017/01/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/fbi-information-investigation-trump-russia-wyden", "title": "Is the FBI Sitting on Information About Ties Between Trump and Russia?"}, {"text": "During his confirmation hearing on Tuesday morning, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, engaged in a curious exchange with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate judiciary committee. Graham asked Sessions a simple question about Russian hacking during the 2016 campaign, and Sessions...well, basically said nothing. As attorney general, he will oversee the FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and the FBI, along with other national security agencies, has concluded that Russian intelligence mounted an extensive covert operation to influence the election for Trump's benefit. Yet Sessions had little to say on this matter.  Graham opened with a simple query: \"Do you think the Russians were behind hacking into our election?\" Sessions replied, \"I have done no research into that. I know just what the media says about it.\" This was a Trumpy reply, for Sessions was referencing media reports, not the US intelligence community assessment released last week that definitively concluded Russia had hacked Democratic targets and disseminated swiped emails to help Trump. He could have said, \"I know what US intelligence says.\" But he chose not to.  The exchange continued:  Graham: Do you think you could get briefed anytime soon? Sessions: Well, I'll need to. Graham: I think you do too. [Do] you like the FBI? Sessions: Do I like them? Graham: Yeah. Sessions: Some of my best friends are FBI agents. Graham: Do you generally trust them? Sessions: Yes. Graham: Are you aware of the fact that the FBI has concluded that it was the Russian intelligence services who hacked into the DNC and Podesta's emails? Sessions: I do understand that. At least that's what's been reported, and I've not been briefed by them on the subject.  With this answerreferring to media reportsSessions was still apparently trying to not say anything that could be interpreted as a sign he fully accepted the official findings as conclusive and accurate. Apparently, the fellow who wants to run the Justice Department did not bother to look at the intelligence community report on Russian hacking put out last week. (It's short.)  Graham pressed on:  Graham: From your point of view, there's no reason for us to be suspicious of them? Sessions: Of their decision? Graham: Yeah. Sessions: I'm sure it was honorably reached.  Honorably reached? Not that it was an accurate evaluation. Sessions wouldn't say that. He was only stating that he believed that the FBI had not purposefully cooked the books. That was hardly a full embrace of the conclusions. The conversation went on:  Graham: How do you feel about a foreign entity trying to interfere in our election? I'm not saying they changed the outcome, but it's pretty clear to me they did. How do you feel about it? What should we do?  Stop the presses! Graham just said that the Russian hacking did change the outcome of the election. The small number of Republicans who have expressed concern about the intervention have generally stuck to the talking point that the result of the election should not be questioned. Yet here was Graham saying the Russian operation determined that Trump became president. Back to the tape:  Sessions: Sen. Graham, I think it's a significant event. We have penetration apparently throughout our government by foreign entities. We know the Chinese have revealed millions of background information on millions of people in the United States, and these, I suppose, ultimately are part of international big-power politics. But when a nation uses their improperly gained or intelligence-wise gained information to take policy positions that impact another nation's democracy or their approach to any issue, then that raises real serious matters. It's really, I suppose, goes in many ways to the State Department, our Defense Department, and how we, as a nation, have to react to that, which would include developing some protocols where when people breach our systems, that a price is paid even if we can't prove the exact person who did it.  In this word salad, Sessions, once again, would not clearly state that Russia was behind this penetration and that consequently Moscow should be punished. As a Trump partisan, Sessions could not recognize a reality that Trump himself has not accepted. That raises the question of how independent he will be as attorney general, if confirmed, and how vigorously the FBI will be able to investigate this Russian operation on his watch.", "date": "2017/01/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/jeff-sessions-russian-hacking-graham-trump-hearing", "title": "Jeff Sessions Channels Donald Trump on Russian Hacking"}, {"text": "At Thursday's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Russian hacking of Democratic targets during the 2016 campaign, it was obvious that most Republicans don't want to get involved with a matter that puts them on the wrong side of Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the intelligence community's conclusion that Moscow meddled in the election in order to help him win. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chair of the committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), did each decry the Russian intervention and called for a thorough investigation. Yet the other GOPers on the panel were largely mute. This silence suggested that Rs on the Hill are generally not eager to dig into this touchy (for Trump) subject. And that explains why McCain has so far failed in his effort to persuade Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to set up a special select committee to conduct a probe. Instead, McConnell prefers to leave most of this work to the (naturally) overly secretive Intelligence Committee, on which neither McCain nor Graham, the two loudest Republican voices on this front, sit. These machinations demonstrate that politics is shaping how congressional Republicans are reacting to a fundamental threat to American democracy and electoral integrity. And that makes all the more relevant a revived Democratic push to create an independent commission to investigate Russian intervention in the election.  Last month, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Government Oversight Committee, and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, introduced a measure to create a bipartisan commissionmuch like the highly praised 9/11 commissionto probe the Russian hacking. Their proposal did not gain a great amount of attention. Even top Democrats on Capitol Hill who supported the idea were not loudly demanding a robust investigation. But on Friday afternoon, Cummings and Swalwell reintroduced the bill, and this time more than 150 of their fellow House Democrats, including the top Democrat on every House committee, were co-sponsoring the proposed legislation.  The bill would establish a 12-member commission with the authority to interview witnesses, obtain documents, issue subpoenas, and receive public testimony. The panel would examine attempts by the Russian government to influence, interfere with, or undermine trust in last year's US elections. And the commission would have to issue a report with recommendations within 18 months.  With this move, House Democrats are upping the ante, just as the Obama administration is completing its review of the Russian intervention in the election and Trump keeps tweeting positively about Vladimir Putin and suggesting the story has been hyped to taint his election. This week, a bipartisan collection of former senior intelligence and defense officialsincluding former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and former Acting Director of Central Intelligence Michael Morrellissued a letter urging Congress to create this sort of commission to \"understand fully and publicly what happened, how we were so vulnerable, and what we can do to protect our democracy in future elections.\"  It's unlikely that many, if any, Republicans on the Hill will embrace this proposal. But Dems are attempting to generate political pressure. \"There's overwhelming agreement across America that our democracy was attacked this past presidential election,\" Swallwell says. \"Now everyone's asking what our nation's leaders will do about it.\" For most Republicans, the answer seems to be: not much.", "date": "2017/01/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/democrats-turn-pressure-republicans-russian-hacking-investigation", "title": "Democrats Turn Up Pressure on Republicans for Russian Hacking Investigation"}, {"text": "Progressive Democrats gazing upon the fight for the leadership of their party ought to be delighted. The two leading candidates for chair of the Democratic National CommitteeRep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Labor Secretary Tom Perezare each battle-hardened and experienced progressives with much to offer their partisan comrades. Yet the contest for the DNC's top post has widely been cast as a clash between wings of the party, with Ellison as the champion of the insurgent left and Perez as the candidate of the establishment. That depiction misrepresents the face-off and fixates on the wrong question: who has better progressive street cred? With the Democrats deep in the holea minority in both houses of Congress, out of the White House, holding only 16 governor slots and merely 31 of 99 state legislative chambers, and lacking a deep bench or a flock of rising starsthe tussle for DNC chief ought to focus on who can best do the nuts-and-bolts job of rebuilding the party from the ground level.  It's tempting to view this contest as mostly symbolic. The Democratic primary battle of 2016 pitted Bernie Sanders' revolution against Hillary Clinton's pragmatic centrism. Many of Sanders' supporters saw her as a corporate Democrat out of touch withbut eager to exploitthe party's progressive grassroots. Many of Clinton's supporters regarded him as an insurgent who was no true Democrat but happy to trigger tension within the party for his own political advancement. And since Election Day, there has been much jabbering about the rift that remains, with this talk concentrating on the resentment festering among Sanders fans who believe party insiders conspired to sink his candidacy.  So Ellison, one of the few House Democrats to endorse Sanders' presidential run, has been seen as something of a consolation prizeor an offering that can help heal the fractured party. His early entry earned him a rash of key endorsements, including from Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Chuck Schumer. For a few weeks, Ellison, with support from both ends of the Democratic spectrum, seemed like a unity candidate on an easy path to victory.  Then Perez joined the race. He was not a last-minute contestant shoved into the contest by Democratic establishmentarians looking to thwart Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the Housethough some Obama loyalists within the party were clearly not keen on Ellison. Perez, who has been busy finishing up at the Labor Department before handing over the keys to Trumpsters, merely needed more time to make his decision, according to his camp. Yet when Perez, who had endorsed Clinton in the 2016 race, announced his bid, several unions, including the AFL-CIO, which have worked closely with him, were already on the Ellison Express. (Perez has since been backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers, the United Farm Workers, and the International Association of Fire Fighters, and the Democratic governors of Colorado, Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Virginia.) And with Perez's entrance, some Sanders folks started claiming that the Evil Empirethat is, the poohbahs of the partywas once again seeking to crush a progressive insurgency. (Ellison backers have been ticked off that his Democratic opponents have pointed to a handful of Ellison's remarks and his associations with radical black Muslims in the 1990s to undermine his bid.)  This wing-versus-wing dustup is unfortunate for the party. The vote for DNC chairthe person who will be stuck with a mountain of mundane but important tasks and responsibilitiesprobably should not be predicated on symbolism. Nor should it necessarily be a contest over competing issue platformsunless the issue divide truly defines the future course of the party. And that's not what is at stake here. Certainly, Perez, while serving in President Barack Obama's Cabinet, did not oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was backed by the president, and Ellison was a critic of the trade pact. But there's truly not much ideological distance between the two. They are both grassroots-minded progressives. Ellison, before being elected to the House, was a community activist and operated a civil rights, employment, and criminal defense law practice in Minneapolis. Perez, the Buffalo, New York-raised son of two parents exiled from the Dominican Republic, was once the head of CASA de Maryland, an organization advocating for and providing services to immigrants.  And there's no big difference in their big-picture approaches to what must be done within the DNC. Ellison's website declares, \"We must energize Democratic activists across the country and give them the tools to build the Party from the bottom up. Beyond a 50-state strategy, we need a 3,143-county strategy_We must also reclaim our history as the Party that stands with working people.\" Perez's website says, \"In the years ahead, we must strengthen our team, and our bench, from the ground up. And we must stand up to protect President Obama's accomplishments. But most of all, we need to listen. We need to listen to Democrats at every level, empowering them to fight for progressive values and a vision of opportunity and optimism. And we need to listen to voters, up and down the ballot, who are asking us to stand behind them.\" You could transpose these statements and not notice it.  At this point, the Democratic Party needs much rebuildingwhich entails fundraising, strategizing, candidate recruitment, messaging, organizational development, and morefrom local precincts to the national level. So it might be best if the selection of the DNC chief was more job interview and less political wrestling match. Yeah, right. But many of the 447 members of the Democratic Party's national committee, who are the only voters in this contest, might actually view the race in such a way. (This group includes state chairs looking for a national chair who will get them the help and resources they need to succeed at home.) And for them, Perez's rsum could hold strong (and progressive) appeal. (Association declared: Perez is a neighbor, and several times I have socialized in groups with him.)  Perez has had multiple successes overseeing large organizations. After a career that included a stint as a civil rights attorney in the Justice Department (during the George H.W. Bush years) and as a special counsel to Sen. Ted Kennedy on civil rights and criminal and constitutional issues, Perez was appointed by Obama to run the civil rights division of the Justice Department. As Mother Jones reported a few years ago,  During the [George W.] Bush years, the division had been marred by partisan politics and declining civil rights enforcement. But since Perez took the helm, the division has blocked partisan voting schemes, cracked down on police brutality, protected gay and lesbian students from harassment, sued anti-immigrant Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio for racial profiling, stood up against Islamophobia, and forced the two largest fair-housing settlements in history from banks that discriminated against minority homeowners.  While Perez was heading the civil rights division, it mounted a record-breaking number of probes into police abuse, and it achieved wide-ranging agreements to clean up police forces accused of misconduct.  After taking charge of the Labor Department in 2013, Perez fired up that agency. As Politico noted,  It was one of the federal government's sleepier outposts for most of the dozen years that preceded Perez's arrival just over one year ago. But Labor has been newly energized under Perez. \"Enforcement activity is up,\" Alfred Robinson Jr., who was an acting wage and hour administrator for the Labor Department during the George W. Bush administration, noted earlier this month in a blog post. The department has also raised its public profile on issues like minimum wage and paid medical leave and lavished favorable attention on companies that give employees what Perez calls \"voice.\"  At the Labor Department, Perez was in charge of an organization with 17,000 employees, a multibillion-dollar budget, and offices throughout the nation. And he pocketed a number of policy wins. He expanded the overtime rule for millions of workers. He helped resolve the Verizon strike and achieved protections for Verizon's retail workers. On his watch in 2016, the department collected $266 million in back pay owed to workers. He pushed for expanded paid sick leave. The department issued a new rule to protect workers in construction and manufacturing from exposure to dangerous levels of silica dust, which can cause disease and cancer. It raised the minimum wage and and provided extended overtime protections for 2 million home health care workers. The department issued an important conflict-of-interest rule forcing retirement advisers to place clients' interests ahead of their own, an Elizabeth Warren-like measure that could save Americans billions of dollars per year.  Perez has had an impressive run at Labor, overseeing a big bureaucracy and achieving results. He has put his values into practice. Ellison has done similar as a member of Congress, mounting grassroots campaigns, raising money for Democrats across the country, and pushing pro-consumer financial reform legislation as a member of the House financial services committee. If DNCers want to send a welcoming signal to aggrieved (rightly or wrongly) Bernie-ites when they vote on February 24and avoid possible further acrimony between Party HQ and progressive activistsEllison is the obvious choice. But if there is more to the vote than thatand this race is removed from the never-ending conflict between the party and its progressive basePerez is a strong contender. He is a solid progressive with a record of getting stuff done. His prospects will be shaped by whether party officials (they are the only ones who have a vote) consider this contest an act of atonement and reconciliation or a hiring decision.", "date": "2017/01/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/why-tom-perez-strong-competitor-against-keith-ellison-democratic-party", "title": "Why Tom Perez Is a Strong Competitor Against Keith Ellison in the Democratic Party Race"}, {"text": "At Thursday morning's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about Russian hacking during the 2016 elections, little new information was revealed about Moscow's meddling in the presidential campaign. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper did say that the intelligence community's review ordered by President Barack Obama of the Russian operation will be done early next week and will yield an unclassified report for public release. \"I intend to push the envelope as much as I can,\" Clapper said, referring to information the report will make public.  Clapper also noted that the intelligence community is now more \"resolute\" in its assessment that Russian intelligence was behind the cyber thefts and subsequent public dissemination of emails from the Democratic Party and John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign. He also testified that the public report will include an assessment of Moscow's motives behind this operationthe CIA concluded weeks ago that the motive was to boost Donald Trump's prospectsand that there was \"actually more than one motive.\"  Though the hearing did not expand public knowledge of the Russian hack, it did serve a political purpose: to slap Trump for both his refusal to acknowledge Russian involvement in the hacking and his related disparagement of the intelligence community. Several senators seized the opportunity to challenge the president-elect's denialism and to send him a message. Some referred to him directly; some took veiledthough barely veiledshots. Opening the hearing, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the committee's chairman, said there was \"still much we don't know_But Russian intrusions [in the election]_are not in any doubt.\" And Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the senior Democrat on the committee, scoffed at the \"indifference of some to this matter\" and asked Clapper if the hacking was a stand-alone Russian operation. (Clapper replied, \"This was a multifaceted campaign. The hacking was only one part of it. It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news.\")  Other Democratic senators also banged on Trump. Sen. Claire McCaskill thanked McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another member of the committee, for defending the intelligence community against Trump's insults. And referring to Trump's approving tweets about WikiLeaks chief Julian AssangeTrump indicated he believed Assange was more credible that US intelligenceMcCaskill thundered that Trump placing \"Julian Assange on a pedestal\" relative to the men and women of the US intelligence community ought to cause bipartisan outrage. Pointing to widespread Republican silence on this front, she added, \"Mark my word, if the roles were reversed, there would be howls from the Republican side of the aisle.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) later chimed in that Trump's \"disparagement\" of the intelligence community \"has been a terrible disservice to our nation_I hope that we will see a change.\"  Graham also scolded Trump. \"It's okay to challenge the intel,\" he said, adding, \"but what I don't want you to do is undermine\" the intelligence community. Noting that Clapper was due to brief Trump on Friday on Russian hacking and other intelligence matters, Graham asked the nation's top intelligence officer if he was ready to be challenged by the president-elect. \"Yes,\" Clapper replied.  Other than McCain and Graham, the Republican members of the committee shied away from referring to Trump or even the main matter at hand: the Russian hacking. Many asked about other cyber threats and attacks, such as the Chinese hack that penetrated the US government's personnel system. It was just too awkward or politically incorrect for them to question Clapper and the other witnesses about the Moscow operation and Putin's intentions. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) even tried to undermine the intelligence community's assessment that Russia intended to help Trump. \"There's a widespread assumptionthis has been expressed by Secretary Clinton herself since the electionthat Vladimir Putin favored Donald Trump in this election,\" Cotton said. \"Donald Trump has proposed to increase our defense budget, to accelerate nuclear modernization, to accelerate ballistic defenses, and to expand and accelerate oil and gas production, which would obviously harm Russia's economy. Hillary Clinton opposed, or at least was not as enthusiastic about all those measures.\" Cotton asked Clapper, \"Would each of those put the United States in a stronger strategic position against Russia?\" Clapper said that \"anything we do to enhance our military capabilities, absolutely.\" Then Cotton made his point: \"So there is some contrary evidence, despite what the media speculates, that perhaps Donald Trump is not the best candidate for Russia.\" He was suggesting that because Trump's campaign platform had a hawkish military plank, the intelligence community's assessment was wrong and that Trump was not Putin's preferred candidate. Clapper did not respond to this argument.  And Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) won the blame-America-first-to-protect-Trump prize. He tried to diminish the Russian hacking that profited Trump by pointing out that the United States, too, has tried to influence elections overseas:  The glass house comment is something I think is very important. [There was a study] by a professor up at Carnegie Mellon that's estimated that the United States has been involved in one way or another in 81 different elections since World War II. That doesn't include coups or regime changes, so tangible evidence where we've tried to effect an outcome to our purpose. Russia's done it some 36 times. In fact, when Russia was apparently trying to influence our election, we had the Israelis accusing us of trying to influence their election. So I'm not here to talk about that, but I am here to say that we live in a big glass house and there are a lot of rocks to throw and I think that that's consistent with what you said on other matters.  Actually, Tillis was indeed here to talk about this in order to not talk about how Russian intelligence subverted an American election and aided Trump.  Toward the end of the hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Clinton's running mate, took a seat on the dais. When it was his turn to question the witnesses, he noted that a few years ago he was chairman of the Democratic Party and that the party's office contained a filing cabinet that had been rifled during the Watergate break-in. That burglary, he noted, led to a \"high moment\" for Congress, when the House and the Senate conducted bipartisan investigations that sought to protect the integrity of American elections. Referring to the Russian hacking, Kaine said, \"This is a test of this body.\" He wondered if the current Congress would act in a bipartisan fashion to preserve the \"integrity of elections.\" Judging from the ho-hum attitude of most Republicans on the panel toward the Russian intervention, Kaine may end up being disappointed.", "date": "2017/01/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/russian-hacking-hearing-trump-mccain", "title": "At Russian Hacking Hearing, Most Republican Senators Express No Outrage"}, {"text": "CKE franchise employees protest Andrew Puzder's nomination.  Fast-food workers across the country find the idea of Andrew Puzder as secretary of Labor pretty unappetizing.  Labor nominee Puzderwhose company, CKE Restaurants, controls the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chainshas a Senate confirmation hearing scheduled for Thursday, and employees of CKE franchises are pushing back. Protesters rallied in 24 cities earlier this week with signs of Puzder's face superimposed with phrases such as \"Wage Thief\" and \"Tax Cheat.\"  The protests were organized by the minimum-wage campaign Fight for $15, which in late January held a press call with employees to announce the coordinated filing of legal claims against CKE franchise owners. \"Take it from someone who knows firsthand,\" Torrance Chambers, a 36-year-old Hardee's employee from Birmingham, Alabama, said during the call. \"Andy Puzder doesn't respect working people.\"  Chambers said in the three years he's worked at Hardee's, he's never gotten a raise over the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. What's more, he is paid with a preloaded debit card, the basis for a labor violation claim he and his co-workers filed with the Labor Department in January. \"Getting the money that's on the card isn't free,\" he said. \"It comes with $2, $2.50, or even $3 withdrawal and transaction fees at many ATMs and banks. All those fees add up to hours worth of work that goes unpaid. And it means that, at the end of the day, I and many co-workers at Hardee's are paid less than the federal minimum wage. Forget $15Andy Puzder and his company are against a minimum wage of $7.25.\"  The owner of the franchise where Chambers works noted in an email that employees with bank accounts get a direct-deposit option, and those who get debit cards are not charged any fees if they withdraw their paycheck all at once from a participating ATM. George Thompson, a spokesman for Puzder, took issue with the notion that his boss believes in stiffing employees. \"Only 2 percent (114) employees at Andy Puzder's company actually make the minimum,\" he wrote in an email, so Chambers' claim \"is not based in fact.\"  \"Companies can certainly set standards...like Subway has with its franchisees,\" to make sure \"baseline\" laws are followed.  Yet the CKE franchise workers filed a total of 34 claims over a week in January, alleging 23 wage and hour violations, 7 unfair labor practices violations, and 4 sexual-harassment violations. (A handful of subsequent claims brings the total to 39.) CKE did not respond to written questions from Mother Jones related to the claims, but at the time of the protest group's press call, a CKE spokesman offered a statement: \"While we do not comment on pending litigation, we'd like to offer a reminder that CKE Restaurants is nearly 95 percent franchised. Each of these 2,769 franchise stores are run independently and solely responsible for their employees, management and adherence to regulations and labor practices.\"  Asked about this line of defense during the Fight for $15 press call, Cathy Ruckelshaus of the National Employment Law Project responded, \"It's my understanding that none of these claims have actually charged CKE with violations. But the magnitude of these violations and the pervasiveness of them suggests that the culture at the company is not one of complying with these basic laws.\"  She continued, \"Companies can make a choice about who they operate with, who they contract with in a franchise agreement. And they can certainly set standards and issue directives, like Subway has with its franchisees, to make sure that baseline minimum wage, health and safety, and discrimination laws are followed.\"  Tom Perez, Obama's labor secretary, interpreted current workplace laws to mean that parent companies could be held accountable for the behavior of franchise ownersbut labor law may be viewed differently under the Trump administration.  Employees in Las Vegas say they were pressured to work unpaid overtime and were not paid for breaks as required by law.  Taken together, the claims filed last month seem to depict a corporate culture designed to maximize profits regardless of employees' well-being, and one that is quick to stifle workers' efforts to improve their conditions.  A female worker in Tampa, Florida, alleged that her shift manager threatened her with sexual violence after repeated incidents of harassment, saying, \"If you don't start giving me what I want, I am going to start taking.\" When she reported the incident to a different supervisor, she was moved to a less desirable shift, she said, where she made less money. (Reached by phone, the franchise owner in question said he was unaware of the claim.)  An employee in Whittier, California, made a similar claim; she was harassed during the graveyard shift by a male co-worker, she said, yet was repeatedly scheduled to work with him even after she reported the harassment to her manager. After she finally refused to work with the man, she was fired, according to her claim. (The owner of her franchise said in an email that the woman was fired for \"repeat absenteeism and multiple service audit failures.\" He added, \"We are investigating this claim and will take action based on the results of the investigation.\")  In Oakland, California, a male fast-food worker said his manager routinely harassed him about his sexual orientation. In nearby Alameda, an employee alleged that compensation for several hours of overtime has been routinely withheld from her over the course of five years. Sometimes she is paid for only 8 of the 10 hours she works per day, she says.  CKE franchise employees in Las Vegas say they were pressured to work unpaid overtime and were not paid for breaks as required by lawtheir manager, they alleged, routinely manipulated time records to reduce labor costs. The workers also allege that they faced an overly broad prohibition on discussing working conditions, and were told not to speak to the press or union organizers. They received an email that read, \"It is company policy that no one in this franchise is to talk to any reporter or individual asking questions about our operations.\" The email stated that the mandate was \"part of our franchise agreement with CKE and that \"employees who fail to observe this policy will potentially face disciplinary action.\"  Puzder's spokesman calls Fight for $15 an \"astroturf\" group whose \"activists have attacked Andy Puzder with baseless and fabricated claims.\"  A claim from Durham, North Carolina, alleges that job applicants at one CKE franchise were asked whether they supported Fight for $15's efforts to increase the minimum wage. Managers at that same franchise, the claim says, surveilled and photographed workers participating in a workers' rights rally, filed a police report against a union employee who was attempting to speak to workers, and fired an employee in retaliation for participating in union activity.  A Los Angeles worker, Ivan Nava, said that when his manager \"found out that I had started organizing for the Fight for $15, she cut my hours from six to eight hours a day down to as little as four hours a day, and started scheduling my shifts when she knew I had college classes.\" He filed a claim accusing the franchise of \"implicitly threatening Ivan Nava with retaliation for engaging in union activity.\"  The Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing the federal minimum wage. The agency is also tasked with making sure American workers get paid for all the hours they work, that labor conditions are safe and humane, and that workplace discrimination and sexual harassment are discouragedand taken seriously when they do occur.  But even prior to the January complaints, CKE's franchisees had a questionable track record in some of these categories. In a survey of hundreds of CKE franchise employees conducted by an advocacy group for restaurant workers, 66 percent of the female respondents reported being subjected to \"unwanted sexual behaviors\" at workthe industry standard is 40 percent.  Fight for $15 cites a report by the investigative publication Capital & Main showing that, since Puzder took over as CEO in 2000, Carl's Jr. and Hardee's have been sued for federal employment discrimination more often than any other American hamburger chain. Thompson, Puzder's spokesman, points to a rebuttal in Investor's Business Daily by the conservative economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth.  Workers' accounts, note Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Patty Murray, make clear that CKE franchise workers \"are overworked and underpaid and lack basic benefits.\"  The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, noted in a recent report that from 2000 through 2016, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration found 91 safety violations at CKE franchises32 were listed as serious, meaning they \"could result in death or grave physical harm.\" Because fast-food restaurants are not subject to random OSHA investigations, the authors argued, each of the violations must have resulted from an anonymous complaint: \"What is clear is that CKE is a representative of the kind of corner-cutting that hurts workers.\"  \"Recently the restaurant I worked at went an entire month without paying me a dime,\" claimant Angel Gallegos, who works at a Carl's Jr. in Los Angeles, said during the Fight for $15 press call, \"and they only agreed to pay me after I stopped coming to work in protest. If Andy Puzder can't be trusted to pay his workers what they've earned, why should we expect him to enforce laws meant to protect working Americans?\"  Thompson dismisses Fight for $15 as an \"astroturf\" group whose \"activists have attacked Andy Puzder with baseless and fabricated claims.\"  Gallegos' sentiment was echoed by many of the CKE franchise workers who have hit the streets to protest Puzder's nomination. \"Andy Puzder makes more in a DAY than I make in a YEAR, read one protest sign in St. Louis. \"Puzder gets rich by keeping workers poor,\" read another one in Philadelphia. \"Andrew Puzder is a rich fast food CEO, not our labor secretary,\" said signs in Chicago.  Fight for $15 has also mobilized non-CKE fast-food employees to rally against the nominee. And the Economic Policy Institute and Jobs with Justice have teamed up for a joint initiative to defeat Puzder, whom they call \"grossly out of touch with Americans who struggle to make ends meet\" and \"an especially dangerous choice for Labor Secretary.\"  The protesters have found allies in Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who released a report containing testimonies from a range of CKE franchise employees. The senators didn't mince words:  \"The accounts in this report make clear that workers at Mr. Puzder's restaurants are overworked and underpaid and lack basic benefits, and that he has repeatedly refused to stand up for workers during his tenure as CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc. They provide new and compelling evidence that Mr. Puzder is unqualified to lead the Department of Labor.\"  Then again, concerns about lack of qualifications has yet to stop any of President Donald Trump's cabinet picks.", "date": "2017/02/15", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/andrew-puzder-cke-restaurants-employees-fight-trump-labor-secretary-nomination", "title": "Workers Allege Violations at Franchises of Company Run by Trump's Labor Nominee"}, {"text": "Donald Trump and congressional Republicans emerged victorious in November thanks in part to their repeated denunciations of Obamacare. At a rally in July, Trump noted the efficacy of attacks on the Affordable Care Act: \"One of the things that gets constantly_the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\" Since the election, some Republican lawmakers have softened their stance a bit, suggesting that Obamacare may simply be \"scaled back.\" But there's little doubt that they will still make a show of upholding their promise to chip away at, if not totally repeal, Obamacare. Trump, who once advocated universal health coverage, has said he will replace the existing plan with \"something terrific,\" though he has yet to offer a serious alternative.  Here's another catch: While most Americans say they dislike Obamacare, they actually like most of its provisions. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, every major part of the Affordable Care Act is exceedingly popular except for onethe imposition of fines for not having health coverage. This might explain why some Trump voters are reacting with alarm now that they realize some kind of ACA repeal looks likely.  If Obamacare is fully repealed, most Americans will see a modest tax cut, while tens of millions will face a loss of coverage or become uninsurable.

Sessions called a press conference late on Thursday to announce he would step back from any relevant investigations.  So who is Kislyak anyway?  For the last nine years, Kislyak has served as Russia's ambassador to the United States, an unusually long stint, according to CNN. Before becoming an ambassador, he served as Russia's deputy minister of foreign affairs, where he helped negotiate international arms control agreements. Kislyak reportedly first joined the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 1977 after graduating from the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute.  I heard something about Kislyak being a Russian spy. Is that true?  Maybe? According to CNN, Kislyak has been described by current and former US intelligence officials as a top spy and spy recruiter. A Russian government spokesperson dismissed the allegations, describing them as \"depersonalized assumptions of the media that are constantly trying to blow this situation out of proportion.\"  What does Kislyak think about the United States?  Back in October, Kislyak told the Detroit Economic Club that Russia had \"become collateral damage in the fight between the two parties here.\" The next month he said the two countries were \"living through the worst time in our relationship,\" a curious claim considering mutually assured destruction doesn't seem to be on the table. Here's an interesting tidbit from a State Department cable released by WikiLeaks: After meetings with a handful of Russian officials in 2007, including Kislyak, an Israeli official came away with the view that \"Russia hates the U.S., wants to become an empire again, and feels empowered because of its oil.\" The Israeli reported that the Russians he met with \"see cooperation with the U.S. as endangering their own strategic interests.\"", "date": "2017/03/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/sergey-kislyak-russian-ambassador", "title": "Who's the Russian Ambassador at the Center of Two Trump Administration Scandals?"}, {"text": "When the Trump administration rescinded the Obama-era guidance outlining protections for transgender students Wednesday, the signature at the bottom of the letter wasn't that of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The directive came instead from the man currently running the department's civil rights division, Thomas E. Wheeler. (The letter was also signed by Sandra Battle, who's heading the civil rights division of the Department of Education.)  As acting head of the division, Wheeler is responsible for enforcing federal law on voting rights, LGBT protections, employment discrimination, police misconduct, and other civil rights issues. Wheeler, who previously worked for Vice President Mike Pence and served as a top official at Republican National Lawyers Association, has a history of supporting strict voter ID laws. His stances on some other issues are less clear, but he has given a number of presentations with rather intriguing titles.  Here's a selection of Wheeler's speeches that were once listed on the website of Frost Brown Todd, a prominent Midwestern law firm where he used to work:  \"Student Diversity Issues,\" Green River Regional Educational Cooperative's Annual School Law Institute, August 2014  \"Armed Teachers in Schools, a Legislative Overview,\" National School Board Association's Annual School Law Seminar, October 2013  \"Ethics in Campaigns, an Oxymoron?\" Republican National Lawyers Association's Election Law School, August 2013  \"Arming Teachers to Prevent Tragedies, Responding to Sandy Hook,\" Liberty Mutual Insurance National Webinar, January 2013  \"Litigation Over Indiana's Photo ID Law,\" Republican National Lawyers Association's Election Law School, August 2012  \"Indiana's Photo ID Law and ACORN Voter Fraud,\" Republican National Lawyers Association's Election Law School, August 2009  \"Same Day Voting and Voter Registration,\" Republican National Lawyers Association's Election Law School, August 2004  Wheeler doesn't appear to be eager to share the content of these talks. Through a DOJ spokesperson, he declined to make audio, video, transcripts, or any other versions of these presentations available. Many of the groups that sponsored Wheeler's presentations, such as the Republican National Lawyers Association and the National School Boards Association (where Wheeler served on the board of directors) also declined to release the presentations.  Mother Jones did obtain the PowerPoint accompanying the \"Student Diversity Issues\" presentation Wheeler gave at the Green River Regional Educational Cooperative's Annual School Law Institute in 2014. While it's unclear what Wheeler said, the PowerPoint outlines various issues schools face regarding transgender students and gives an overview of relevant legal cases.

While the most talked about part of Obama's rules allowed students to use the bathroom that aligned best with their identity, the guidance also explained teachers should use students' chosen name and pronoun and recommended steps to limit access to and amend transgender students' school records. The move, which comes in a joint letter from the departments of justice and education, rescinds all such protections.  \"This is [the administration] saying very clearly to anti-trans bullies...'These students are not worthy of protection....and we are not going to enforce the law,'\" says Mara Keisling, the head of the National Center for Transgender Equality.  The letter claims rescinding the standing rules \"does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying, or harassment,\" and emphasizes that schools are responsible for ensuring all students \"are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment.\" But unlike Obama's directive, which specified that a hostile environment could, for example, be established by failing to recognize students gender identity, the Trump administration's letter gives no such guidance. That nod to bullying and harassment was reportedly added at the urging of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who, according to the New York Times, expressed discomfort at rescinding the guidance. When asked Wednesday about infighting between DeVos and Attorney General Sessions, who pushed strongly to rescind the guidance and who has long history of opposing LGBTQ rights, the administration maintained DeVos supports the move \"100 percent.\"  Without federal policies, transgender students' rights will be inconsistent state to state and even between school districts and individual schools. In a statement released shortly after the letter, DeVos argued this \"is an issue best solved at the state and local level...Schools, communities, and families can findand in many cases have foundsolutions that protect all students.\"  \"No child in America should have their rights subject to their zip code,\" said Eliza Byard Executive Director of GLSEN, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making schools safe for LGBTQ students.  The Obama administration developed the guidance after the Education Department received questions from educators, administrators, parents, and students about how Title IX, a law which bans sex discrimination in educational programs and schools receiving federal assistance, protects transgender students. Bathroom access proved to be controversial, but it was seen as a key step towards compliance with the law by department officials.  \"Students in kindergarten, elementary school classes are made to line up by boys and girls to go to the bathroom,\" said Catherine Lhamon, a former assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education who helped develop the guidance. \"Transgender students had to face a choice everyday about which line to get in and answering questions from their peers about why they're in one line versus another, and that causes harm and humiliation to a student to have to explain.\"  Private bathrooms can also invite questions from other students, be far from classes, or require an adult to unlock them, which can make students late for class.  \"There were physical consequences to students of having to go through extra barriers just to be able to relieve themselves at school,\" she says. \"There were psychological consequences to students from having to explain who they are inside everyday to other students rather than just being able to be who they are.\"  The Trump administration's decision to roll back the protections comes just weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear its first transgender rights case. Virginia high schooler Gavin Grimm sued his school board after it adopted a policy barring him from the men's bathroom.

The classified guidance, which was reviewed by Mother Jones, suggests that President Donald Trump's daily national security briefing contains far less information than the daily reports presented by the intelligence community to past presidentsand about a quarter of the information President Barack Obama received. The memo sent to certain analysts within the intelligence community notes that the commander in chief's daily briefing book typically contains reports on only three topics, typically no more than one page each. According to the guidance, Trump's PDB also includes space for a short update, presumably on matters brought up in previous briefs. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the process of producing the PDB, declined to comment on the memo. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  \"That unfortunately sounds like_bowing to the reality of a president with a short attention span and little ability to deal with ambiguities,\" says former CIA official Paul Pillar.  The guidance states that analysts should only include facts that support their analyses, and it explains that topics presented in the PDB will not be covered from different perspectives in separate briefings. That means that dissenting or conflicting views might not be presented to Trump. Obama's PDB did include dissenting information, when appropriate, according to a former top CIA official with direct knowledge of the PDB.  Presumably, the memo's guidelinesless material, less nuance, less dissentwere developed in response to Trump's reactions to the materials he has received. If the memo does not reflect direct instructions from Trump or his aides to the intelligence community, it is a reflection of the assumptions senior intelligence officials have developed about how best to present information to Trump.  \"These issues about the overall length of the book as well as whether there are going to be conflicting interpretationsthat unfortunately sounds like_bowing to the reality of a president with a short attention span and little ability to deal with ambiguities,\" says Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and Georgetown University.  In December, Trump alarmed the national security community when he said in an interview that he did not require daily intelligence briefings, which he found monotonous and repetitive. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\" he said. The following month, as he was about to assume office, he told Axios that he preferred his briefing materials to be succinct, preferably no longer than a page: \"I like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don't need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page. That I can tell you.\" In a recent story about turmoil within the National Security Council, the New York Times noted Trump's preference for shorter briefing documents, reporting that \"while Mr. Obama liked policy option papers that were three to six single-spaced pages, council staff members are now being told to keep papers to a single page, with lots of graphics and maps.\"  In comparison to Trump's three-page PDB, the former senior CIA official who served during the Obama administration estimates the former president's daily brief typically ranged from 12 to 14 pages, and it contained videos, maps, charts, and interactive features. Obama tended to read it on a tablet. Historically, the documentwhich relays key intelligence and national security informationhas averaged six to eight pages, according to David Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings to America's Presidents From Kennedy to Obama.  Trump's daily brief appears to be significantly shorter than that of other modern presidents, but Priess says the document often evolves over the course of a commander in chief's term. \"Many of these topics are new even to an experienced politician, much less somebody like the president who has not been immersed in national security or political affairs before,\" he explains.  Priess notes that the PDB varies based on the personality and style of every president, and it is the intelligence community's job to communicate the information in a way the president can easily understand. In fact, Priess jokes in his book that the PDB is so tailored to each president that if the commander in chief wants the daily brief communicated through interpretive dance, analysts have to take dance lessons. But he says the PDB is no laughing matter. \"Any president who chooses not to incorporate the objective analysis as contained in the President's Daily Brief does so at his own peril,\" he explains. \"Everybody else in the national security bureaucracy has a policy preference or a stake in decisions being made and getting those ideas in front of the president.\"  James Jeffery, who served as deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration and who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says he doesn't see a shortened PDB as a reason for concern, as long as Trump is open to intelligence and national security experts updating him throughout the day, if needed. \"Two months ago, the big shock was he wasn't getting these things at all, so [if] he's actually getting them every day, that's a step in the right direction,\" Jeffrey comments.  Priess agrees the length and style of the daily brief is not necessarily cause for worry, but he points out that when a crisis hits, the president may be less prepared if he's not getting the extensive analysis his predecessors received. \"There may be more need for the backstory and the explanations during the crisis than he would have if he absorbed more assessments every day,\" Priess explains. \"The caveat to that, of course, is if he would simply not read anything if more assessments were put in front of him, if he would just not bother to read it at all because it did not fit his style, then it would be counterproductive anyway.\"", "date": "2017/02/16", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/classified-memo-tells-intelligence-analysts-keep-trumps-daily-brief-short", "title": "Exclusive: Classified Memo Tells Intelligence Analysts to Keep Trump's Daily Brief Short"}, {"text": "Update, 12:30 p.m.: The Oklahoma House Public Health Committee voted to send HB 1441 and HB 1549 to the full House of Representatives for consideration.    In Oklahoma, abortion rights advocates breathed a big sigh of relief when a particularly draconian measure, requiring a woman seeking an abortion to get written approval from the man who impregnated her, was tabled last week. That sigh may have come too soon: The state's House Public Health Committee is set to reconsider HB 1441 today. The proposal would require a woman to get written permission for an abortion from the biological father, identify him to her doctor in writing, and allow him to demand a paternity test.  This measure is the latest in a series of efforts to limit access to abortion in Oklahoma. Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, has signed 20 anti-abortion bills over the course of her six-year tenure, including measures that tripled the waiting period from 24 to 72 hours and banned the use of telemedicine to administer medication abortion. Initially, state Rep. Justin Humphrey called his proposal an effort to make sure fathers support their child from conception, but as the Intercept reports, the lawmaker clarified his position when he said:  I believe one of the breakdowns in our society is that we have excluded the man out of all of these types of decisions. I understand that [women] feel like that is their body. I feel like it is a separatewhat I call them is, is you're a \"host.\" And you know when you enter into a relationship youre going to be that host and so, you know, if you pre-know that then take all precautions and dont get pregnant.  Humphrey did not respond to a request for comment from Mother Jones.  \"Bodily autonomy is being actively stripped away from women in the state of Oklahoma,\" says the Reverend Shannon Speidel, a board member with the Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice. \"For [Humphrey] to refer to women simply as hosts, hosts for a pregnancy, indicates that we as women do not have the ability or the responsibility to make decisions about our own body to the point that we will now have to have a man's permission to be able to seek an abortion if needed.\"  She says that lawmakers are wasting taxpayer dollars by focusing on limiting access to abortion in Oklahoma, especially with a budget shortfall already totaling almost $900 million. \"I'm really disturbed by services_and access to medical care being stripped from poor families in the state of Oklahoma,\" she says. \"And yet these legislators are still going after this issue, which is going to have to be fought in court and paid for by us, the citizens of Oklahoma.\"  Speidel would like to say she's confident the bill won't become law, but Oklahoma's legislative history of anti-abortion measures has taught her \"it's likely that it might.\" Members of the state House committee will also consider whether to move another proposal forward that abortion rights advocates thought had been tabled for the session.

But it's something he said later in the speech that has government watchdog groups more concerned.  \"I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,\" Trump said. The Johnson Amendment prohibits tax-exempt charitable organizations, including churches, from engaging in political activity. Groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy organization based in Arizona, argue the law leads to self-censorship among religious leaders. During his campaign for president, Trump had promised to scrap it.  \"It violates the constitutional rights for pastors to speak freely from the pulpit on all matters of life,\" says Erik Stanley, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom. \"It's been enforced in a very vague way. Nobody really knows what it prohibits and what it allows, and that's a problem when you're talking about a speech restriction.\" The group has encouraged pastors to engage in political speech and get in trouble with the IRS so it can launch a constitutional challenge to the law.  Others, such as the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, counter that the speech of religious leaders isn't the only thing at stake. Repealing the law, they say, would have major consequences for money in politics.  \"Charitable nonprofits are kind of the next frontier, which would_significantly increase the amount of dark money out there in a way that is alarming,\" says Noah Bookbinder, executive director of CREW. Getting rid of the Johnson Amendment, he says, could quickly increase the amount of undisclosed political spending for two reasons. First, those contributions would be tax-deductible, encouraging more and larger contributions. Second, it would be easy for many of these groups to start spending significant amounts of money immediately.  \"You have these ready-made, very large organizations that could do a lot of political spending,\" Bookbinder says. \"You wouldn't have the challenges of having to set up a new organization and raise a lot of money for it.\"  Lyndon B. Johnson introduced the legislation to amend the tax code in 1954, when he was a US senator, in an effort to silence groups campaigning against him. Opponents of repealing the legislation say today's concerns about dark money were not a problem back then.  Stanley says his group is focused on lifting the speech restrictions of religious leaders, not all the restrictions on political activity. Even so, he doesn't oppose a full repeal of the ban.  \"If Congress ultimately decides that it wants to repeal the Johnson Amendment entirely, we would support that,\" Stanley says. \"We trust the churches of America to do what's right and to police themselves.\"", "date": "2017/02/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-prayer-breakfast-johnson-amendment", "title": "Trump's Latest Promise Threatens to Bring More Dark Money Into Politics"}, {"text": "Conservatives now hold the governor's seat and control of the legislature in roughly half of all states, and since the election they've quickly gotten to work proposing measures that opponents say could threaten the rights and safety of transgender people. Human rights advocates say they're fearing an onslaught of discriminatory bills in the coming months.  \"We are seeing them already in an impressive number of states given how early in the legislative session it is,\" says HRC's Cathryn Oakley.  \"We are seeing them already in an impressive number of states given how early in the legislative session it is,\" says Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, though she adds that \"some at this point are still rumored.\" By HRC's estimate, at least 40 anti-LGBT proposals have already been introduced for the legislative sessions this year.  Some of the measures are so-called bathroom bills (made famous by North Carolina's HB2), which ban transgender people from using the restroom of their choice, often under the guise of privacy and \"protecting women and children.\" As Oakley explains, these bills are bad policy not only because they infringe on the rights of transgender people, but also because of the damage they can inflict on a state's economy. After North Carolina passed HB2 last year, several businesses decided to pull plans to expand in the state, local governments banned official travel to North Carolina, and events like the NCAA basketball championship were moved elsewhere.  Other proposals would force schools to out transgender students to their parents, something advocates find particularly troubling. Up to 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBT. Whether their parents accept their gender identity has a significant impact on the mental health outcomes of young transgender people. \"It risks their long-term health care outcomes and economic future by endangering their ability to protect their own privacy and move safely through the world,\" explains Sasha Buchert with the Transgender Law Center.  Here's a roundup of anti-transgender proposals in state governments since the election:  Alabama: SB1  This bill is intended to be a \"backstop\" if the courts overturn North Carolina's bathroom law. Under the proposed legislation, all bathrooms and changing facilities in the state must be designed for use \"by one person at a time\" or \"multiple persons of the same gender.\" Gender-neutral bathrooms meant for multiple people would have to be \"staffed by an attendant stationed at the door of each rest room to monitor the appropriate use of the rest room and answer any questions or concerns posed by users.\" Any business, school, or other entity violating these rules would be subject to a fine of a minimum of $2,000 for the first violation and at least $3,500 for each subsequent violation.  As ThinkProgress points out, the bill, proposed by state Sen. Phil Williams (R-Rainbow City), is written in such a vague way that it's actually unclear if it would actually have any impact on transgender people. Still, Williams made his intention clear in an op-ed announcing the bill: \"The argument that a self-professed 'gender identity' affords access to a facility over the deep concerns of other members of the public is a violation of that right to privacy.\"  Arizona: HB 2293, HB 2294  Transgender people already cannot get sex reassignment surgery under Arizona's Medicaid system. Now, state Rep. Anthony Kern's (R-Glendale) HB 2294 would formally codify that reality into law, which transgender rights advocates worry could make accessing the surgery even more difficult in the future.  Kern also introduced HB 2293, which would prohibit people who are incarcerated from getting sex reassignment surgery. \"Any medical procedures that doctors deem are medically necessary for particular individuals to treat their gender dysphoria should be covered by insurance of every kind,\" Abby Jensen, vice president of Southern Arizona Gender Alliance and a board member of Equality Arizona, told Mother Jones. \"There is no reason to single out transgender people for that exclusion, especially when the procedures that we're talking about are commonly paid for by the same insurance plans for other conditions.\"  Jensen's also troubled by another piece of legislation, SB 1199, that would require people seeking to change their name to undergo a criminal background check. The sponsor of the bill says it \"would not make it easier or harder\" for a transgender person to get a name change and is intended to keep people from masking their criminal history. But Jensen worries the legislation could have a disproportionate impact on transgender people: \"Because of discrimination and bias against trans people, we are arrested and incarcerated at much higher rates than the general population,\" she said. \"A criminal background check could give judges an excuse to deny a name change petition.\" While such a denial may be reversible on appeal, Jensen adds, \"very few trans people have legal representation and there are no LGBT legal advocacy organizations currently active in Arizona.\"  Kansas: HB 2171  The measure would prohibit transgender students from accessing the locker rooms, showers, and restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. It defines sex as \"determined by a person's chromosomes\" and \"identified at birth by a person's anatomy.\" Under the proposal, any citizen could complain directly to the attorney general about an offending school if the school does not \"cure a violation\" within three days. The attorney general could then sue the school if it determines after an investigation that legal action is warranted.  \"The bill on its face is just an attack on little kids,\" said Tom Witt, director of Equality Kansas.  \"The bill on its face is just an attack on little kids,\" Tom Witt, director of Equality Kansas, told the Topeka Capita-Journal. \"I am just incredibly angry and disappointed that anyone would introduce such a thing in this state.\"  Kentucky: HB106  In Kentucky, the typical political dichotomy has been turned on its head: A Democrat is actually leading the anti-transgender charge, and Republican leadership has spoken out against the idea of legislating where transgender people can pee. State Rep. Rick Nelson's (D-Middlesboro) bill will require people using state and local government bathrooms to use the facility in line with the sex on their birth certificate. Nelson has also introduced a so-called \"religious freedom bill,\" which would allow businesses to legally discriminate against LGBT people.  Missouri: SB 98  Some lawmakers in Missouri don't want transgender students in public schools using the bathroom or locker room that matches their gender identity. The legislation, introduced by state Sen. Ed Emery (R-Lamar), would force students to use the bathroom based on their sex as \"determined by a person's chromosomes.\" Emery is promoting his legislation by stoking fears: \"If you had a daughter, you might not feel that she was completely safe if young men were allowed into her shower room, and vice versa,\" he said, according to St. Louis Public Radio.  Under his legislation, a student seeking a special accommodation, such as using a private bathroom, needs parental permission to do someaning the student would need to be out to his or her parents. The bill explicitly states that no special accommodations can be made to allow the student into their desired bathroom or locker room.  South Carolina: Bill 3012  A bathroom bill in South Carolina failed to even make it to a vote on the Senate floor last year, with several lawmakers and the governor deciding they weren't interested in such legislation in the wake of the backlash in North Carolina to HB2. But now, state Rep. Steven Long (R-Boiling Springs) decided to soften the proposal in hopes of getting it passed. Instead of prohibiting transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice, the new proposal aims to let businesses decide whether to discriminate by banning local governments from requiring businesses to allow transgender patrons their choice of restroom.    South Dakota: SB 115  Two lawmakers in South Dakota have also introduced softer legislation after Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill last year that would have prohibited transgender students in public schools from using the bathroom and locker rooms of their choice. The new proposal only applies to locker rooms and other changing facilities, but is expected to meet the same fate as last year's legislation. The governor's chief of staff has already said Daugaard would veto the bill if it came to his desk, telling the Associated Press that it's \"substantially the same.\"  Texas: SB6, SB242  Texas Republicans are trying to push through legislation that would prohibit transgender people from using the bathroom they choose in public schools and buildings. SB6 would also stop local governments from passing nondiscrimination rules, meaning businesses and other privately owned facilities will ultimately decide whether or not to limit bathroom access. Violating the rules would lead to a fine of at least $1,000 for the first offense and jump to $10,000 for each subsequent offense.  Whether the legislation will pass remains unclear. The state House speaker says it's not a priority and many in the business community are pushing back against the law. However, the lieutenant governor is leading the charge, and the state Senate seems keen to limit bathroom access, therefore risking an estimated $8.5 billion a year to the state according to the Texas Association of Business. Gov. Greg Abbott hasn't publicly supported the bill, but this hot take from last year gives some pretty clear insight to his thoughts on the matter at hand:  JFK wanted to send a man to the moon. Obama wants to send a man to the women's restroom. We must get our country back on track. #tcot  Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) May 17, 2016  Also under review by the Texas Legislature is another proposal that states parents are entitled to all information schools have regarding their child's psychological and emotional well-being. LGBT advocacy organization Equality Texas says this bill would force school employees to out students in some cases. SB 242's author argues this is not the case, but if a parent asks for information, school employees would be legally required to provide it under the proposal.  \"If your kid is gay, and can tell his teacher, but hasn't told you, then you are the problem,\" said Equality Texas Board Chairman Steven Rudner in a statement opposing the legislation. \"If a kid can tell a teacher but not their parent, it is a pretty good indication that your child is scared of you and the consequences of telling you, and you are who the kid needs to be protected from.\"  Virginia: HB 1612  Delegate Bob Marshall's (R-Prince William) bill, which has already been killed, would have limited bathroom access in schools and other government facilities. When one transgender man recently asked proponents of the bill where they thought he should use the restroom, Marshall responded, \"Not here.\" Advocates say Marshall's bill was especially dangerous because of a provision that would require schools to out students to their parents within 24 hours if they asked \"to be recognized or treated as the opposite sex.\"  Gov. Terry McAuliffe had vowed to veto the legislation. In fact, he extended protections to transgender workers just days after the bill was introducedsigning an executive order banning the state from doing business with any group that discriminates based on sexual orientation or gender identity.    Washington: HB1011  You might think Washington state lawmakers would drop the issue of where transgender people can go to the bathroom considering the state passed nondiscrimination protections all the way back in 2006, and multiple efforts to restrict bathroom access failed last year. However, 14 Republican state lawmakers have introduced a bill that states nondiscrimination laws do not prohibit public and private institutions from limiting bathroom access based on someone's genitals.  Transgender rights advocates point out the kicker with this bill is that it highlights the absurd anxiety some people have about what's in people's pants by explicitly referring to genitalia: The legislation states that nondiscrimination protections don't apply \"if the person is preoperative, nonoperative, or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated.\"    Wyoming: HB 244  Most of the bathroom bills across the nation put the onus on schools or the government to keep transgender people out of the bathroom of their choice, but in Wyoming, legislation has been introduced to make using a public bathroom or changing facility that does not correspond to your sex assigned at birth an act of public indecency. Under this legislation, transgender people could be incarcerated for up to six months and fined $750 for using the bathroom.", "date": "2017/01/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/transgender-rights-bathrooms-state-legislature-texas-arizona-wyoming-kansas", "title": "Transgender Rights Are Under Attack in These 11 States"}, {"text": "In recent decades, the federal government has turned to private corporations to help handle everything from intelligence to prisons. Should nuclear waste be next?  That's a question currently being considered by the Department of Energy, as it looks for solutions to the long-standing problem of how to store radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. Now, with Rick Perry slated to head the department, the issue could become more complicated. That's because the former Texas governor has deep ties to a waste disposal company that could create a significant conflict of interest once he becomes energy secretary.  \"Lo and behold, the company that lobbied to get the legislation passed and gave lots of political contributions was the only applicant, so it was a real corporate sweetheart deal.\"  Nuclear waste is currently held at power plants across the countrysome of which are no longer operating. The federal government was supposed to start consolidating the waste from these plants nearly 20 years ago, but it hasn't been able to find a way to dispose of it. In 1987, the feds determined that a site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada would be the perfect dumpster for high-level nuclear waste (such as used reactor fuel), but opposition to the plan began almost immediately. Finally, in 2010, the Obama administration cut funding for Yucca Mountain in response to local opposition and the efforts of Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was the Senate majority leader at the time. With the new administration taking over and Reid retiring, it's unclear whether the project will be revived.  Because Yucca Mountain had been stalled for so long, the federal government began to explore the possibility of working with private companies for interim storage of the wastea temporary solution that could last for decades. Testifying at a Senate hearing in September 2016, Obama administration Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz explained this \"novel approach\" could help the government follow through on its obligation to collect the nuclear waste, and his department began to ask private companies for information about how it would work.  During his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Perry emphasized that obligation remains a pressing concern. \"Hopefully this is the beginning of seeing real movement, real management of an issue that I think no longer can sit and be used as a political football, one that must be addressed,\" he said. \"And I think we can find a solution both in the interim and in the long term.\"  One company eager to get in on interim storage is Texas-based Waste Control Specialists, which last year applied for a license with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and will be submitting a preliminary proposal to the Department of Energy before the end of the month to store high-level nuclear waste for the federal government. In order to get a contract with the Department of Energy and store the waste, the company would need to obtain a license from the NRC. (The two agencies are independent from each other.) An NRC spokesperson said the license approval process would take a minimum of three years.  Watchdogs worry the company's ties to Perry could create a conflict of interest. As Mother Jones previously reported, WCS lobbied the Texas Legislature for six years to pass legislation that would allow private companies in the state to be responsible for the disposal of low-level nuclear waste. (Low-level waste consists of things like clothing, cleaning supplies, and other items exposed to radiation.) The legislation passed in 2003, and Perry signed it.  When the new system went into effect, WCS was the only company that applied for a state license to handle the waste. A panel of state engineers and geologists determined in 2007 that groundwater contamination at WCS' proposed disposal site in West Texas was \"highly likely.\" WCS countered that such contamination wasn't possible. \"The state of Texas required over 600 test wells at a variety of depths to address questions about any possibility of subsurface water before issuing the license,\" WCS spokesman Chuck McDonald said. \"Those questions were answered emphatically.\"  Despite the reviewers' concerns, the three Perry-appointed members on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality signed off on the license. Three staffers at the agency resigned in protest over the decision. \"We knew from the beginning that this permit was intended to be issued,\" Glenn Lewis, a member of the review panel, said in a 2011 interview with NPR.  Many opponents of the plan cried foul, pointing to the relationship between Perry and Harold Simmons, the company's owner at the time. Simmons, who has since died, was one of Perry's biggest contributors throughout his career, giving his campaigns more than $1.3 million. When the Texas governor ran for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, Simmons was one of his largest donors. (Simmons also helped fund the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004.) Critics of Texas' deal with WCS, such as the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, have suggested that Simmons' relationship with Perry may have helped WCS get the permits.  \"Lo and behold, the company that lobbied to get the legislation passed and gave lots of political contributions was the only applicant, so it was a real corporate sweetheart deal,\" Cyrus Reed of the Texas Sierra Club said.  McDonald denies that the company received any special treatment. According to McDonald, WCS invested more than $500 million to license and construct the facility in West Texas and won't be able to recoup that investment for decades. He calls the facility \"the most environmentally studied and geologically surveyed site on the planet.\"  \"WCS went through the most rigorous licensing requirements ever imposed on a disposal facility of any kind,\" McDonald said.  \"With radioactive waste, you really want to make sure the person watching the waste is more permanent than companies are.\"  According to Reed, the staffers on the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality who resigned were concerned about more than just water contamination. \"We had a couple people resign or retire from the commission and come to us and say, 'Look, we think there was political pressure to get this license done, and all the t's weren't crossed,'\" he said, adding that Simmons' past contributions to Perry raised red flags. \"Harold Simmons certainly was supportive of the governor who then signed into law important bills for his industry,\" he said.  In an interview with Mother Jones, a Perry spokesman declined to answer questions about the WCS license process but said Perry has no ties to the company beyond Simmons' campaign contributions.  Reed's group sued WCS over its disposal facility due to the environmental concerns, but the Texas Supreme Court ultimately decided the group didn't have standing in the case.  More recently, Perry has supported the idea of storing more dangerous nuclear waste in Texas. In 2014, he sent a letter to the Texas lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house, in which he declared that \"it's time for Texas to act\" because states holding onto high-level radioactive waste have \"been betrayed by their federal government.\" Attached to the letter was a report that Perry had commissioned from the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality calling on the federal government to authorize \"centralized interim storage facilities\" for high-level nuclear waste. It also outlined how the Department of Energy could work with private companies to make that a reality.  As for WCS, the company argues that disposing of Texas' low-level nuclear waste for more than four years has made it a strong candidate to handle the federal government's waste, especially since so few companies are in this line of work. There would likely be little competition for the potential contract. Companies generally notify the NRC well in advance if they intend to apply for a license, and only one other company has issued such a notice.  WCS also contends that Texas' experience with privatized waste disposal makes Perry uniquely qualified to lead the Department of Energy.  \"Texas leadership from the governor on down has had experience addressing nuclear waste issues, and it's an experience that very few other states have had because no other state has successfully opened a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility,\" McDonald said. \"I think the fact that Governor Perry has working knowledge of the issue_will serve him well as the secretary of energy.\"  Even if Yucca Mountain eventually does move forward, permanent disposal is at least 20 years away, and interim storage would still be necessary, argues WCS.  Meanwhile, a coalition of anti-nuclear-energy groups has lined up against the creation of new interim storage sites and has written a letter to NRC opposing the company's application. Attorney Robert Eye, who represents some of the groups, worries these sites will become permanent places to put the waste because there will be \"very little pressure to move [it] to a permanent repository, even with the best intentions.\"  Reed, the Texas Sierra Club official, says his primary concern is that if something goes wrong and waste isn't properly stored, the government could ultimately end up dealing with an expensive cleanup.  \"Private companies_can easily go belly-up depending on short-term economic realities,\" Reed said. \"With radioactive waste, you really want to make sure the person watching the waste is more permanent than companies are. The real concern is companies walk away from things, and then other people are left holding the bag.\"", "date": "2017/01/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/department-energy-rick-perry-nuclear-waste", "title": "Will Rick Perry Privatize America's Nuclear Waste Storage?"}, {"text": "There were no demonstrations or outbursts from protesters at Elaine Chao's confirmation hearing Wednesday to become President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of transportation. The former secretary of labor in the second Bush administration may have not been loved by labor unions, but her previous experience as a deputy transportation secretary for George H.W. Bush makes her uniquely qualified for the job.  The most notable moments during Chao's appearance before the Senate Science, Commerce, and Transportation Committee did not concern her positions on safety regulation, Trump's infrastructure plan, or the self-driving car industry, but rather her marriage to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell appeared at the hearing to introduce his wife.  \"I regret that I have but one wife to give for my country's infrastructure,\" McConnell said, echoing the words of the former Senate majority leader Bob Dole in 1983, when he introduced his wife, Elizabeth Dole, for her confirmation hearing to be secretary of transportation in the Reagan administration. \"She's got really great judgment,\" McConnell added, pausing for effect and appreciative laughter from his colleagues, \"on a whole variety of things.\"  McConnell's quip was the first of a number of remarks focusing on Chao's gender and marital status that male senators made during the hearing. Sen. Jim Inhoffe (R-Okla.) focused on Chao's relationship to her father. \"I keep thinkinglast night, I was with you and your family, your daddyhow excited your daddy is right now thinking about the things that are going on, and that he is responsible for you and your performing and your cute little nieces,\" he said at the start of his questioning. \"As you well know, I've got 20 kids and grandkids. You've got some more work to do, but that's alright.\"  The comments were decidedly bipartisan. \"I might just say although Sen. McConnell has left, he and I have something in common, which is we both married above ourselves,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) joked. He wasn't the only one to say something to that effect.  \"I have a great deal of respect for you, although now I have some frustration now with Mitch McConnell, being a young, single member of the Senate,\" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said. \"He has never taken me aside to tell me how to marry out of my league.\"  At the start of the confirmation hearing, chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) patted his committee on the back, noting that with its new members, it has the distinction of being the \"Senate committee with the most women members ever.\"  For her part, Chao played along. She joked about her relationship with McConnell, saying she planned to \"lock in the majority leader's support tonight over dinner.\"  Chao is not alone. As the wife of a Republican leader, she has plenty of company.", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/sexist-remarks-senators-during-elaine-chaos-confirmation-hearing", "title": "The Sexist Chatter at Elaine Chao's Confirmation Hearing Will Make You Shudder"}, {"text": "On the first day of the new Congress, House Republicans have created a new rule in which House members could be fined up to $2,500 for live-streaming from the House floor, taking still photos, and recording audio and video. The rule is largely seen as a response to the sit-in Democrats held last year to pressure Republicans to hold a vote on gun control legislation, which they live-streamed from their phones once the official cameras were shut off.  AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for the Republican House leadership, told Mother Jones the move is an effort to \"ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people's work.\"  But good-government advocates are criticizing the measure, saying it's bad for government transparency. \"It could have a chilling effect on some members of Congress who might otherwise be inclined to depict something that's going on in the floor of the House through electronic means,\" says Michael MacLeod-Ball, chief of staff for the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington Legislative Office. A rule prohibiting the use of taking pictures as well as audio and video recordings on the House floor is already in place, he notes, but the new rule adds teeth to it by way of a fine.  In a passionate speech urging the House to reject the rule, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon who led the sit-in last summer, asserted that fines won't keep him from his duty to speak out if the House of Representatives is not reflecting the will of the American people. \"We have a right to dissent,\" he said. \"We have the right to protest for what is right. Regardless of rule or no rule, we cannot and will not be silenced.\"  Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) described the move as an \"unconstitutional gag rule\" in a statement released late last month when the fine was first proposed. They called it \"unprecedented,\" arguing the rule \"clearly is intended to undermine the rights of Members in the Minority to freely express their views on the House floor, which is a critical means by which Members communicate to the American public.\"  \"It is particularly egregious that such a controversial and potentially unlawful change is being implemented in the complete absence of hearings or input from legal experts, let alone the Minority,\" they concluded.  Mother Jones reached out to Facebook, Periscope, and YouTube for their take on the live-streaming rule, but none of the platforms offered any comment.  Last night, in an apparent response to criticism, Republicans changed their initial proposal in order to allow lawmakers to appeal the fine to the House Ethics Committee. MacLeod-Ball of the ACLU says he's still not convinced the rule would stand up to legal scrutiny because of the speech-and-debate clause in the Constitution, which protects lawmakers if they're fulfilling their legislative responsibilities to their constituents. Even if the rule is technically legal, MacLeod-Ball argues lawmakers should get rid of it.  \"The restriction is in place and for no apparent good reason,\" he says. \"It will tend to restrict the amount of information the public gets about the way government operates.\"", "date": "2017/01/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/house-republicans-are-preemptively-trying-silence-dissent-democrats", "title": "It's 2017 and the House GOP Wants to Ban Live Video"}, {"text": "Good evening!

Southwest urges the Department to grant all U.S. carrier requests in full before allocating any MEX slots to Mexican carriers.

Neither Trump or RFK Jr live in the world that actually exists so who the hell knows what's going on. Vaccinate your kids.  Update 2: 1:45pm Thursday 1/12/2017: Unnwayed by Hope Hick's denial, Robert Kennedy Jr told his environmental group Wednesday that he expects to take a leave of absence to work on Trump's bullshit vaccinations commission.

In 2015, OneWest Bank moved to foreclose on John Yang, an 80-year-old Korean immigrant living in Orange Park, Florida, a small suburb of Jacksonville. The bank believed he wasn't living in his home, violating the terms of its loan. It dispatched an agent to give him legal notification of the foreclosure.  Where did the bank find him? At the same single-story home the bank had said in court papers he did not occupy.  Still OneWest pressed on, forcing Yang, a former Christian missionary, to seek help from legal aid attorneys. This year, during a deposition, an employee of OneWest's servicing division was asked the obvious question: Why would the bank pursue a foreclosure that seemed so clearly unjustified by the facts?  In recent years, OneWest has foreclosed on at least 50,000 people, often in circumstances that consumer advocates say run counter to federal rules and common sense.  The employee's response was blunt: \"You're trying to make logic out of an illogical situation.\"  Yang was lucky. The bank eventually dropped its efforts against him. But others were not so fortunate. In recent years, OneWest has foreclosed on at least 50,000 people, often in circumstances that consumer advocates say run counter to federal rules and, as in Yang's case, common sense.  President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary has prompted new scrutiny of OneWest's foreclosure practices. Mnuchin was the lead investor and chairman of the company during the years it ramped up its foreclosure efforts. Representatives from the company and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Records show the attempt to push Mr. Yang out of his home was not an unusual one for OneWest's Financial Freedom unit, which focused on controversial home loans known as reverse mortgages. Regulators and consumer advocates have long worried that these loans, popular during the height of the housing bubble, exploit elderly homeowners.  The loans allow people to benefit from the equity they have built up over many years without selling their houses. The money is paid in a variety of ways, from lump sums to a stream of monthly checks. Borrowers are allowed to stay in their homes for as long as they live.  The loans are guaranteed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, meaning the agency pays lenders like Freedom Financial the difference between the ultimate sale price of the home and the size of the reverse mortgage.  But the fees are often high and the interest charges mount up quickly because the homeowner isn't paying down any of the principal on the loan. Homeowners remain on the hook for property taxes and insurance and can lose their homes if they miss those payments.  A 2012 report to Congress by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said \"vigorous enforcement is necessary to ensure that older homeowners are not defrauded of a lifetime of home equity.\"  ProPublica found numerous examples where Financial Freedom had foreclosed for legally questionable reasons. The company served several other homeowners at their homes to let them know they were being sued for not occupying their homes. In Florida, a shortfall of only $0.27 led to a foreclosure attempt. In Atlanta, the company sought to foreclose on a widow after her husband's death but backed down when a legal aid attorney sued, citing federal law that allowed the surviving spouse to remain in the home.  \"It appears their business approach is scorched earth, in a way that doesn't serve communities, homeowners or the taxpayer,\" said Alys Cohen, a staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center in Washington, DC.  Since the financial crisis, OneWest, through Financial Freedom, has conducted a disproportionate number of the nation's reverse mortgage foreclosures. It was responsible for 16,200 foreclosures on government-backed reverse mortgages, or 39 percent of all foreclosures nationwide, from 2009 through late 2014, even though it only serviced about 17 percent of the loans, according to government data analyzed by the California Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group for low-income consumers. While some foreclosures were justified, legal aid attorneys say Financial Freedom has refused to work with borrowers in foreclosure to establish payment plans, in contrast with other servicers of reverse mortgages.  About three-quarters of homeowners who sought a modification from OneWest through the program were denied, according to the latest figures from the Treasury Department.  Experts say the companies are not entirely to blame for the wave of foreclosures. HUD oversees standards on most reverse mortgages. In the years after the housing crash, HUD's rules evolved, creating a miasma of confusion for mortgage servicers. Companies say the new federal rules required them to foreclose when borrowers fell far behind on property and insurance costs, rather than work out payment plans.  OneWest's rough treatment of homeowners extended to its behavior toward borrowers with standard mortgages in the aftermath of the housing crash. In 2009, the Obama administration launched a program to encourage mortgage servicers to work out affordable mortgage modifications with borrowers. OneWest, weighed down by several hundred thousand souring mortgages, signed up.  It didn't go well. About three-quarters of homeowners who sought a modification from OneWest through the program were denied, according to the latest figures from the Treasury Department. OneWest was among the worst-performing large servicers in the program by that measure. In 2011, activists protested OneWest's indifference at Mnuchin's Bel Air mansion in Los Angeles.  \"We're in a difficult economic environment and very sympathetic to the problems many homeowners face, but under the government's program there's not a solution in every case,\" Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal that year.  Despite the controversy, Mnuchin and the other investors in OneWest made a killing on their purchase. In 2009, Mnuchin's investment group bought the failed mortgage bank IndyMac, which had been taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the financial crisis, changing the name to OneWest. They paid about $1.5 billion, with the FDIC sharing the ongoing mortgage losses. George Soros, a Clinton backer at whose hedge fund Mnuchin had worked, and John Paulson, a hedge fund manager who also supported Trump, invested alongside Mnuchin in IndyMac.  In 2015, CIT, a lender to small- and medium-sized businesses, bought OneWest for $3.4 billion, more than doubling the Mnuchin group's initial investment. Mnuchin personally made about $380 million on the sale, according to Bloomberg estimates. He retains around a 1 percent stake in CIT, worth about $100 million, which he may have to divest if confirmed.  CIT has found the reverse mortgage business to be a headache. Recently, CIT took a $230 million pretax charge after it discovered that OneWest had mistakenly charged the government for payments that the company should have shouldered itself. An investigation of Financial Freedom's practices by HUD's inspector general is ongoing.  Yang's lawyers at Jacksonville Area Legal Aid fought his foreclosure for a year. Though Yang had run a dry-cleaning business in Florida and roamed the world as a missionary, working in North Korea, China, and Afghanistan, the bank's torrent of paperwork had overwhelmed him. Yang didn't speak English well. OneWest claimed it had sent him forms to verify he was living at his home, but that he never sent them back.  Under HUD rules, OneWest was required to verify that each borrower continued to use the property as a principal residence. It is a condition of all the HUD-backed loans in order to help ensure the government subsidy goes to those who need it.  But Yang can be forgiven for thinking OneWest could not have doubted that he was still in his home. During the same period that OneWest was moving to foreclose on Yang for not living in his home, another arm of the bank regularly spoke and corresponded with him at his home about a delinquent insurance payment, according to court documents.  A Financial Freedom employee testified in the case that the department that handled delinquent insurance payments and the department that handled occupancy did not communicate with each other in those circumstances.", "date": "2017/01/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/trump-treasury-pick-foreclosure-practices-homeowners%20", "title": "Trump's Treasury Pick Excelled at Kicking Elderly People Out of Their Homes"}, {"text": "This story first appeared in ProPublica.  The Trump administration appears to be either ignoring or exempting top staffers from its own watered-down ethics rules.  As we have detailed, President Trump in January issued an order weakening Obama-era ethics policies, allowing lobbyists to work at agencies they had sought to influence. The Trump order did limit what lobbyists could do once they entered government, banning them from directly handling issues on which they had lobbied.  But the administration may not be even following that.  We've found three hires announced last week who, in fact, are working on the same issues on which they were registered lobbyists while in the private sector.  Consider Shahira Knight, President Trump's special assistant for tax and retirement policy.  Lobbying disclosures show that Knight lobbied the government on a host of retirement and tax issues for financial services giant Fidelity. In one case, she lobbied against a regulation requiring financial professionals to act in the best interests of their clients when it comes to retirement accounts such as 401(k)s. The regulation is strongly supported by consumer advocates and strongly opposed by Fidelity. Retirement savers lose billions of dollars a year because of conflicts of interest in the industry, the Obama administration estimated.  The Trump executive order says former lobbyists like Knight cannot work in the \"specific issue area\" in which they lobbied, though that phrase is not defined.  Given that Knight lobbied on tax and retirement issues and is now working as Trump's assistant on tax and retirement issues, how can she be in compliance with the ethics policy?  It's not at all clear.  One possibility is that the Trump administration has issued waivers exempting Knight and the other lobbyists they've hired from the new rules.  Unfortunately, there's no way for the public to know if this has been done. In a little-noticed action, Trump killed the Obama-era requirement that the Office of Government Ethics publish an annual report disclosing such waivers. Trump's order also removed the requirement to provide a public interest justification for waivers.  That means Trump can exempt an official from the lobbying limits at any time, for any reason, with no public disclosure.  Critics of the administration's approach to conflicts of interest said it is impossible to know whether the rules are being ignored or rendered irrelevant by the officials implementing them.  \"I very much suspect that Trump's ethics executive order either is not understood within the administration and not enforced, or the White House counsel is single-handedly interpreting the restrictions of the executive order so narrowly that they are next to meaningless,\" said Craig Holman of the watchdog group Public Citizen.  The White House didn't respond to a request for comment about whether any waivers have been issued or the how the ethics policy is being enforced.  Asked about Knight, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement:  \"Shahira Knight has been working with the Office of White House Counsel since before she joined the White House staff to ensure she is in compliance with all rules and regulations.\"  Walters wouldn't provide any further details.  The two other lobbyists hired last week, whose names were first flagged by The Intercept, are Michael Catanzaro and George David Banks. They, like Knight, were named to National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn's senior staff.  Just a few months ago Catanzaro was lobbying on fuel standards and greenhouse gas regulations for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. He is now special assistant to the president for domestic energy and environmental policy.  As for Banks, disclosure records state he recently lobbied on environmental issues for a business group. He is now special assistant to the president for international energy and environment.  In an interview, Banks told ProPublica that he had signed an ethics pledge but no one from the White House Counsel's office has contacted him about any restrictions on his job or the fact that he was a registered lobbyist.  \"I haven't had a conversation about it yet,\" he said. He has not received a waiver.  Banks also said that he was mistakenly registered as a lobbyist due to an error by his office manager. His former employer, the American Council for Capital Formation, said in a statement that Banks \"did not meet the legal threshold for registering with Congress as a lobbyist\" and it is seeking to correct the filings.  That distinction matters because the Trump ethics policy applies only to officials who were registered lobbyists.  The law requires a lobbyist to register based on a complicated test including spending more than 20 percent of his or her time lobbying. In recent years there has been a well-documented decline in the ranks of registered lobbyists, who must report details of their work publicly, and a rise in so-called shadow lobbying by people who do not meet the registration requirements.  The White House spokeswoman said that Knight and Catanzaro \"have been working with the Office of White House Counsel since before they joined the White House staff to ensure they are in compliance with all rules and regulations,\" but declined to provide any details.  There are multiple signs the Trump administration is not aggressively policing ethics issues beyond its handling of the rules on lobbyists. In January, Trump's team cancelled a previously scheduled ethics and leadership training course for White House appointees, Politico reported. The White House Counsel's office also gave a pass to Trump aide Kellyanne Conway for violating ethics rules by urging Americans to buy Ivanka Trump's clothing line.  During the Obama administration, the White House posted copies of ethics waivers on its website. Obama issued a handful to former lobbyists during his eight years in office.  The current White House website still has a page for ethics waivers, but it is empty. It states: \"Ethics pledge waivers will be published as they become available.\"", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/how-trump-administration-may-be-skirting-its-own-ethics-rules", "title": "How the Trump Administration May Be Skirting Its Own Ethics Rules"}, {"text": "This story first appeared in ProPublica.  Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and the heir to a family real estate empire, has emerged as perhaps Donald Trump's closest adviser. A near-constant presence by Trump's side, his portfolio includes business, tax, political, and foreign policy matters.  Last month his lawyers outlined a plan under which they said Kushner would avoid any possibility that his White House work would overlap with his business interests.  The plan didn't have much detail. But newly released documents and statements from the White House are making the picture clearer: Kushner is keeping parts of his family business.  Kushner retains some real estate holdings associated with Kushner Companies, a White House spokesperson said in an email.  Kushner has divested ownership of a number of Kushner Companies businesses and one large Manhattan office building, the White House spokesperson said. But the White House and a Kushner Companies spokesman declined to say what Kushner is keeping and what he has given up.  Kushner's decision to keep some of his business, ethics lawyers say, raises questions about how he will recuse himself from government matters that could affect his own bank account.  Kushner Companies has also had relationships with a number of large financial firms such as Goldman Sachs that will likely be affected by Trump administration policies.  \"What mechanism will the White House use to ensure that Kushner will not participate in matters that affect his retained financial interests?\" asked Kathleen Clark, an ethics law expert and professor at Washington University School of Law. \"We, the public, should have information about what types of matters Kushner is going to have to recuse from.  Given the sprawling and complicated nature of the Kushner family business, the issue is not academic.  The New York Times recently explored Kushner Companies' dealings with a Chinese firm that has ties to that country's government. Kushner Companies has also had relationships with a number of large financial firms such as Goldman Sachs that will likely be affected by Trump administration policies.  Kushner Companies' real estate holdings are intertwined with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that may face an overhaul during the Trump administration, as Bloomberg recently reported.  Asked about Kushner's plan to avoid conflicts, White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not offer any specific areas that he will recuse himself from. She said in an email:  \"Like other government employees, Mr. Kushner will recuse from particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his financial interests and will comply with financial disclosure requirements.  Here's why recusals are needed and how they work  Kushner was hired as an executive branch employee, so he must comply with the law that makes it a crime for an official to work on a government matter that will affect his financial interests. (As president, Donald Trump is, famously, exempt from that law.)  People entering the government have two primary ways of resolving conflicts: selling off the assets that may pose a conflict, or keeping ownership and recusing themselves from government matters that could affect the holdings.  For officials like Kushner who hold onto assets, there is usually a memo outlining areas of recusal, ethics lawyers say. Sometimes there is a screening process so the official isn't invited to, say, a meeting on a matter that would affect their holdings.  \"There would likely be some written documentation of at least the overall understanding of the kinds of matters in which an individual White House official would not participate,\" said ethics specialist Robert Walker of law firm Wiley Rein, speaking of the general practice, not about Kushner specifically.  For Kushner, the White House Counsel's Office will be in charge of monitoring compliance with the conflict of interest law and, in case of any violations, making a criminal referral. High-profile prosecutions under the law are rare but not unheard of. A Bush-era Food and Drug Administration commissioner pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges stemming from his ownership of stocks in companies regulated by the agency.  Among its best-known holdings are 666 Fifth Avenue, a Manhattan office tower purchased for $1.8 billion in 2007 and the former Jehovah's Witness Watchtower headquarters on the Brooklyn waterfront.  Trump's White House Counsel is Don McGahn, an attorney best known for his deregulatory fervor during his stint as Federal Election Commissioner. \"The multiple ethics problems swirling around the White House are squarely McGahn's responsibility,\" wrote Harvard Law professor and former Bush Administration official Jack Goldsmith in a blog post last week.  Here's what we now know about the state of Kushner's business holdings  While the White House would only say that Kushner retains some real estate holdings, Kushner does have to file a financial disclosure form that will give more details about what he owns. The filing should be made public in the coming weeks or months. That filing may also shed light on what assets Kushner divested in the preceding year.  Kushner Companies is privately held so the full extent of the business is not clear. The company says it owns or manages 20,000 apartments and 13 million square feet of office and retail space in six states.  Among its best-known holdings are 666 Fifth Avenue, a Manhattan office tower purchased for $1.8 billion in 2007; the former Jehovah's Witness Watchtower headquarters on the Brooklyn waterfront; and the building in midtown Manhattan that used to house The New York Times.  Kushner has divested from 666 Fifth Avenue, according to both the White House and Kushner Companies spokesman James Yolles.  \"He has also divested from numerous Kushner Companies businesses and has no role in the management or operations of Kushner Companies,\" Yolles said in an email.  Neither Yolles nor the White House would provide more details.  Kushner has also stepped down as chief executive of the family company.  The new documents, from the Office of Government Ethics, show that Kushner has sold his interest in seven entities, some of which are associated with Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm run by his brother, Joshua. (Thrive has investments in Oscar, the health insurance company.)  Last month, Kushner's attorneys told reporters that he would divest from 35 investments. It's not clear whether all of those divestitures have been made or what the remaining investments are.  Kushner's attorneys said that some of those assets would be sold to Kushner's brother and a trust controlled by his mother. That arrangement raised the eyebrows of some ethics experts, with one describing it as a \"shell game.  Under the conflict of interest law, government employees must also avoid conflicts that could arise from their spouse's assets. Kushner's attorneys previously said that his wife, Ivanka Trump, would divest some assets. But again the details are unclear.  Government ethics office documents show Ivanka Trump divested shares in a handful of securities. But it's not clear if Ivanka Trump has sold other holdings, such as her stake in the Trump Organization's hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C. That hotel is run under a lease with the federal government, which could create another conflict for Kushner.  The Office of Government Ethics warned Kushner's attorneys about the unpredictability of ethics issues, according to heavily redacted email exchanges, which were first reported by MSNBC.  \"Ethics issues arise unexpectedly, and they don't come with the label Caution! I'm an ethics issue,'\" wrote agency director Walter Shaub, continuing:  \"White House appointees are at the mercy of the attention span of a White House Counsel's office with a thousand other things to do. As things are currently shaping up, it's not clear that this new White House will have a fully functioning ethics office of its own on the first day. For that reason, caution is advisable. The further you can put [Kushner] back from the line, the better you will protect him.\"  Derek Kravitz contributed to this report.", "date": "2017/03/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/white-house-power-player-jared-kushner-keeping-parts-his-real-estate-empire", "title": "Keeping With Family Tradition, Jared Kushner Won't Cut His Business Ties"}, {"text": "By now many have seen the video of an unidentified man punching white nationalist Richard Spencer in the face during inauguration weekend. Much in the way that the new president's vicious campaign rhetoric gave voice to the deeper resentments of some of his supporters, the assault on Spencer seems to have offered a cathartic and even comedic outlet for those on the left who were angered by thoughts of Trumpians goose-stepping through the streets of DC as Trump entered the White House. Since the video emerged, social media users have set the footage to Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" and the Hamilton soundtrack, and comedian Tim Heidecker even wrote his own tune to celebrate the bashing. Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted, \"I don't care how many songs you set Richard Spencer being punched to, I'll laugh at every one.\" Journalists for the New York Times and other major outlets were soon mulling over the question at hand: \"Is it OK to punch a Nazi?\" A website, isitokaytopunchanazi.com, answered with a gleeful loop of the attack, with one neon-yellow word superimposed atop it: \"Yes.\"  Yet, this was more than just a morbid social-media sideshow: The attack on Spencer is part of a perennial conflict that may again be escalating. For decades, far-right extremists have faced the militant wrath of \"antifas\" (short for anti-fascists). With Trump's campaign having summoned all sorts of white supremacists and other trolls from under their bridges, the old warwhich I first got a front-row glimpse into a decade agoappears ready to re-ignite.  This beef goes back to before World War II, when in Europe, a nascent authoritarian movement inspired by Hitler, Mussolini, and Francisco Franco squared off against a popular front coalition of liberals and radicals. At the Battle of Cable Street, in October 1936, Oswald Mosley brought 2,000 members of his British Union of Fascists to march through London's Jewish East End neighborhood and 100,000 anti-fascists showed up to oppose them. In the resulting melee, Jews, Irishmen, Communists, anarchists, and socialists beat Mosley's men with sticks, rocks, and sawed-off chair-legs. Local women dumped their chamber pots out of windows onto the heads of Mosley's men.  Similar conflicts played out several decades later in America. In 1979, in Greensboro, North Carolina, the Communist Workers Party organized a rally called \"Death to the Klan.\" TV crews filmed as a nine-car caravan of Klansmen and neo-Nazis suddenly showed up and shot at marchers, murdering five participants, though no one was ever convicted of the crime. (In 2014, one self-proclaimed participant, Frazier Glenn Miller, went on a shooting spree at a Jewish cultural center in Kansas, murdering three people. The 74-year-old had just been diagnosed with lung cancer; he said that he \"wanted to make damned sure I killed some Jews or attacked the Jews before I died.\")  In 1982, a street gang in Minneapolis named the Baldies began committing what they described as \"righteous violence\"a term apocryphally attributed to Henry David Thoreau to describe John Brown's attack at Harpers Ferryagainst neo-Nazis who had started to appear in the city. The Baldies and their opponents both adopted the fashion of British punksbomber jackets, bald heads, boots and bracesand kicked the Nazis, quite literally, out of town. On one occasion they even collaborated with now Congressman Keith Ellison, then a law student at the University of Minnesota, to lead a protest. \"I remember he and the rest of the [Black Law Student Association] were friendly with us,\" a founder of the Baldies told the Minneapolis City Pages. \"I think they were just intrigued because we were so young and because we were anti-racist skinheads, which was weird to them.\"  The battles in the Twin Cities were followed by a wider spread of neo-Nazi violence. In 1988, three members of a gang called White Aryan Resistance beat a 28-year-old Ethiopian student named Mulugata Serew to death in Portland, Oregon. In 1998, skinheads murdered Daniel Shearsty and Spit Newburn, a pair of anti-racists and best friends from Las Vegasone black, one a white Marinein the Nevada desert. The next year, a member of the racist cult World Church of the Creator went on a shooting spree in Indiana, gunning down nine Orthodox Jews, an African-American man, and a Korean graduate student before killing himself.  Anti-fascist groups like Anti-Racist Action, Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice, and the Love and Rage Anarchist Federation fought back. Their members advocated \"direct action\" against white supremacists, eschewing legislative efforts in favor of physically preventing Nazis from organizing, distributing literature, and speaking in public. To their supporters, these groups merged the moralism of America's abolitionist tradition with the nihilism of punk rock, and boiled the culture wars down to their most primal element: vicious brawls over racism, sexism, and homophobia. The logic of their direct action was that, if a white-supremacist leader inspired someone to commit a hate crime, police couldn't intervene until after a violent action had taken place. Anti-fascists wouldn't wait. \"Racism is an idea,\" one anonymous ARA member said in the 2000 documentary Invisible Revolution, but \"fascism is an idea mixed with action. It took fascism to establish Jim Crow and before that, slavery_.Anti-Semitism has been around a long time but it took fascism to [make] the Holocaust_.When you cross that threshold, you negate your rights to a calm, collective conversation.\"  Everyone laughed as Joe pantomimed his victory over the man by stomping the floor of the kitchen with his steel-toe combat boots: \"How does it feel to get your head kicked in by a faggot?\"  My own introduction to what anti-fascism looked like took place in South Philadelphia in 2004, where I attended a house party arranged around a half-keg of High Life in the kitchen. At the center of the gathered crew of mohawked kids was a man named Joe, whose skinny crimson suspenders strained over a swell of jiggling belly. A leader of ARA's Philadelphia chapter, Joe regaled us with a story about a stranger in a pub who'd once called him a faggot. \"So I grabbed this motherfucker by the collar,\" he said, \"and I dragged him outside.\" In the parking lot, Joe explained, he beat the man unconscious. The tale was horrific. But it was also surprisingbecause Joe was gay, it turned out, as were many of his Philly ARA comrades. He wasn't insulted by being called a faggot; he was insulted that someone would think there was anything wrong with being one.  \"How does it feel!\" Joe thundered, when he'd gotten to the climax of his yarn, in which he knocked his antagonist down and kicked him in the head repeatedly. Everyone laughed as Joe pantomimed his victory over the man by stomping the floor of the kitchen with his steel-toe combat boots: \"How does it feel to get your head kicked in by a faggot?\"  With the dawn of the Trump era, the Joes of the country may be stirring, and Spencer and his fans seem to sense it. On Tuesday, Spencer's supporters offered a $3,000 bounty to anyone who could identify the alt-right leader's assailant, and Spencer called for the formation of alt-right vigilante squads to prevent future attacks. \"The ANTIFA thug who violently assaulted Spencer hid his face behind a mask,\" an anonymous commenter said, \"but some think they caught a glimpse of his face. There's not much to go onbut let's identify the ANTIFA criminal who punched Richard Spencer.\"  Meanwhile, the same day that Spencer was assaulted, a 25-year-old anti-fascist was shot in the stomach during an inauguration protest at the University of Washington, allegedly by an alt-right sympathizer. New groups adopting an anti-fascist outlook such as Redneck Revolt, John Brown Militia, and the Bastards Motorcycle Club appear poised to revive the direct-action tactics of the 1980s and '90s in order to confront white supremacists emboldened by Trump. Anti-Racist Action's 20 or so chapters around the country have also promised to join the fray. The day after the inauguration, ARA's branch in Louisville, Kentucky, posted on their website:  For decades, [white supremacists] were the face of the enemy and only a minute few dared show their true colors in public. This made them easy to dismiss, easy to ignore...However, recent events have proven that the fascist ideology has not only survived but thrived_Now, their labors of hatred have been rewarded with a sympathetic President-Elect and a federal Congress that is, at best, indifferent to their evil. A warning to those who wish to destroy what we hold dear; We will resist you in the streets, in the poll booths and in the townhouses. Whether it's in the bars, the concert halls, the conference centers or even City Hall, we will not allow a platform for your dangerous and divisive ideas. We will not allow history to repeat itself. We will shut you down everywhere you go. We will block your marches. We will interrupt your speeches. We will protest your legislation. We will be the thorn in your side. The glass in your bread. The pain in your ass.  Trump's presidency is already promising to turn back the clock on American progress in multiple ways, with womens rights, racial justice, and environmental protections under siege. The return of the war between fascists and anti-fascists is another expression of our current political atavism. This time, given a uniquely pugilistic president of the United States, the battle may rage hotter than ever.", "date": "2017/01/26", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/video-richard-spencer-punch-antifa-fascism", "title": "The Long History of \"Nazi Punching\""}, {"text": "On a breezy, unusually warm morning in late October, about 60 cops, mental health counselors, pastors, and business leaders are gathered inside a community center in Newton, Kansas for an intensive training. They sit mostly stone-faced around folding tables with coffee and pastries as Dr. Russell Palarea launches into a close analysis of the 1999 cult comedy Office Space. He explains why the behavior of Milton Waddamsa memorably pathetic cubicle dweller who suffers multiple indignities at the hands of his coworkersholds the key to preventing a mass shooting.  Palarea cues a series of clips that show Milton muttering under his breath about a prized red Swingline stapler taken from him by his bullying boss. As the film progresses, Milton's socially awkward affect begins to turn more hostile. Eventually, he slinks into the boss's office to repossess the stapler. Palarea pauses the video to underscore the telling escalation: \"He's taken matters into his own hands. He's moved from idea to action.\" By the final clip, Milton has burned down the office building and decamped to a beach resort in Mexico, where he mumbles about slipping strychnine into the guacamole. The dark comedy cracks a couple of smiles, serving both as an icebreaker and an initial lesson on the behavioral warning signs of an attackan obsessive grievance, oblique threats about killing.  Palarea, a forensic psychologist based in Washington, D.C., is a leading practitioner of threat assessment, an emerging field in which mental health and law enforcement experts work together to identify and deter individuals who may be poised to commit violent attacks. At his invitation, I'd come to this rural, heavily Mennonite region about 30 miles north of Wichita to observe him train an unprecedented group: Virtually every person in the room was connected to the events of February 25, 2016, when a disturbed employee at the lawnmower plant in nearby Hesston went on a rampage, killing three people and wounding 14 others.  In today's era of active-shooter drills, leaders here in Harvey County didn't want to focus just on how to respond in the event of another attack; they wanted to understand what led to the rampage and do what they could to ensure that another one, however unlikely, wouldn't occur. They had learned about Palarea's work after reading a 2015 story I wrote about an innovative strategy to prevent mass shootings and flew him in to teach them the fundamentals of threat assessment. Palarea has been in the threat assessment field for more than two decades, consulting with teams for the military, federal agencies, colleges, and corporations. When working in these various settings, he told me, he's always emphasized the same theme: \"You need to worry about this happening here.\" But the theme in Harvey County was new: \"Let's heal from this and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"  I'd also come to Kansas to gain a deeper sense of the impact from the mass shooting, long after the news cameras were gone and the rest of America had moved on. Though the experience was still raw for many at the training, participants also expressed a sense of empowerment, in part because threat assessment defies the conventional wisdom that nothing can really be done to prevent mass shootings. \"As a clinician, when you are confronted with the fact that there might be harm or danger, it's isolating,\" Karla Roth, a mental health counselor, told me. \"To know that you can work together and not be alone in itthat's hopeful.\"  Roth was among a small team from Prairie View Hospital in Newton that had rushed to Hesston to help in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Initially, she didn't know the status of her husband and son-in-law, who both worked inside the Excel facility. \"It was horror. Then when I found out that they were OK, I just had to help,\" she said. \"This is a peaceful, quiet, want-to-live-in place. To have it happen here is something no one would have ever thought.\"    As the sun began to sink across the hayfields, Harvey County Sheriff Townsend \"T.\" Walton took me for a ride in his cruiser. He retraced a chaotic path that started around 5 p.m. that day. A burst of calls had come over the radio in the span of just a few minutesone, two, and then three shootings. Gun violence had been relatively rare in Walton's three decades of law enforcement in the regionand never anything like what he was hearing now. \"I'm my head I'm going, 'Is this terrorism?'\" he recalled. It was just two months after the massacre in San Bernardino, California. \"I'm not thinking, 'This is a guy who just got served a protection-from-abuse letter and he's flipped out.'\"  Thirty-eight-year-old Cedric Ford was a recent transplant to Newton who worked the paint line at Excel. He had a criminal record in Florida and had come to the attention of local authorities for beating up his girlfriend. About three hours before the attack, \"everything was totally normal\" and Ford seemed \"happy as all could be,\" remarked a coworker who'd chatted with him in the Excel parking lot. Soon afterwards, sheriff's deputies showed up at Excel to serve Ford with a protection order obtained by his girlfriend, apparently triggering his plan to go on a killing spree. Ford drove home, binged on meth and booze, and got back into his car with an AK-47 assault rifle and Glock handgun.  \"It's easy to just divide it into, 'Oh well, it's a gun problem' or 'It's a mental health problem. It's not. It is 12 problems, at least, that have to be addressed.\"  Walton slowed down just past the intersection of 12th Street and Meridian, where he'd reached Ford's first victims. Paramedics were rushing a middle-aged man with a blood-soaked shoulder out of a pickup truck strafed with bullet holes. The man's two grandchildren cowering in the rear of the cab were, amazingly, unharmed. Just up the road, Ford had slammed his car to a halt in the road in front of his next victim, a 74-year-old woman who refused his demand to relinquish her vehicle. Miraculously, she also survived unscathed, ducking into the passenger seat as Ford fired through the driver's side window. Ford succeeded in taking a truck from his third victim; the young man he shot in the leg along Old Highway 81 likely would have died if a sheriff's deputy hadn't arrived moments later with a tourniquet. (It is unclear why Ford went on the carjacking spree. His mental state was impaired and volatile, but he also may have been having trouble with his car.)      Walton was handling triage near 12th and Meridian when the radio erupted again: There was an active shooter inside Excel. Emergency dispatchers were quickly overwhelmed with nearly 50 calls from the plant. Walton immediately contacted his chief deputy: \"Get ahold of everybody we have and send them to Hesston.\"  As police vehicles and ambulances screamed toward the town, Hesston police chief Doug Schroeder had already reached Excel and found pandemonium. The large glass doors at the front of the plant had been shot out. Scores of employees were fleeing across the parking lots, some helping wounded coworkers. Schroeder didn't know who was shooting inside the mammoth facility, or where. But like most law enforcement leaders trained in the post-Columbine era, he knew he could not hesitate: An active shooter fires an average of every four seconds. And hundreds of people were still inside the building.  Schroeder entered through a side door, his Colt AR-15 rifle in hand. He saw blood trails on the floor both to the left and the right. It was quiet. He went right, toward the main entrance, and began to hear gunfire. He moved through several more hallways to an office area, where he encountered a frightened employee. As they began to speak, the glass window in the door next to them shattered. Ford was just on the other side. \"I'm going to get you,\" Schroeder recalled him saying.  Many employees were hiding in nearby offices, and Ford was carrying plenty more ammo.  The terrified employee bolted as the barrel of Ford's rifle poked through the doorway. Ford came through the door and chased after the employee, unaware that Schroeder was just behind him. Schroeder took aim with his rifle and fired four shots. As Ford spun and went down, he raised his pistol and fired at Schroeder. He missed. \"I saw the shell casings being ejected from the handgun, but I didn't hear the shots,\" Schroeder recalled.  Many employees were hiding in nearby offices and Ford was carrying plenty more ammo when he was killed. There is no way to know how many lives were saved by the 41-year-old police chief, who waved off a flurry of praise and said he didn't want his service to be defined by this one tragic event.  \"He's a humble man,\" Walton remarked as we pulled out of the Excel parking lot. \"But he was a hero to me, and without a doubt to the hundreds that got to go home that night.\"    Excel employs about a thousand people, and many in this sparsely populated region are connected to someone who works at the plant. I visited Subrina Luke, a big-hearted woman with a wide smile, at her small apartment near the Wichita airport. She recalled how she was feeling grumpy when her fiance Josh Higbee dropped her off at her job that morning: She was short on sleep and had forgotten her usual morning beverage, and she'd closed the car door without even saying goodbye. She was surprised when Higbee walked into the LensCrafters where she worked about 15 minutes later.  \"What are you doing here?\"  \"Just bringing you a drink.\"  \"You didn't have to do that,\" she said, cracking a grin.  \"Yes I did, woman. You would have been calling me for one.\"  He kissed her goodbye. They'd been together for almost two years, sharing an apartment and raising Higbee's spry four-year-old son from a prior relationship, who called Luke his mommy. A few hours later, the 31-year-old Higbee headed up the road to Excel. He mostly disliked his job as a welder on the second shift but was glad to be pulling in $23-plus an hour for his family.  The first call came from their four-year-old's babysitter, whose boyfriend also worked at Excel. \"There was a shooting at the job,\" she said. Luke's heart dropped, but the babysitter knew no details and Luke wouldn't be able to reach Higbee during his shift. She tried to focus on helping her customers. Her phone kept buzzing. During a break, she answered a call from one of Higbee's coworkers. \"I'm sorry,\" the woman told her, \"but Josh is gone.\"  \"I think I screamed so loud everyone in the mall heard me,\" Luke recalled, fighting through tears as we sat in her living room, sunlight jagging through the window blinds. Higbee's son, now five, was playing in the bedroom with a pastor who'd been helping Luke and the boy through the recovery process. The youngster seemed to be doing remarkably well, bounding over to me to show off a favorite toy and hugging Luke affectionately before going off to play while we talked.  \"When you have a five-year-old break down and cry that he misses his dad, that is the most heartbreaking thing you can ever experience.\"  Luke reflected on being robbed of her partner, and the boy of his father. \"He's not going to get to see him graduate high school, he's not going to even get to see him on his first day of school,\" she said. \"That's what hurts the most, is what his dad is going to miss and what he's going to miss.\" She recalled when the boy grasped that Higbee wasn't coming home again. \"When you have a five-year-old break down and cry that he misses his dad, that is the most heartbreaking thing you can ever experience,\" she said. \"I picked him up and I said, 'I miss him too, and I'm here for you when you need me.'\"  Luke struggled to recount her experience but said she was compelled to share it. People needed to know about who gets left behind and what they face, she said.  \"They should have psychological evaluations on everyone that owns a gun,\" she continued. \"I know that sounds crazy, but they have a way of telling people who are sane and not sane by things that they say. Not everyone should have a gun.\"    Why did the shooter do it? And could he have been stopped?  Those twin questions haunt the survivors of every mass shooting, and they are always difficult to answer. Several hours into the threat assessment training, Palarea asked the community leaders whether they were comfortable discussing their own recent case. He'd confided to me over dinner the night before that he wasn't sure he should even go there, given how fresh the attack still was. And there likely wouldn't be any satisfying answers to those core questions. Nonetheless, the group agreed to proceed. The discussion was brief and somewhat circumspect (and not for public disclosure), but it underscored behaviors and circumstances to watch out fordomestic violence, drug abuse, menacing commentsand how to communicate more effectively among local agencies and institutions about individuals of concern.  With the encouragement of event organizers, Palarea also decided that he would not leave out his most graphic training material. Ford's attack was the latest in a long history of similar workplace violence. Palarea gave an in-depth analysis of a 1988 case in Sunnyvale, California, where Richard Farley went on a rampage at the technology company ESL Incorporated, killing seven coworkers and wounding four others. One of the survivors, Laura Black, had rejected Farley's romantic advances; after he continued harassing her and turned abusive, ESL fired him. This was another case where a restraining order appeared to have triggered the plan for an attack: The day before the order obtained by Black was to go into effect, Farley struck.  The video showed Ford firing an AK-47 into an empty field. Was it just a guy harmlessly blowing off some steam, or something more ominous?  Palarea highlighted how ESL's termination of Farley had obviously turned out to be an inadequate solution to the threatand may have worsened it. He showed a clip of an interview conducted with Farley after he was taken into custody. Once ESL had fired him, Farley stated coldly to investigators, \"They lost control of me.\" Punitive measures may well be necessary in response to aberrant behavior, Palarea explained, but understanding and dealing with the root grievance remains crucial.  A few months before the rampage at Excel, Ford had posted a video on Facebook: The footage showed him standing at the side of a road, firing dozens of rounds from an AK-47 into an empty field. Was it just a guy harmlessly blowing off some steam, or something more ominous?  Perhaps a threat assessment team could have gained insight into Ford's mental state and motivations. \"It's a matter of the community keeping eyes and ears open for concerns,\" Palarea explains, \"and reporting those concerns to authorities, whether school administrators, workplace threat assessment teams, or the police.\" Once a tip comes in, a local threat assessment team scrutinizes the subject's behavior and circumstances for signs that person could be contemplating an attack. Indicators can include the acquisition of weapons, surveillance of a target, or communicating threats about intended victims, whether directly or indirectly (as is more commonly the case). \"Once we get a heads up, we can intervene,\" says Palarea. \"We can get the person mental health treatment if it's appropriate. We can help the person resolve conflict in a positive way instead of using violence as a solution to the problem. We can get the people the help they need, to prevent these things from happening.\"  Misty Elder-Serene, a director at Prairie View Hospital who arranged the training, told me that the community's interest in threat assessment stemmed in part from its social ethics: Though rural Kansas is gun country, the heavily Mennonite region is also marked by a culture of pacifism and commitment to social justice, she said. Those crosscurrents prompted some interesting conversations after the mass shootingnot so much a debate about gun violence as a discussion about \"how can we heal, and how can we be safe.\" The concept of threat assessment resonated with its imperative to better understand and manage people who could turn dangerous.  \"It's easy to just divide it into, 'Oh well, it's a gun problem' or 'It's a mental health problem,'\" remarked Dr. Mary Carman, a VP of psychological services at Prairie View. \"It's not. It is 12 problems, at least, that have to be addressed.\"  \"Some of this can be prevented. Let's not just sit here and do nothing.\"  Some in the community expressed a striking degree of compassion for the killer. At a church in Hesston on the Sunday evening after the attack, the service included four candles: three for those murdered, and a fourth for Ford. One person who was wounded, speaking to a reporter from his hospital bed, talked about seeing the look in Ford's eyes and understanding how much pain he was in.  Several leaders at the training expressed the hope that their response to the tragedy might serve as a model for other communities upended by mass shootings. Carman, who has worked in mental health for more than three decades, noted that Prairie View Hospital was founded by World War II-era conscientious objectors who'd served in so-called insane asylums, where people with mental health issues were often treated brutally. The hospital's founders felt there had to be a more humane and effective way to deal with disruptive, troubled people.  \"I think that passion still permeates the [local] culture,\" Carman told me. Ford's attack was shocking, \"but we can do something. We can learn more about it. We can help teach others. Some of this can be prevented. Let's not just sit here and do nothing.\"", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/mass-shooting-hesston-kansas-threat-assessment", "title": "One Small Town's Plan to Prevent Another Mass Shooting"}, {"text": "Right-wing extremists who carried out a deadly gun rampage in June 2014.  On Monday, in a case little noticed by the national media, a man went on trial in federal court for plotting a potentially horrific terrorist attack in upstate New York. In 2015, this man allegedly planned to enlist accomplices to help him bomb a house of worship and open fire with assault rifles on any bystanders. \"High casualty rates\" was the goal. \"If it gets down to the machete, we will cut them to shreds,\" he allegedly said, according to prosecutors.  Also on Monday, the Trump White House released a list of 78 attacks carried out in the US and abroad by \"radical Islamic terrorists\" since 2014, which it said were mostly \"underreported,\" following the president's own claim earlier in the day that the media conspired to ignore such attacks. But had the upstate New York plotter succeeded, he would not have made the White House list. The individual charged with masterminding that plan was Robert Doggart, a 65-year-old white man from Tennessee who allegedly conspired to form a militia and attack a Muslim community in Islamberg, NY, on \"behalf of American patriotism.\"  As the media picks apart the White House's absurd suggestion that attacks in Paris, San Bernardino, Orlando, and elsewhere were somehow ignored, the bigger story may be this: Trump has been almost entirely silent about terror plotted and carried out by white supremacists and other far-right extremists.  After six people were killed and many others were injured while praying at a mosque in Quebec City on January 29, the White House and Fox News quickly ran with false claims that the suspected attacker was Moroccan. (That man was in fact interviewed as a witness.) Trump has not tweeted nor made any public remarks about the white nationalist (and Trump fan) who has been charged in the case.  After avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine people at a historic black church in Charleston in June 2015, Trump tweeted that the attack was \"incomprehensible\" and expressed his \"deepest condolences to all.\" But despite frequently warning about the dangers of violent extremism, Trump has said nothing publicly about the case at any point since Roof went on trial in December.  After a white man went on a deadly rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in November 2015apparently motivated by an infamous video sting that falsely claimed Planned Parenthood was trafficking in \"baby parts\"Trump described the perpetrator as a \"maniac.\" But after that, he went on at much greater length about Planned Parenthood's alleged misdeeds.  And why has Trump mentioned nothing about a deadly shooting spree in 2014 by a longtime neo-Nazi at a Jewish community center and retirement home in Kansas? Or about the slaying of police officers in Las Vegas that year by right-wing extremists who left a swastika and a \"Don't tread on me\" flag on the officers' bodies? Or about the \"sovereign citizen\" charged in the shooting of five Black Lives Matter protesters last November?  It's hard to say. But there seems little reason to expect a list of attacks on Muslims, Jews, African Americans and others from the president anytime soon.", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/terror-attacks-trump-wont-talk-about-white-supremacists", "title": "The Terror Attacks Trump Won't Talk About"}, {"text": "Fox News has retracted and apologized for three tweets misidentifying the suspect in the massacre at a Quebec City mosque on Sunday night as a Moroccan.

Although Fox News updated its story with that information on Monday, the network's erroneous tweets remained online, pointing to a person identified by authorities as Mohamed el Khadir as the perpetrator. In fact, the sole suspect in the attack was 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, who was reported to be a right-wing extremist and vocal supporter of Donald Trump.

Two of the Fox News tweets highlighting the unconfirmed identity of the shooter as a Moroccan were posted on its primary account, which has 13 million followers, and remained online for more than a day. A third tweet, posted on anchor Bret Baier's Twitter feed for his show \"Special Report,\" was removed on Wednesday morning. It had circulated widely since Monday, after being retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. (See all three tweets here.)  On his show Monday night, Baier appeared to remain focused on the shooting suspect as a Moroccaneven after his own correspondent reported otherwise on the air.  \"Bret, in the aftermath of this attack there was a great deal of confusion and contradictory reports,\" said Fox correspondent David Lee Miller, reporting from Quebec City. \"Initially it was said that there were two shooters. Now authorities are saying there was only one, and just a short time ago the suspect was brought into court. He is identified as Alexandre Bissonnette.\" Miller described Bissonnette's age and the murder charges brought against him. Then he added: \"We are told he had been a student at a local university here, and that he had what are described as extreme right-wing views.\"  Miller also went on to say that the mosque had previously faced anti-Muslim harassment, including reports of it being vandalized with swastikas and the delivery of a pig's head to the building last summer.  After Miller's reporting of all these details, Baier responded:  \"And just to be clear, David Lee, one of them is Moroccan? Do we know anything more about the background?\"  Miller again emphasized that el Khadir had by then been identified as a witness to the shooting, not a suspect: \"The man described as the Moroccan was someone who was worshiping inside the mosque when the gunfire erupted.\"  \"OK, that's a good point to make,\" said Baier.

Editor's note: A day after this report, the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called for Fox News to correct the erroneous tweets. Fox News has since retracted and apologized for them; see the update below.  Late Monday, Canadian authorities charged Alexandre Bissonnette, a white 27-year-old university student, with multiple counts of murder for an attack on a mosque in Quebec City that left six dead and many others injured. According to a report in the Globe and Mail, the 27-year-old Bissonnette \"was known in the city's activist circles as a right-wing troll who frequently took anti-foreigner and anti-feminist positions and stood up for U.S. President Donald Trump.\" He also reportedly became a fan of far-right French leader Marine Le Pen after she visited Quebec City last March; a childhood friend and fellow student told the Globe and Mail that Bissonnette had become a xenophobe and was \"enthralled\" by racist nationalism.  With every mass shooting, the initial news is almost always riddled with inaccuraciesmisidentification is common, and rarely is there more than one attacker. By now this is very well-known in newsrooms. Earlier on Monday, an additional suspect was reportedly in custody: a man of Moroccan origin. Sure enough, Quebec officials soon clarified that this second person was considered a witness, not a suspect in the attack. But the toothpaste was already out of the tube with Fox News, which had pushed the story in a particular direction:  The Fox story was updated to clarify that Bissonnette was the only suspect, but the above Fox tweets remain in circulation as of this post.  Meanwhile, White House press secretary Sean Spicer offered an eyebrow-raising take on the attack, seeming to cite it as further justification for President Trump's crackdown on refugees and immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. Spicer first noted that in a call on Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump had agreed that the motive remained unclear, and had condemned the attack \"in the strongest possible terms.\" But then Spicer continued with this statement: \"It's a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation's safety and security.\"  The alleged far-right extremist who attacked the mosque had not yet quite come into view. But with the chaotic fallout from Trump's immigration order still dominating headlines around the world and the White House under a storm of criticism, it would be hard to interpret Spicer's comments as unrelated to the population newly barred from entering the United States.

Trump has called his plan, which he will officially unveil tonight at a speech before Congress, \"a landmark event, a message to the world, in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve.\"  Trump campaigned on a promise to increase the Pentagon's budget and reverse the Obama administration's alleged \"hollowing out\" of the military. Yet a look at the numbers shows that while military spending has been decreasing due to bipartisan budget caps and the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Defense Department is still getting more money than it has at any time since the end of World War II. Its 2016 budget was more than $600 billion. In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War, it was $569 billion (in current dollars).  And while Trump says increased military spending will reassert America's strength, the United States already is the world's 800-pound gorilla. In 2015, it was responsible for more than one third of all military spending on the planet. China and Russia, the United States' main military competitors, don't even come close.  Trump's budget plans also feature drastic cuts to international and environmental spending. He's reportedly pushing for a 24 percent cut to the EPA budget and a 37 percent cut to the State Department and USAID budget. While such reductions would have profound effects on these agencies, they are a drop in the bucket compared with the Pentagon budget. In 2016, the Department of State and USAID received an estimated $50.6 billion, or 1.3 percent of all federal spending. The EPA received $8.3 billion, or 0.2 percent of all federal spending. Meanwhile, the Pentagon got 15 percent.  While $54 billion would represent a more than 10 percent increase in the base military budget (which doesn't include the extra money it receives for overseas operations), it's massive compared to what the federal government spends on many social, science, environmental, and cultural programssome of which could be on the chopping block. The Trump administration has reportedly been eyeing the National Endowment of the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for elimination and privatization, respectively. The combined budgets of those two agencies was $593 million in 2016or 0.98 percent of all defense spending.  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's books are such a mess that it has never been audited, and the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly (though politely) criticized it for its \"long-standing financial management deficiencies.\" Even as Trump talks about shaking things up in Washington, DC, his budget plans reveal that he won't challenge a costly budgetary tradition: giving the Pentagon a pass.

The president considers his personal brand to be one of his biggest assetsvalued at $3.3 billion, in his own estimation. (Forbes, which has spent years reporting how Trump inflates his net worth, says the actual value is intangible.) Trump and his companies have registered hundreds of trademarks with his name in them, from The Donald to The Trump Follies. Never in American history has there been a president more concerned with controlling his image, not simply as a matter of personal pride, but as a matter of preserving his bottom line.  And yet, as he's become a politician and now a public servant, Trump seems to have lost control of his image. A quick search turns up tons of unofficial Trump gear, from t-shirts to Chinese-made Make America Great Again hats. Then there are the cheesy commemorative statues, creepy dolls, and bobbleheads. Also Trump punching bags, dartboards, and toilet paper. And if a recent trademark application is accepted, you may soon be able to purchase \"novelty toy items in the nature of fake poop\" called Trump Turdz.  So does Trump still control his name and likeness now that he's become the biggest household name on the planet? The short answer is yes. Which means it's probably just a matter of time before the famously litigious president threatens to sue someone for using his name or image without his permission.  If he does so, Trump will likely invoke his \"right of publicity\"the right to control the commercial use of his own name and image. This right is most often cited by celebrities whose faces end up in ads or on products without their permission. But politicians also enjoy the right of publicity, though they seldom claim it. \"It's extremely rare for a politician to invoke the right of publicity,\" says Tyler Ochoa, a professor of law at Santa Clara University who's an expert on publicity rights. \"Mostly because it would look bad. It makes it look like they're trying to capitalize on their office for private gain or trying to suppress freedom of speech.\"  While there are no rules prohibiting presidential lawyers from handing publicity suits, Masson says, \"This is not a job for White House counsel.\"  While celebrities are usually forgiven for jealously guarding their personal brands, Americans treat politicians' images as public property. \"Political figures are supposed to be busy running the country,\" says Jonathan Faber, an intellectual property attorney whose clients have included Rosa Parks, the estate of Princess Diana, and a couple of former presidents (whom he's not at liberty to name). \"If a sitting official has lawyers sending cease-and-desist letters to an ad agency or a company manufacturing products, it often doesn't play out very well.\"  Most unapproved portrayals of politicians are protected by the First Amendment, particularly if they involve opinion, commentary, parody, or other forms of protected speech. But unapproved commercial uses of politicians' names and likenesses are not protected, especially if someone is transparently trying to make a buck. Shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama fired a couple of legal warning shots at companies that tried to cash in on his and his family's popularity, including a clothing firm that put up a Times Square billboard showing him in one of its jackets, and the maker of Beanie Babies, which had cranked out dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia. After that, companies largely respected the line Obama had drawn. \"The president has a lot of clout,\" Faber says. \"Most companies don't want to do something that might offend the president.\"  Despite his initial promise to keep a close watch on his image, Obama would eventually ignore thousands of products with no political message that likely infringed on his publicity rights. Sean Masson, a civil litigator who has written about the presidential right of publicity, notes some obvious examples, such as a \"Yes We Can\" can opener, chicken \"Obama-Fingers,\" and Obama condoms (\"The ultimate stimulus package\"). Yet Masson thinks Obama was smart to pick his intellectual property battles, and would advise Trump to do the same. Faber agrees that politicians should exercise discretion when enforcing their right of publicity. \"You should respond to things that are clear infringements and would be well advised to tolerate things that are nonactionable,\" he says.  Nonetheless, a handful of major politicians have gone after personalized products or ads that bothered them. In 2004, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger filed a right of publicity suit against the maker of a bobblehead that depicted him wearing a suit with a bandolier and an assault rifle. Ochoa describes it as a case of \"stealth defamation\"meaning that Schwarzenegger was trying to shelve a product that made him look bad without actually filing a defamation case, which would have forced him to prove that he'd been intentionally disparaged. Such Hollywood hubris wasn't a good look for the newly-elected Governator, and \"he was pretty quick to settle once the news hit the media,\" Ochoa recalls. (The bobblehead maker agreed to disarm the figure and made a donation to Schwarzenegger's nonprofit afterschool program.)  \"It's extremely rare for a politician to invoke the right of publicity. It makes it look like they're trying to capitalize on their office for private gain or trying to suppress freedom of speech.\"  In 1997, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sued New York magazine for running ads on buses that used his name without permission. A federal judge rejected his complaint, noting that \"one who has chosen to be Mayor, and therefore to be the subject of daily commentary and controversy, cannot avoid the limelight of publicitygood and bad.\" In 1999, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura sent a cease-and-desist letter to a woman who made a Valentine's Day card featuring him in the signature feather boa he'd worn as a pro wrestler. (She stopped making them.) And in 1970, Vice President Spiro Agnew complained his privacy had been violated by a dartboard that featured a drawing of his face and the phrase \"Et Tu, Spiro!\" The dartboard's makers responded that their product was making a political comment and was protected by the First Amendment. The company enlisted the help of radical lawyer William Kunstler, and the matter was settled out of court.  It's not hard not to imagine the president following in the footsteps of similarly thin-skinned personalities like Agnew and Giuliani and celebrity politicians like Ventura and Schwarzenegger. In 2013, Trump got into a beef with Mac Miller, accusing the rapper of \"illegally\" using his name without permission in a song titled \"Donald Trump\":  Little @MacMiller, you illegally used my name for your song Donald Trump which now has over 75 million hits.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2013  Last February, a Los Angeles artist named Illma Gore published a t of a naked, un-bigly endowed Trump tilted \"Make America Great Again\" that quickly went viral. Gore says that she was contacted by people claiming to represent Trump who threatened both copyright and right of publicity claims, but no lawsuit materialized. (The incident recalls the 1978 case in which Muhammad Ali sued Playgirl [NSFW] for running an illustration of a nude boxer who looked just like \"The Greatest\"at least above the trunks.) Not long after Trump trademarked \"Make America Great Again\" in 2015, his lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to CafePress and other sites that were selling unapproved Trump merch.  Though the president has yet to object about his image being exploited since his election, Faber believes \"it's only a matter of time.\" Trump's ongoing business interests give him additional incentives for pursuing anyone he thinks is ripping off his brand. And he has more resources and avenues to do so than his predecessors. For the first time, \"we have a president who has the ability to lean on trademark registration as an added argument,\" Faber says. \"There are some pending trademark applications that I'm sure Donald Trump would not be particularly fond of.\"  If Trump does pursue a right of publicity case, he'd be wise to do it on his own time and with his money, says Masson: \"It's important to pursue it in your personal capacity, not in your capacity as a sitting president.\" And while there are no laws or rules prohibiting presidential lawyers from getting involved in publicity suits, Masson says, \"This is not a job for White House counsel.\" Since Trump has not completely separated himself from his companies and investments, using taxpayer money to protect his personal brand would look unseemly. Not that bad PR or the appearance of conflicts of interest have ever deterred Trump. \"The president has a track record for really knee-jerk policy decisions,\" Masson says. \"And the chances are that if he tries to enforce his right of publicity rights, he'll do it in an equally ham-fisted manner. While he's legally entitled to do so, I don't think it gains him anything politically. In fact, I think it hurts him.\"  Anyone who's holding off on releasing a Trump product until his name and image enter the public domain has a long wait ahead. They're his for the rest of his life. Federal law also prohibits anyone from using a deceased former president's \"name, portrait, or signature\" without the approval of his widow, if she outlives him. A president's estate may control his intellectual property for many years following his death. (The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, for example, owns the rights to the Gipper's signature.) And the Trump Organization could lay claim to its namesake's image well into the 21st century.  Whenor ifthe day comes when someone wants to name a public building or piece of infrastructure after Trump, there's little chance of stepping on his publicity rights. That means that, conceivably, a name whose value stems from its use on luxury hotels and vanity brands could end up on a sanitary landfill or sewage treatment facility. (In 2008, San Francisco voters considered a ballot measure that would have named the municipal wastewater plant after President George W. Bush; it was rejected.) If Trump tried to stop such a move, Ochoa says, \"I think a court would probably say that the criticism falls under the First Amendment. And if they name an airport or a school after him, he's not going to object. He loves that kind of adulation.\"", "date": "2017/02/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-name-publicity-rights", "title": "Most Presidents Ignore Products That Rip Off Their Names. Will Trump?"}, {"text": "During an alternative-fact-filled interview with Bill O'Reilly on Sunday, President Donald Trump launched into a diatribe about California pushing back against his immigration policies, suggesting that he would try to cut off the Golden State's federal funding. \"We give tremendous amounts of money to California,\" he said. \"California in many ways is out of control, as you know.\"  Assuming that Trump was speaking on behalf of the federal government, he was, in fact, correct that \"we\" give lots of money to California. Annually, the feds spend nearly $368 billion in California, which includes everything from paying government contracts to cutting Social Security checks. Yet implicit in Trump's comments was the assumption that Californians are gobbling up or blowing through \"tremendous amounts\" of government spending without paying their fair share in return. That's wrong.  An accumulation of data from various sources shows that California routinely pays more in federal taxes than it receives in federal spending. A 2015 study by the New York state comptroller found that in 2013 Californians paid $9,086 per capita in federal taxes and received $9,040 per capita in federal spendingor about 99 cents of spending for every tax dollar. (This is an improvement: The Tax Foundation found that California received about 78 cents in spending for every tax dollar in 2005, and Census and IRS data showed the state getting back 87 cents on the dollar in 2010.) In comparison, the average state gets about $1.29 in federal money for every dollar it sends to Washington.  California pays about 13 percent of all federal taxes and receives about 11 percent of federal expenditures. It's one of 11 states with a deficit between what it pays the feds and what it gets back. New Jersey has the biggest annual gap between spending and taxes, at more than $2,600 per person. New Mexico enjoys the biggest surplus, at more than $7,700 per person.  Here's how all the states stack up in terms of federal taxes paid and spending received.  States pay a wide range of taxes per capita. Connecticut pays nearly $14,000 per person, while Mississippians pay about $4,800 apiece.  Federal spending by state also varies widely. Swamp-adjacent Virginia gets more than $16,800 per person. (Washington, DC, itself brings in a whopping $65,000 per resident.) Arid Utah, on the other hand, gets just $7,000 per person per year.

At a rally in July, Trump noted the efficacy of attacks on the Affordable Care Act: \"One of the things that gets constantly_the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\" Since the election, some Republican lawmakers have softened their stance a bit, suggesting that Obamacare may simply be \"scaled back.\" But there's little doubt that they will still make a show of upholding their promise to chip away at, if not totally repeal, Obamacare. Trump, who once advocated universal health coverage, has said he will replace the existing plan with \"something terrific,\" though he has yet to offer a serious alternative.  Here's another catch: While most Americans say they dislike Obamacare, they actually like most of its provisions. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, every major part of the Affordable Care Act is exceedingly popular except for onethe imposition of fines for not having health coverage. This might explain why some Trump voters are reacting with alarm now that they realize some kind of ACA repeal looks likely.  If Obamacare is fully repealed, most Americans will see a modest tax cut, while tens of millions will face a loss of coverage or become uninsurable. And thousands could die from lack of access to medical care. As Obamacare slips back into critical condition, here's a look at these and other consequences of its possible demise.

Ram_rez was brought to the United States by his parents when he was a child, and in 2014 he became one of the 750,000 immigrants to be shielded from deportation by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  How Trump plans to handle so-called DACAmented people has caused considerable anxiety in immigrant communities. Reports about Ram_rez's apprehension confirm what many advocates have been saying: Despite assurances from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that its high-profile deportation raids last week focused on serious criminals, agents also inquired about the immigration status of other people in the general vicinityand detained those who were undocumented.  According to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, 680 immigrants were arrested last week in what he called \"a series of targeted enforcement operations\" spread out over 12 states. Kelly echoed ICE's claims that these deportation actions were no different from those the agency has carried out for years, and he noted that roughly 75 percent of those arrested \"were criminal aliens.\" But the unusually public and coordinated nature of ICE's enforcement surge\"not entirely a coincidence,\" according to an agency spokeswomanhas led to widespread misinformation about what immigration officials are doing.  Here's what we've learned from the past weekand what we're still trying to figure out:  ICE is casting a wider net.  Even before news broke of Ram_rez's arrest, immigrant rights advocates had complained of people without criminal records being questioned and detained by ICE agents. Sarah Owings, the Georgia-Alabama chapter chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), points to a passage in the agency's press release on last week's actions: \"During targeted enforcement operations ICE officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in the United States in violation of federal immigration laws. Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.\" \"So what that says,\" Owings concludes, \"is that anybody's a suspect.\"  In Ram_rez's case, Reuters reported, it was his father who was originally targeted by ICE. When agents entered his father's house on Friday morning, they asked Ram_rez about his immigration status. Even after he told them about his work permit under DACAwhich was renewed in 2016they brought him to a detention center in Tacoma. (An ICE spokeswoman said in a statement that Ram_rez was a \"self-admitted gang member,\" a claim that his lawyers say he denies.)  In a Washington Post story from last weekend, an unidentified immigration official explained the raids this way: \"Big cities tend to have a lot of illegal immigrants. They're going to a target-rich environment.\" \"What also may be true,\" says ACLU senior staff attorney Andre Segura, \"is that ICE could be retaliating against cities that have more welcoming policies, just based on where they're doing it so far. But it's difficult to tell how this will play out.\"  Most of the rumors on social media weren't true.  Social media flared last week with the fears of immigrants and their advocatesfueled by a series of unconfirmed rumors that caused panic and confusion. But in many cases, the rumors just didn't check out. In Kansas City, a Facebook post claimed that ICE agents were going to stop churchgoers; it was later debunked. Segura says he found no evidence of ICE checkpoints in Austin, despite multiple tweets and posts about them. He also hadn't heard any confirmation of multiple rumors of parents being detained while picking up their children at school.  Segura notes that in past enforcement surges, ICE has typically moved in the early morning hours. \"But it seems like now they're being done in a little bit of a cavalier way,\" he says. \"I think that can be purposeful, but it can cause a lot of panic.\" By making arrests in such a public way, ICE has created uncertainty and speculation about what's really happening.  But sometimes reality is even more troubling than rumor: The El Paso Times reported Wednesday that agents had arrested a transgender woman at the El Paso County Courthouse after she had just gotten a protective order as an alleged victim of domestic violence. Worse yet, her abuser may have tipped them off.  ICE still isn't good at transparency.  Because ICE has failed to release more complete information, it's still unclear what crimes the \"criminal aliens\" arrested during last week's raids had committed. Were the majority of them violent criminals? Or were many of them guilty of minor offenses like driving without a license?  But it's not just the lack of statistics. Several immigration attorneys and advocates have told me that since Trump's election, ICE agents have been far less forthcoming with information. Owings says ICE has pulled out of an upcoming AILA chapter conference. A Customs and Border Protection rep will appear but won't take questions from attorneys about Trump's executive orders. \"ICE is very reticent to give us any information,\" Owings says. \"Our liaison contacts are all really clammed up. They just don't want to tell us what's going on, because they don't want to say the wrong thing and then be held to that word. Because none of this was discussed with the appropriate agencies prior to the pronouncement of these orders.\"  And it remains to be seen how ICE will communicate with Congress.  After canceling a Tuesday meeting to discuss last week's raids with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, agency leadership rescheduled the meeting for Thursday. Predictably, it didn't go well:  1. After attending the ICE meeting it's hard not to conclude that President Trump has started his mass deportation plan.

Some callers reported being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at their homes. Others were caught at their workplaces, including one man detained at a Target store. The first round of Trump-era deportation sweeps had begun.  The news quickly filtered back to immigrant rights activists, who confirmed the detentions and alerted their networks. According to Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), as many as 134 immigrants were detained in the sweep. Based on her conversations with lawyers, many of those detained had outstanding orders for deportationand some were sent back to Mexico as early as Thursday afternoon.  On Thursday evening, activists held a vigil at ICE's downtown Los Angeles field office. Later, an estimated 100 to 150 protesters blocked a nearby highway on-ramp:  #BREAKINGNEWS: 101 onramp in downtown LA blocked by protests against ICE raidshttps://t.co/rSTn4B0eGd pic.twitter.com/SPDbYsxLgC  ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) February 10, 2017  In a Friday afternoon press release, ICE said 160 immigrants were arrested during what it called a \"five-day targeted enforcement operation\" in Southern California that was \"aimed at at-large criminal aliens, illegal re-entrants, and immigration fugitives.\" Of the 160, ICE claimed that 150 had criminal histories, and that 5 of the remaining 10 had final orders of removal or had been previously deported. While the release said \"many of the arrestees had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses,\" ICE did not give a full breakdown of those convictions.  Earlier Friday, an ICE spokeswoman told Mother Jones that \"enforcement surges have been part of our operational play book for many years.\" The subsequent press release echoed that line: \"The focus was no different than the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis.\"  The sweep was the second high-profile ICE action in two days. On Wednesday night, immigration agents in Phoenix found themselves swarmed by protesters when they attempted to deport Guadalupe Garc_a de Rayos, a 35-year-old Mexican immigrant with two teenage children who are American citizens. Garc_a de Rayos had been caught using a fake Social Security number during an ICE workplace raid in 2008.  Garc_a de Rayos' deportation sent shock waves through the immigrant rights community and dominated Spanish-language media on Thursday. Ever since the 2008 raid, she had checked in annually with ICE to review her casebrief meetings that always resulted in her walking free, even though she had been convicted of a felony and later had a deportation order against her. This partly reflected the Obama administration's emphasis on deporting serious criminal offenders. But her deportation to Nogales, Mexico, signals that the Trump administration plans to follow through with its plans to remove all undocumented immigrants who've committed \"acts that constitute a chargeable offense\"which, as Vox's Dara Lind has pointed out, could include everything from entering the country illegally to driving without a license. (In a statement to reporters Thursday, ICE said it will \"focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal.\")  Indeed, social media was abuzz Friday with rumors of deportation raids throughout the country. On a conference call late in the day, Dave Marin, ICE's LA field office director for enforcement and removal operations, confirmed that there were also operations in Atlanta, Chicago, and New York during the week. And Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) tweeted Friday afternoon about additional ICE activity in South and Central Texas:  I'm concerned about the ICE raids in Texas. My statement: pic.twitter.com/SeeDSwAmyM  Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) February 10, 2017  \"A lot of things have changed since January 20,\" says CHIRLA's Salas. She notes that during the Obama years, ICE would typically give groups like CHIRLA basic information such as names and the number of people detained following any large sweep or workplace raid. But Salas says she finds it troubling that following Thursday's actions, there was little to no communication with the agency. \"It's important that we don't get used to the idea that they don't have to give out this information,\" she says.  CHIRLA is currently focusing on educating immigrant communities on civil and constitutional rights. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center, greater Los Angeles is home to 1 million undocumented immigrantssecond only to the New York City area, which is home to 1.15 million. On Friday, the group ran hourly know-your-rights workshops, and it's also holding legal clinics where immigrants can get advice. Similar efforts have been happening nationwide: Earlier this week, for example, public school educators in Austin, Texas, handed out flyers to students in English and Spanish about what to do in an encounter with immigration officials.  Salas says that organizers' next step is to continue to engage elected officials. Notably, Rep. Ruben Gallegos (D-Ariz.) and California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le_n have criticized ICE on Twitter over the last day.  \"We have to set the tone,\" Salas says, \"that this is not acceptable.\"  This story has been updated.", "date": "2017/02/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-deportation-ice-raid-los-angeles-phoenix", "title": "The Trump Deportation Regime Has Begun"}, {"text": "This story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.  Many of the folks I know are getting ready to play serious defense in 2017, and they're not wrong. Before we take up our three-point stance on the national line of scrimmage, however, maybe we should ask ourselves not only what we're fighting against, but what we're fighting for. What kind of United States of America do we actually want? Maybe, in fact, we could start by asking: What is a country for? What should a country do? Why do people establish countries in the first place?  There is much that will need defending over the next four years.  There is, without question, much that will need defending over the next four years, so much that people fought and died for in the 20th century, so much that is threatened by the ascendancy of Donald Trump, the white nationalist right, and the Republican Party. The 20th century saw the introduction of many significant laws, regulations, andyesentitlements: benefits to which we have a right by virtue of living in, and in many cases being citizens of, this country.  We could start earlier, but let's begin with the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. It established the right of workers to collectively negotiate wages and working conditions with their employers and made collective bargaining the official \"policy of the United States.\" This policy faces an immediate threat. Identical Republican-sponsored bills in the House and Senate would end the right of unions to require the workers they represent to pay union dues. These bills would, in other words, reproduce at the federal level the so-called right-to-work (more accurately, right-to-starve) laws already in place in more than half the states. Ifor as seems likely, whenthey pass, millions of workers will face the potential loss of the power of collective bargaining and find themselves negotiating with employers as lonely individuals.  Then there was the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which guaranteed a minimum wage and overtime pay to many workers (although not, notably, those laboring in agricultural fields or inside other people's homesworkplaces then occupied primarily by African Americans, and later by other people of color as well). Andrew F. Puzder, Trump's pick for secretary of labor, opposes the very idea of a minimum wage. This shouldn't be too surprising, since his current day job is as CEO of the parent company of two fast-food franchise operations, Hardee's and Carl's Jr.  We could mention other New Deal-era victories under threat: Social Security, unemployment insurance, food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (now known as TANF for Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or more commonly simply as \"welfare\"), which was created to promote the well-being of children in families facing poverty. In the coming Trump years, we can expect predation on all these programsfrom renewed efforts to \"privatize\" Social Security to further restrictions on welfare. Indeed, former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert, Trump's transition team point man on Social Security, is a firm believer in \"privatization,\" the idea that the federal government should encourage people to gamble on the stock market rather than rely on a guaranteed government pension.  The establishment of Medicare ended all the stories of seniors eating pet food because they couldn't afford medicine and groceries.  The one entitlement program that will probably survive unscathed is SNAP, because its primary beneficiaries are not the people who use it to buy groceries but the giant agricultural corporations it indirectly subsidizes. It's no accident that, unlike other entitlement programs, SNAP is administered by the Department of Agriculture.  Then there was the 1937 Housing Act, designed to provide financial support to cities so they could improve the housing stock of poor people, which eventually led to the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In Ben Carson we are about to have a HUD secretary who, in addition to having announced that he's not qualified to head a federal agency, doesn't believe in the very programs HUD exists to support.  And so it goes with the victories of the second half of the 20th century. In Jeff Sessions, for instance, we have a potential attorney general staunchly opposed to the civil and voting rights won by African Americans (and women of all races, in the case of the 1964 Civil Rights Act). In Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, we'll have a climate change denier and fossil fuel advocate running the Environmental Protection Agency.  Medicare entitlesthere's that word againolder people and some with chronic illnesses to federally subsidized health care. Its introduction in 1965 ended the once common newspaper and TV stories about senior citizens eating pet food because they couldn't afford both medicine and groceries. That program, too, will reportedly be under threat.  There's more to defend. Take widespread access to birth control, now covered by health insurance under Obamacare. I'm old enough to remember having to pretend I was married to get a doctor to prescribe the Pill, and being grateful for the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that guaranteed me a legal abortion, when a gynecologist told me I couldn't conceive. (He was wrong.) Then there are the guarantees of civil rights for LGB (if not yet T) people won in the 1990s, culminating in the astonishing 2015 Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges granting marriage rights to same-sex couples. All of this could be wiped out with a couple of Trumpian Supreme Court picks.  So many of us are likely to be under attack that we will recognize the need for broad-based coalitions.  Nor should we forget that in addition to people's rights, there are actual people to defend in the brave new world of Trumplandia, or at least to help defend themselves: immigrants, Muslims, African Americansespecially young menas well as people facing poverty and homelessness.  One potentially unexpected benefit of the coming period: So many of us are likely to be under attack in one way or another that we will recognize the need for broad-based coalitions, working at every level of society and throughout its institutions. Such groups already exist, some more developed than others. I'm thinking, for example, of United for Peace and Justice, which came together to oppose Bush-era wars and domestic policies; the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, a national coalition of community organizations led by people of color; and National People's Action, another effective coalition of community organizations. On the state level, there is the powerful work of the Moral Mondays project, led by the North Carolina NAACP and its president, the Reverend William J. Barber II. In my own backyard, there are the many community groups that make up San Francisco Rising and Oakland Rising.  Such multi-issue organizations can be sources of solidarity for people and groups focused on important single issues, from the Fight for Fifteen (that's dollars-an-hour minimum wage) to opposing the bizarrely named First Amendment Defense Act, which would protect the right of business proprietors to refuse service to people whose presence in their establishments violates \"a religious belief or moral conviction that: (1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.\"    As important as such defensive actions will be, we're going to need something beyond a good defense: a coherent reason why all these disparate things are worth defending. We need to be able to say why black lives, women's lives, workers' lives, brown and immigrant lives matter in the first place. We need a vision of a society in which not only do all people's lives matter, but where they all have the possibility of being good lives. We need a picture of what a country is for, so that as we fight, we understand not only the horrors we oppose, but what it is we desire.  Aristotle's understanding of the good life left an awful lot of people out.  Fortunately, we don't have to start any description of what a good human life consists of from scratch. People have been discussing the subject for at least as long as they've left written records, and probably far longer. In the third century BCE, Aristotle proposed that the good lifehappinessconsists of developing and using our intellectual and moral capacities to the fullest possible extent across an entire lifetime. The good life meant learning and then practicing wisdom, courage, justice, and generosityalong with some lesser virtues, like being entertaining at a dinner party.  Aristotle wasn't an idiot, however. He also knew that people need the basics of survivalfood, clothing, shelter, health, and friendshipif they are to be happy. Not surprisingly, he had a distinctly limited idea about which human beings could actually achieve such happiness. It boiled down to men of wealth who had the leisure to develop their abilities. His understanding of the good life left a lot of people, including women, slaves, and children, out of the circle of the fully human.  Although it may sound strange to 21st-century American ears, Aristotle also thought the purpose of government was to help people (at least those he thought were capable of it) to live happy lives, in part by making laws that would guide them into developing the capacities crucial to that state.  Who nowadays thinks that happiness is the government's business? Perhaps more of us should. After all, the Founding Fathers did.    Where should we who seek to defend our country against the advance of what some are now going so far as to call \"fascism\" enter this conversation about the purpose of government? It might make sense to take a look at a single sentence written by a group of white men, among them slaveholders, who also thought happiness was the government's business. I'm referring, of course, to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence. Its much-quoted second sentence reads in full:  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Political philosopher Danielle Allen has pointed out that modern versions of the Declaration's text \"update\" the original punctuation with a period after \"happiness.\" But that full stop obscures the whole point of the sentence. Not only do people self-evidently possess \"unalienable\" rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but the very reason we form governments in the first place is to \"secure\" those rights. Furthermore, when a governmentrather than protecting life, liberty, and happiness\"becomes destructive\" of them, we have the right to abolish it and put a better one in its place, always keeping in mind that the purpose of any new government should be to \"effect\" the people's safety and happiness.  Of course, beginning any conversation with those words from the Declaration raises the obvious question: \"Who's we'?\" Can those of us who are women, people of color, descendants of slaves and/or slaveholders, all claim participation in that \"we\"? Should we want to? Danielle Allen, who describes herself as biracial and a feminist, addresses the contradictions inherent in claiming this document for our own in her valuable book Our Declaration. She concludes that we not only can, we must. There is too much at stake for us to cede equality to a white, male minority.    What would it mean to take seriously the idea that people create governments so they can enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? What would the United States look like if that were its purpose?  Let's start with life. It's reasonable to think that the Declaration's authors were following the ideas of another dead white man, John Locke, who believed that people create governments so that they don't have to spend all their time and energy preventing other people from hurting them, or taking revenge when they've been hurt. Instead, people delegate this authority to governments.  But what has the US government done with those delegated powers?  Americans have been told repeatedly that we have to choose between \"security\" and freedom.  Over the last 15 years of what we still call the \"war on terror,\" Americans have been told repeatedly that we have to choose between life and liberty, between \"security\" and freedom. We can't have both. Do we want to be safe from terrorists? Then we must allow mass collection of our telephone and internet data. And we must create a registry of Muslims living in this country. Do we want to be safe on our streets? Then we must allow federal and state governments to keep 2.2 million people locked up and another 4.5 million on probation or parole. Ours is the largest prison population in the world, in raw numbers and in proportion to our population. Safety on the street, we're told, also demands an increase in the amount of video surveillance Americans experience. And that's just to start down a long list of the ways our liberties have been curtailed in these years.  At the same time, successive Congresses and administrations have cut the programs that once helped sustain life in this country. Now, with the threatened repeal of Obamacare (and so the potential loss of medical insurance for at least 20 million Americans), the Republicans may literally cut off the lives of people who depend on that program for treatments that help them survive.  The preamble of the Constitution also establishes the importance of life, liberty, and happiness, with slightly different language. In it, \"We the people\" establish that Constitution for the following purposes:  [T]to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity_  Is it possible that our common \"defence\" is not, in fact, aided by maintaining the world's most powerful military, garrisoning the planet, and endlessly projecting power across the globe? After all, the United States is protected by an ocean off each coast and friendly countries on our northern and southern borders (although we may not always deal with them as friends should be treated). Certainly, I want my government to defend me from invading armies; on the other hand, I'm not convinced my safety is increased when the United States does the invading.  It's useful, too, as we think about the purpose of government, to consider the idea of the \"general Welfare.\" This phrase implies something important: My welfare, my good life, is bound up with yours. The people established the Constitution to promote the welfare of all of us, and not of a tiny, mega-rich minority that is now running our government. We could do worse than reclaim the importance of the general welfare, with its suggestion that it is the primary business of any decent government to promote our wellbeing.    Surely the definition of the good life, of happiness itself, is such a personal thing that it can't be the subject of legislation or the object of government. Perhaps that's true, but I'd like to introduce one more thinker here, also white, and, sadly, deceased: the political philosopher Iris Marion Young. In her Justice and the Politics of Difference, she offered a definition of a good human life.  We can say, Young argued, that a society is more or less a just one depending on the degree to which it satisfies basic physical needs and, equally importantly (as Aristotle also believed), \"supports the institutional conditions necessary\" for people to participate in self-development. To her, that means \"learning and using satisfying and expansive skills,\" as well as the expression of \"our experience, feelings, and perspective on social life in contexts where others can listen.\" But self-development and expression, she says, are not sufficient for a good life. We also need self-determinationthat is, participation in the decisions that affect our lives and how we live them.  O, let America be America again  The land that never has been yet.  We have much to defend, but we also should have a vision to advance. As we fight against a secretary of education who abhors public schools, we should also be fighting for the right of all of us to develop and use those \"expansive and satisfying skills\"from reading and writing to creating and doingthat make life worth living. In a society with less and less demand for nonrobotic workers, education will be more important than ever, not just so people can earn their livings, but also so that their lives are valuable and valued.  As we fight against an administration of generals and billionaires, we should also be fighting for a country where we are free to express ourselves in language, dress, song, and ritual, without fear of finding ourselves on a registry or all our communications in the files of a spy agency. As we fight against a president elected by a minority of voters, we fight for a country in which we can take part in the decisions that affect all aspects of our lives.  For many years I've opposed most of what my country stands for in the world. As a result, I often tended to see its founding documents as so many beautiful but meaningless promises spoken in our time to convince us and the world that the coups, invasions, and occupations we engaged in do represent life and liberty.  But what if we were actually to take those words at face value? Not naively, but with the bitter nuance of the black poet Langston Hughes who, recognizing both the promise and the sham, wrote:  O, let America be America again  The land that never has been yet  And yet must bethe land where every man is free.  The land that's minethe poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME  Who made America,  Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,  Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,  Must bring back our mighty dream again.  Maybe it's not so strange that, in these dismal times, I find my hope in a dream, now hundreds of years old, of a country dedicated to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I guess it's time to develop those satisfying and expansive skills of thinking, organizing, and acting to bring back that mighty dream again, that dream of a land that never has been yetbut will be.

It was a bold move. She's American born, but her parents immigrated from Iran. Theirs was one of few minority familieslet alone Iranian onesin her small Oklahoma town. The September 11 attacks were only about five years in the rearview mirror, and her classmates were hitting the age when kids become more aware of the worldand of their parents' political viewpoints, which in this case leaned pretty conservative.  One fellow student, after calling her \"terrorist\" all day at school, punched Katebi in the face.  To some of her schoolmates, Islam seemed scary, freakish. The hijab made Katebi a target for taunts, and worse. One middle-school student, after calling her \"terrorist\" all day at school, punched her in the face. A few years later, in high school, a peer pulled off her hijab, demanding to see her hair. Katebi never reported the assaults. She was convinced her teachers would look the other way rather than try and defend her. It was up to her to convince people around her that she was not to be feared, and that she largely shared their values.  In the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries (including Iran), Katebi, now 22, finds herself in the position of having to explain her culture to people all over again. Indeed, it's part of her job. A year out of college, she heads up communications for the Chicago branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which says Trump's immigration order targets Muslims directlydespite the administration's claims to the contrary. CAIR is working with lawyers and other civil rights organizations to help people who have been detained in airports or stranded overseas as a result of the ban.  But Katebi was working to bridge the gap between America and the Middle East long before CAIR hired her. In her hometown, people were always looking to her to speak on behalf of all Middle Easternerson everything from the history of Islam to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Their questions compelled her to study up on Muslim history and culture so she could push back against her peers' misguided views.  Continuing discrimination led her to develop a \"don't give a shit attitude\" that later gave way to a healthier outlet for her frustrations. Recognizing the power of the hijab to dictate how people viewed her, Katebi became interested in the use of clothing as a political statement. So, the summer after her freshman year at the University of Chicago, she launched a fashion blog, calling it JooJoo Azad (\"Free Bird\" in Farsi). \"Fashion is inherently and deeply political,\" Katebi writes, and not many Americans understand just how complex and diverse fashion for Muslim women can be. She told me she wanted to \"yell in a productive way\" and tackle the nexus of clothing, Islam, and feminisma topic she now lectures on.  For her undergraduate thesis, Katebi chose Iran's underground fashion scene, and she traveled to Tehran during the summer of 2015 to research the topic. The Iranian designers she met were trending toward traditional motifs and designs, but also creating pieces that technically violated the country's Islamic dress code. Iranian law requires women to cover their heads and to dress modestly, usually keeping their torsos, waist area, and a good part of their legs covered with large, loose garments. Rules on acceptable colors fluctuate depending on who is in charge, as does the zeal of the Gashte Ershad (morality police), who enforce the rules. Punishments can range from a warning or a ticket to arrest, in extreme cases.  During her trip, as many Iranian women do, Katebi tested the limits of the dress codes. She found that the Gashte Ershad rarely enforced it, and that violations are common. One officer saw her wearing a tight crop-top shirt that only covered her torso. He simply yelled that she should \"cover up,\" and then he drove away, she recalls.  Alongside her thesis work, Katebi collected material for her 2016 book, Tehran Streetstyle. The designers wanted Katebi to expose their art to the rest of the world, and her Western blog audience was clamoring for a window into Iranian fashion. The result was a collection of images of a sort Americans seldom seeIranian women clad in vibrant colors, with creative designs and trendy accessories. While Katebi and most of the designers she spoke with dislike the dress codes, their feelings are complicated. \"There's a level of resisting the hijab law, but also wanting to resist Western cultural hegemony that exists globally,\" Katebi explains.  At a time when the US government is projecting a sinister view of Islam to the public, Katebi's work pushes in the opposite direction, helping open-minded Americans appreciate the nuances and diversity in Muslim culture. It's been a constant tug of war, and the fact that few Americans even bother to learn the basics of Islam before forming an opinion has not made her job easier.  In fact, the rhetoric of the 2016 campaign and beyond, combined with the recent attacks in Europe and the United States, have contributed to a notable resurgence of Islamophobia here. Hate crimes against Muslims spiked 67 percent in 2015, according to FBI data, and there have been many troubling incidents since the election. In late January, as the White House issued its immigration ban, a mosque in Texas was burned down and a gunman attacked the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center in Canada, leaving six people dead and five hospitalized. President Trump, Katebi says, continues to use the same divisive rhetoric against Muslims in the name of national security that leaders employed after 9/11. \"Muslims are just recovering,\" she says, \"from the effects of what happened in 2002.\"  Ever since Trump's immigration order, Katebi has been running on \"water and Starbursts.\"  At least 18 people were detained at O'Hare International Airport thanks to Trump's executive order. Protestersincluding Katebi and others from CAIRflooded the airport with signs and chants demanding that detainees be allowed access to lawyers and that they be admitted into the country. A judge issued a stay to Trump's order, but that injunction is temporary. Organizers are still scrambling to protect people left in limbo, including a friend of Katebi's, a Stanford doctoral student who had to cancel his flight to the United States and now can't get back to school. For Katebi, the past week has been a nonstop work frenzy. As she put it, she's been running on \"water and Starbursts.\"  While she's encouraged by the crowds showing up at the airport to protest Trump's immigration move, Katebi has taken to her blog to challenge misconceptions even among Americans who support Muslim immigration. Consider the viral image of the woman clad in a stars-and-stripes hijab. The artwork was intended as a show of solidarity, but Katebi pointed out that it was the work of a white (non-Muslim) manShepard Fairey, the same artist who did the Barack Obama \"Hope\" posterand noted that the woman who modeled for the poster does not normally wear the hijab.  She also made the point that, given the fraught history of American military actions in the Middle East, the image sends a decidedly mixed message. \"I understand the good intentions,\" Katebi wrote, \"but my liberation will not come from framing my body with a flag that has flown every time my people have fallen. And I hope yours will not either.\"  Please Keep Your American Flag Off My Hijab -- my latest on JooJoo Azad: https://t.co/5uBbFbkVVS / #womensmarch pic.twitter.com/uneuw6ikce  Hoda Katebi (@hodakatebi) January 23, 2017  As the Trump regime ramps up, Katebi is dreading the prospect of having to play teacher all over again. \"Educating people on the very basics, like 'Islam is a religion of peace; this is what I believe,' it's incredibly emotionally taxing!\" she says. \"Having to deal with all of that and be able to respond in a very polite, educational manner is harder than people think.\"", "date": "2017/02/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/hoda-katebi-iran-muslim-fashion-chicago-cair-immigration", "title": "America Has a Lot to Learn From This Muslim Fashion Blogger"}, {"text": "This is not Bonnie. (It's a stock photo.)  On a September evening at the United Church of Christ in Sunnyvale, California, a dozen people are sitting in folding chairs arranged in a circle. Nearby, a plastic folding table is topped with cookies and fruit. (Coffee is notably absent.) The setup is basically that of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, except that the group, mostly older and mostly white, isn't here to deal with chemical dependency. Rather, they have decided they want to better understand their own prejudices and take part in productive conversations about race.  Welcome to Racists Anonymous, the brainchild of the Reverend Ron Buford, the church's pastor. Buford, who is black, was fed up with attending race talks where either he left feeling angry or white attendees left feeling guilty. During the presidential campaign, he watched Donald Trump and others sow racial division, and he decided to fight back. What would happen, he thought, if we treated racism like a disease, one that all of us suffer from?  Using AA as a model, he began hosting meetings last January, and before long he was sharing his program with friends at other churches. To date, he says, more than 90 congregations in four countries have requested the kit he's put together, and at least six have established their own programs.  \"Once you accept the fact that we're all racists, it's just varying degrees.\"  Trump's ascendancepunctuated by his choice of Alabama's Jeff Sessions for attorney generalhas exacerbated tensions and brought about an increase in racist speech and hate crimes. White nationalists have gained national prominence, and many observers worry that unlawful discrimination will be overlooked, or even encouraged, in Trump's America. The election also spurred conversation about whether progressives have done enough to reach rural America. On election eve, CNN commentator Van Jones called Trump's win a \"whitelash,\" an anxious response to the nation's growing multiculturalism.  The Reverend Buford hopes to ease these anxieties by bringing together regular people who have never had reason to confront their own conflicted feelings about race. \"I don't think we realized it was really as bad as it was,\" Buford says. \"We're going to have to talk about it.\"  Even before the election, police shootings of unarmed black men and racist incidents on college campuses were bringing about calls for a national dialogue. Businesses, universities, government organizations (including the Department of Justice), and many police departments have implemented training on diversity and racial sensitivities. And such sessions have become a part of many freshman college orientations.  But these programs may not be so effective, at least if the goal is to foster diversity. Frank Dobbin co-authored a study published in the Harvard Business Review this past summer titled \"Why Diversity Programs Fail.\" The authors looked at hiring and promotion at hundreds of businesses over 30 years to see whether diversity training had an effect. Many firms, they found, ended up with fewer women and minorities five years after the implementation of diversity training.  The main problem, according to Dobbin, is that the trainings are mandatory, and three-fourths of the firms he and his collaborators studied used negative messaging, often presenting the lessons in the context of avoiding lawsuits. \"People react very negatively to being labeled as a problem,\" Dobbin says. \"They often rebel against efforts to control their behavior and their thoughts. If you take somebody that has wishy-washy views about something and you force them to go through training, often their views will become more negative.\"  Buford wants to do things differently. His meetings are strictly voluntary, and there's a \"no-fixing\" ruleself-improvement is the priority. The first step in AA is to admit you have a problem, and the same rule applies here. \"Once you accept the fact that we're all racists, it's just varying degrees,\" Buford told me. \"In our culture, it's impossible not to be a racist to some degree.\"  During my visit, not long before the November election, Buford's group was tackling step nine: \"Making Amends.\" The participants took turns reading prayers and passages from an adapted AA booklet, and offering anecdotes about times they felt they had judged someone too quickly. One person admitted to feeling uncomfortable being on an airplane with a passenger who appeared to be Muslim. Another woman, a former teacher, felt conflicted about not stepping in when white children in the schoolyard insisted on touching a black classmate's hair. People of color in the group shared stories of encountering racism and prejudice.  \"Hi, I'm Bonnie, and I'm a racist.\"  Bonnie is one of the regulars here, a white woman originally from a rural community northwest of Milwaukee. She says she doesn't recall any African Americans living in her town, but over time she became more aware of injustice toward blacks and other marginalized groups. She remembers cheering the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision when she was in high school, and she called Martin Luther King Jr.'s work \"wonderful.\"  \"There are certainly people in the group for whom the term 'white privilege' raises their hackles.\"  But she's still working on herself. \"Somehow I can't seem to remember those weird names,\" she says of her introductions to black people.  \"On the weird' names,\" suggests a black woman across the circle, \"you might want to use 'unique,' or 'different.'\"  \"Thank you, thank you,\" Bonnie replies.  Also important, Buford says, is to lower the bar for what counts as \"racist.\" Racism here is defined as any judgment based on someone's external differencenot just skin color, but also things like gender and sexual orientation.  The toughest step, Buford and other RA participants say, is the first one. \"That was one of the most difficult things I have ever had to articulate, because I have just thought that that was one of the worst things you could be as a human being,\" says the Reverend Lori Hathner of the Coral Gables Congregational United Church of Christ in Florida. Hathner has been leading similar discussions at her church, reading from works such as W.E.B Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk. She plans to formally adopt Buford's RA program.  Once you find the strength to make that admission, Hathner says, \"it starts to break down some barriers and some walls and gives you some freedom to talk about things that I think people have been carrying inside of them.\"  One potential pitfall of a voluntary program is that the people who probably need it the most won't show up. The Reverend Nathan King, a pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ in Concord, North Carolina, launched his church's RA program this past summer. He says it tends to draw people who are engaged in \"subtle racism.\"  \"There are certainly people in the group, in the community, for whom the term 'white privilege' raises their hackles, and they bristle a bit when they hear that,\" King says. \"That's a part of denial that just has to be addressed.\"  The RA method is still a work in progress. Participants reading aloud from its adapted AA script occasionally find themselves referring to \"hangover mornings\" and such. But Buford is optimistic that with enough open-minded people, sufficient patience, and an assist from God, the program will help make a difference. \"It's kind of like a parent watching their kid learn,\" he says. \"You can't make them. You have to wait and let them learn.\"", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/racists-anonymous-church-national-discussion-race", "title": "\"Hi, I'm Bonnie, and I'm a Racist\""}, {"text": "President Barack Obama gave his farewell address on Tuesday night from McCormick Place, a huge convention center in Chicago.

On Saturday morning, Niki Mossafer Rahmati got off her flight from Tehran in Doha, Qatar, to board a connecting flight to Boston, when she got caught up in the chaos set off by President Trump's immigration order.  Rahmati, an MIT junior studying mechanical engineering, had been home with her family for winter break when she received word Wednesday morning of the pending executive order. She changed her flight to return to Boston right away, only to find that order had gone into effect in the middle of her connecting flight to Doha. She and some 30 other Iranians with legal visas were blocked from boarding the plane and sent back to Tehran. Among them, Rahmati says, were two women traveling to their pregnant daughters to help them through their last trimester.  \"Do any of the people sound like illegal immigrants?\"  \"Do any of the people sound like illegal immigrants?\" Rahmati asked in a public Facebook post after arriving back home in Tehran. \"This will not secure the borders from terrorism and illegal immigrants. It will only increase racism in the American society.

MIT alone has 38 students from Iran, 1 from Iraq, 5 from Syria, 2 from Sudan, and 1 from Somalia; two students, including Rahmati, were reportedly unable to board flights back to Boston. According to the New York Times, students from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale, among other universities, have also been affected.  Yesterday, after thousands of protesters stormed US airports to fight for the release of people detained upon arrival, a federal judge in New York blocked part of Trump's order by temporarily allowing valid visa holders who had landed in the United States to stay. Federal judges in Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington quickly followed suit, with the Massachusetts order additionally restraining enforcement of the order for visa holders traveling back to the United States in the next seven days.  In response, MIT issued a statement urging students and staff to \"fly back to Bostondirectly to Logan Airportas soon as possible, and before February 4.\" Whether or not the court order will be respected by Custom and Border Protection officials abroad is unknown.

Posts on the neo-Nazi site have included discussion of \"a new blogging platform built on node.js,\" while other less techie content has alluded to the \"chimpout\" in Ferguson, putting Jews in ovens, and Trump's \"top-tier troll\" of Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day.  In January, Enoch was outed as Mike Peinovich, a Manhattan-based software engineer. His unmasking highlighted a lingering question about the racist far-right movement that rose to prominence with Donald Trump's election: What support might the so-called alt-right have among techies?  Ever since I began investigating the extremist groups lining up behind Trump last spring, several of their leaders have made big claims to me about an alt-right following in Silicon Valley and across the broader tech industry. \"The average alt-right-ist is probably a 28-year-old tech-savvy guy working in IT,\" white nationalist Richard Spencer insisted when I interviewed him a few weeks before the election. \"I have seen so many people like that.\" Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, told me he gets donations from Silicon Valley, and that Santa Clara County, home to Apple and Intel, is his site's largest traffic source. Chuck Johnson, the publisher of the conspiracy-mongering site Got News, said he gets lots of page views from the San Francisco Bay Area.  \"If you even try to posit that racism and sexism aren't why women and minorities aren't making it, that it's some combination of talent and values, people's heads just explode.\"  After Peinovich was outed, he also insisted to me that many techies secretly identify with the alt-right, which he attributed to a backlash against the \"corporate feminist and diversity agenda\" of tech companies. \"The fact that speaking up about this virtually guarantees career and social suicide, as in my case, shows why so many white males in tech would be attracted to the alt-right.\"  None of these alt-right figures would provide any data to support their claims. As I've reported, some alt-right sites have wildly overstated their reach. Moreover, the tech industry is renowned for its globalist outlook: Public-opinion surveys conducted by a Stanford political economist have found that rank-and-file workers in Silicon Valley exhibit less racial resentment and more favorable views toward most forms of immigration than average Americans.  Nonetheless, \"alt-techies,\" as Spencer and others call them, do appear to play a role in a movement that first incubated in the backwaters of the internet and eventually spread online with the rise of Trump. Some heroes of the far right are associated with tech: They include former Breitbart News \"tech editor\" Milo Yiannopoulos; the infamous neo-Nazi hacker Andrew Auernheimer (a.k.a. Weev); and the video gaming vlogger Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, whose \"Pewdiepie\" YouTube channel featuring Nazi-themed jokes has 54 million subscribers. (Last month Kjellberg apologized for the jokes and said he is not a Nazi.)  There are also successful figures in the tech industry who appeal to and have commingled with the alt-right: The DeploraBall, a gathering of far-right activists and conspiracy theorists during Trump's inauguration, was co-organized by software investor Jeff Giesea and attended by tech billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel. San Francisco-based tech entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin is known for launching the pro-authoritarian \"neoreactionary\" movement and reportedly has been in contact with Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon. (Yarvin denies this.) Giesea and Yarvin, both of whom I interviewed, reject the \"alt-right\" label for its associations with white nationalism, yet they share the movement's disdain for the race and gender politics of the left. (Thiel's media representative did not respond to a request for comment from him.)  To further gauge the influence of the alt-right in tech, I interviewed seven people in the industry who embrace aspects of the movement. They included current or former employees of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter, some of whom responded to me after I reached out to them through their Facebook pages. They asked that I not publish their names, citing concerns about their jobs. I also interviewed two techies associated with the Daily Stormer; one declined to disclose his identity to me but has a posting history on the site indicative of working in tech in the Bay Area.  Three of the alt-techies I interviewed said explicitly that they were white nationalists. The others did not identify that way, but they emphasized their belief in racial or gender differences in IQ or social behavior, and strongly rejected identity politics, affirmative action, and what they see as toxic political correctness. Their views shed light on how the alt-right has found a receptive audience on the margins, at least, of the tech world.  A former product manager for a top tech company who now consults for Twitter told me that white and Asian male domination in the tech sector has more to do with innate abilities and culture than discrimination. \"If you even try to posit that racism and sexism aren't why women and minorities aren't making it, that it's some combination of talent and values, people's heads just explode,\" he says. \"They just refuse to even float the idea.\"  \"I'm not necessarily saying any one race is bad,\" says \"Mark,\" a former software developer for Yahoo and Facebook. \"But we should at least agree that statistically, race and sex genes do make us differ enough on average to make things uneven in certain areas.\"  \"The history of nearly every field of science and engineering was driven by white Europeans,\" declares a 45-year-old computer chip designer who says he lives in Berkeley, California, and who posts under the name \"White Morpheus\" on the Daily Stormer. \"Nobody will say their real feelings [about the alt-right] because a mob of fat blue-hair complainers will drive you away from your career forever. Peter Thiel coming out [for Trump] was a joy to us all, because he could show his support for the Trump train where we could not.\"    In 1990, Ku Klux Klan \"Grand Dragon\" Don Black created Stormfront as a dial-up computer bulletin board for former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's campaign for Louisiana governor. By 1995 it had evolved into the first major public website dedicated to promoting white supremacy, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. But online hate speech mostly remained confined to its traditional base of neo-Nazis and Klansmen until the launch in 2003 of 4chan. Originally conceived as an anonymous message board for discussing Japanese anime and manga, 4chan attracted a cult following among techies at around the same time that its political discussion board, now known as /pol/ (short for \"politically incorrect\"), became a hotbed for racist jokes and ironically intended Hitler memes.  The political glue binding the predominately young, male 4chan community is essentially anti-leftist: a disdain for identity politics and so-called \"social justice warriors.\" This attitude thrives amid a culture of anonymity, in which status ostensibly comes from page views rather than one's gender, ethnic, or social background. \"Larry,\" a software engineer for Google and an alt-right fan, points to the infamous 4chan post, \"There Are No Girls on the Internet,\" where one 4channer profanely lectures another about how online life is a meritocracy in which gender should play no role.  Yet, hostility toward women and people of color thrives on 4chan and on Reddit, the social sharing site whose political and gaming forums /r/the_donald and /r/kotakuinaction are popular with the alt-right. In 2014, 4chan and Reddit users launched an elaborate campaign of rape and death threats against female video game developers that became known as Gamergate. They found champions in Yiannopoulos, who argued that the true victims were the men whose gaming culture was being destroyed by \"feminist bullies\" and the \"achingly politically correct\" tech press, and in Mike Cernovich, a blogger who has trumpeted the neuroticism and other alleged weaknesses of women as well as what he claims to be the criminal proclivities of certain ethnic groups. When former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao last year banned five \"harassing subreddits,\" including one called ShitNiggersSay, the move unleashed weeks of bigoted trolling (a.k.a. \"shitposting\") and digital vandalism on the siteand a migration to a Reddit copycat site, Voat. (More recently, similar migrations took place after Reddit banned /r/altright and discussion of the fake-news scandal #PizzaGate.)  The anonymity of 4chan and Reddit makes it impossible to tell the extent to which they are dominated by tech workers, though an abiding interest from the tech press suggests considerable overlap. \"It's definitely geek culture,\" says McGill University cultural anthropologist Gabriella Coleman, who has studied how 4chan gave rise to the hactivist group Anonymous. \"Clint,\" a Valley cybersecurity startup founder and longtime visitor to the site, told me that the majority of active users on 4chan/pol/ are in tech, though typically in lower-level system administrator and tech support jobs that come with a lot of downtime during the workday. Dale Beran, who recently wrote about the political history of 4chan, argues that techies have become less dominant as 4chan and similar sites have expanded, though they still play a role: \"We can define [4chan users] by their retreat into the computer, which means a lot of them have computer skillswhether that's networking or coding or whateverbut to some it may have simply been World of Warcraft.\"  \"Most contributions that built the internet came from white people,\" declares one notorious hacker.  Before Gamergate, Larry, the Google software engineer, was \"a standard Democrat straight-voting person,\" as he puts it. But reading about the movement in the tech press and on pro-Gamergate websites \"did highlight some of the inconsistencies and hypocrisies with positions on the left,\" he says. A comment in a Gamergate thread led Larry to the Unz Review, a website run by Palo Alto tech entrepreneur and former GOP gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz. There, Larry says he was exposed to treatises on \"human biological diversity\" expounding on the supposed cognitive differences between intellectually superior and inferior races.  Human biological diversity has also gained currency in the Valley through computer scientist Curtis Yarvin, who writes under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug. Starting in 2007, in series of blog posts often cited by alt-right followers, Yarvin laid out a political philosophy known as neoreaction or the \"Dark Enlightenment.\" Combining a technocratic sensibility with reactionary political thought, neoreaction rejects Enlightenment conceptssuch as democracy and equality of the races and sexesand instead advocates something much closer to authoritarianism. Yarvin believes government would work much better if run like a tech company and helmed by an all-powerful CEO president. He spoke admiringly of Napoleon, whom he considers to be \"kind of the Steve Jobs of France.\"  Yarvin's blog combines dorky programmer lingo with dense references to obscure, proto-fascist political texts. \"When I started blogging 10 years ago, the availability of completely unorthodox written content [online] was mostly confined to the pre-1923 corpus, which Google did such a nice job scanning,\" Yarvin told me in an email. He believes that software programmers are attracted to his writings because they \"are always looking for something to do with their restless, fidgety brains. Especially if it's weird and doesn't involve dealing with physical humans.\"  Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who reportedly gave Trump more than $1 million during the campaign and was an adviser on Trump's transition team, has circled neoreactionary ideas. \"I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,\" he wrote on the Cato Institute's blog in 2009, adding that women and \"welfare beneficiaries\" have through their voting habits \"rendered the notion of 'capitalist democracy' into an oxymoron\" (He clarified two weeks later that he supports women's suffrage and redirected blame for the supposed demise of democracy on \"unelected technocratic agencies.\")  Thiel is reportedly an investor in Yarvin's cloud computing company, though Yarvin told me that he and Thiel have never discussed neoreaction. Michael Anissimov, another well-known neoreactionary blogger, was formerly the media director of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which has received funding from the Thiel Foundation.  While a student at Stanford University in 1987, Thiel founded the conservative Stanford Review to inspire campus debate by \"presenting alternative viewpoints.\" In the 1995 book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, Thiel and former Stanford Review editor-in-chief David O. Sacks argued that multiculturalism at colleges was hurting education. In one bizarre passage, they speculated that some college date-rape cases were actually \"seductions that are later regretted\"a comment for which Thiel apologized last October, telling Forbes, \"Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise.\"  DeploraBall co-sponsor Jeff Giesea, also a former Stanford Review editor, worked for Thiel Capital Management in the late 1990s. Last year, Giesea partnered with far-right blogger Mike Cernovich on MAGA3X, a digital operation dedicated to waging meme warfare on behalf of Trump's campaign. Enlisting a network of pro-Trump Twitter influencers such as former BuzzFeed employee Anthime Gionet (a.k.a. Baked Alaska) and right-wing troll Jack Posobiec, the group spread Breitbart News content and memes based on conspiracy theories such as #SpiritCooking and #Pizzagate. The DeploraBall stirred controversy among the alt-right when Giesea and Cernovich decided to remove Gionet from their \"featured guests\" list after he posted several anti-Semitic tweets. But Giesea told me that he generally agrees with the views of alt-right fellow travelers such as Yiannopoulous. In January, he told BuzzFeed, \"I see Trumpism as the only practical and moral path to save Western civilization from itself.\"    In 2014, Jesse Jackson began pushing Silicon Valley tech companies to disclose statistics about the racial and gender composition of their workforces. By the following summer, he had pressured Google, Facebook, Apple, and many other major tech companies to reveal their paucity of black, Hispanic, and female employees and commit to making improvements. But when he appeared on Reddit that summer to answer questions about diversity in tech, he faced a virulent backlash. By far the most up-voted question began, \"You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter that has figured out how to manipulate the political system for your own gain.\"  The comment came from an anonymous account that was later deleted; few people in Silicon Valley are willing to question the value of diversity out in the open. \"If there was [opposition to diversity policy], it's probably something someone says to themselves in the car on the way home or on the bus on the way back to San Francisco,\" says Reed Galen, a GOP consultant who advises tech companies and has been trolled online by the alt-right over his criticism of Trump.  Chuck Johnson, who runs the pro-Trump site Got News from his home in Fresno, California, and claims to have received funding offers from wealthy tech investors, points to an obvious outlet for closeted alt-techies: \"A lot of these people see a sort of ostracism takes place [after they question the value of diversity], and they either rebel against it internally or they go online and they have a different identity and they shitpost on Reddit.\"  Several alt-techies I interviewed said they were fans of A Troublesome Inheritance, a national bestseller published in 2014 by former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade that makes a case for the existence of differences in average IQ and behavior between races. The book and others like it have been widely criticized by geneticists as misleading, overly speculative, and not based on scientific consensus, but the alt-techies claim such critiques are just political correctness. \"Nobody wants to touch it or admit it for fear of being branded alt-right,\" Mark, the Facebook engineer, told me.  \"Tomorrow, being a Hispanic, Black, Muslim or woman in the USA is going to be very scary,\" the Latino founder of a Silicon Valley startup wrote on Facebook on election night.  White supremacists see the historical dominance of Silicon Valley by white males as a reflection of the world's natural order. \"The reality is that for the vast majority of all human civilization, the majority of makers have been white,\" insists Andrew Auernheimer, a.k.a. Weev, a notorious troll and hacker who says he does tech support for the Daily Stormer and The Right Stuff. \"Most contributions that built the internet came from white people,\" he says, but now \"our contributions are essentially being stolen from us.\"  Alt-techies are scornful of South Asians working in Silicon Valley under H-1B visas. White Morpheus, the Daily Stormer reader, told me that he became a white supremacist after working with \"unqualified subcontinentals who were brought in by visa fraud to drive down American engineering wages\" and who \"produce subpar work product.\" (Before I contacted him, White Morpheus had posted on Daily Stormer about forming a neo-Nazi meetup group in Silicon Valley and using programming tools to create more video games \"like Angry Goy.\")  The H-1B visa program, which Trump has vowed to reform, is unpopular among many tech workers due to concerns about its effect on wages and job security. Studies have shown that the largest recipients of H-1B visas are outsourcing firms, and that H-1B workers get paid less money than their American counterparts for the same work. But hardcore racists see an opening to turn the H-1B debate into a recruitment tool in the Valley. \"A bill is being introduced in the House of Representatives that will neutralize the economic advantages these anti-American companies get from gaming the H1-b visa system,\" a contributor to the Daily Stormer wrote recently. \"If the cucks in Congress don't block it, the not-so-humanitarian motives of big business in browning and third-worldizing America will be revealed.\"    \"Tomorrow, being a Hispanic, Black, Muslim or woman in the USA is going to be very scary,\" the Latino founder of a Silicon Valley startup wrote on Facebook on election night. The post elicited an outpouring of solidarity from many Bay Area techiesbut not from Andrew Torba, an alum of the Y-Combinator tech incubator, who tweeted a screenshot of the post with the line \"Build the wall.\"  When other Y-Combinator graduates began criticizing Torba on Facebook, he waded into the fray: \"All of you: Fuck off,\" he wrote. \"Take your morally superior, elitist, virtue signaling bullshit and shove it.\" Using an alt-right term meant to demean mainstream conservatives, he added, \"I call it like I see it, and I helped meme a president into office, cucks.\"  Y-Combinator soon banned Torba from its alumni network for \"speaking in a threatening, harassing way towards other YC founders,\" in violation of its ethics policy. Torba denied threatening or harassing YC founders and called the ban \"a quintessential example of Silicon Valley censorship in action.\" He later turned down my request to speak with him about the incident by posting parts of my email to him on social media with the comment \"We don't interview with fake news sites.\"  Picking fights online may have helped Torba's startup Gab, a social-media network that quickly positioned itself as a haven for alt-right-ers banned from Twitter. Gab's frog logo is reminiscent of the alt-right mascot Pepe the Frog, and Torba has posted on Gab what could be construed as riffs on the Pepe hand signal and the alt-right's red-pill meme. (A Gab spokesman said Torba does not identify as part of the alt-right.) Trump's victory seemed to encourage other alt-techies to speak up, albeit pseudonymously.  \"What if some cultures are better?\" a commenter wrote a few days later on Y-Combinator's popular social forum, Hacker News. \"Why should we respect foreign cultures if they don't respect our own? Why should you lose your job if you make a joke in public that some people deem offensive? Why is racism against whites and sexism against men acceptable?\"  Another commenter on the thread chimed in: \"Based on the tone of the comments around here lately, I'm getting a sense that HN has been populated by closeted alt-right for a while now.\" (A few weeks later, Hacker News announced a \"political detox week\" in which political stories and threads were banned.)  A similar controversy has played out in recent months on Redditanother young, male techie-dominated siteas r/The_Donald has risen to become one of the site's most active subreddits. Its participants are notorious for trolling other Reddit communities and attacking people based on their religion, race, gender, and sexual identity, as Gizmodo's Bryan Menegus has documented. Citing two former Trump campaign officials, Politico's Ben Schreckinger recently reported that Trump's campaign team privately communicated last fall with r/The_Donald's most active users to seed new trends and feed catchy memes from the site back to Trump social-media director Dan Scavino.  The gaming vlogger Pewdiepie, whose YouTube channel is the world's largest, made rape jokes early in his career and sometimes uses the word \"slut\" as an insult. Since August, he has made nine videos featuring Nazi imagery or anti-Semitic humor, according to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal. (He later apologized but also said the Journal took the remarks out of context.) In a vlog posted in January that has been viewed more than 7 million times, he jokes about getting banned from Fiverr, a website where freelancers offer their services for $5, after hiring people to make a video of themselves holding a sign that said, \"DEATH TO ALL JEWS\"drawing kudos from neo-Nazis. In February, Disney's Maker Studios said it would no longer run PewDiePie's network and YouTube canceled the release of the second season of his reality show, Scare PewDiePie.  The alt-techies I spoke with remain aware of the risks of emerging further from the shadows. \"If I posted publicly about what I told you, I'd get fired,\" says Larry, the Google software engineer. \"Even with Trump, there is huge cultural inertia.\"", "date": "2017/03/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/silicon-valley-tech-alt-right-racism-misogyny", "title": "Meet Silicon Valley's Secretive Alt-Right Followers"}, {"text": "Terry Jones (left) an anti-Muslim pastor who burned a Quran in Florida in 2011.  The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in America tripled last year, according to a report released Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog organization that tracks political extremists. Between the beginning and end of 2016, the number of anti-Muslim groups increased from 34 to 101by far the largest spike since SPLC began tracking the category in 2010.  The surge coincides with a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes last year, a level of violence not seen since the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Documenting hate crimes is challenging (both in terms of legal definition and incidents that may go unreported), and most hate groups don't release membership statisticstwo reasons why SPLC views the number of anti-Muslim groups as an important metric.  Notably, the steady rise in these hate groups began around the launch in mid 2015 of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Though the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks from Paris to Orlando may have fueled some increase in Islamphobia, Trump's repeated invocation of the threat of \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and move as president to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries has clearly fanned the flames.  \"The rise in anti-Muslim groups in the last year I think demonstrates just how much the presidential campaign influenced the radical right in the US,\" says Ryan Lenz, a senior writer for the SPLC's Intelligence Project. \"We have not seen this level of anti-Muslim rhetoric in quite some time, and Trump has done the lion's share of infusing the anti-Muslim movement in the US with energy, which had been waning for years.\"  Breitbart News, the far-right publication formerly led by Trump senior strategist Stephen Bannon, has written dozens of stories about Muslim \"rape gangs,\" the supposed threat of Sharia law in the United States, and alleged conspiracies by the Council on Islamic Relations, a moderate civil rights organization that Breitbart characterizes as a \"front group\" for terrorists.  Until stepping down from Brietbart News in August 2015 to lead the Trump campaign, Bannon hosted a Sirius XM radio show, Breitbart News Daily, where he conducted dozens of interviews with anti-Muslim extremists. One of Bannon's guests on the show, Trump surrogate Roger Stone, warned of a future America \"where hordes of Islamic madmen are raping, killing, pillaging, defecating in public fountains, harassing private citizens, elderly peoplethat's what's coming.\"  Bannon also said on his show that George W. Bush's statement after 9/11 that \"Islam is peace\" was \"the dumbest\" comment Bush made during his presidency. Bannon told listeners that the United States and Europe are engaged in a \"global existential war\" and suggested that a \"fifth column\" of Islamist sympathizers has infiltrated the US government.  Since his election, Trump has tapped several leaders with track records marked by anti-Muslim views. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's now ex-national security adviser, has described Islam as a \"malignant cancer\" and tweeted that \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\" As a student at Duke University, senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller co-founded the Terrorism Awareness Project, which promoted \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week.\" And Trump's CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, has embraced apocalyptic views of Islam.", "date": "2017/02/15", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/anti-muslim-groups-america-tripled-alongside-trump", "title": "Anti-Muslim Hate Groups Have Tripled With the Rise of Trump"}, {"text": "Conway with White House strategist Steve Bannon in late January  Late Monday, coming off a long evening of responding to Gen. Mike Flynn's resignation as national security adviser, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway found solace in a tweet from a user named Lib Hypocrisy:  Conway not only retweeted the message but also wrote, \"Love you back,\" and wished her \"Hapless Haters\" a happy Valentine's Day.  But there was just one problem: Lib Hypocrisy is an explicit promoter of white nationalism and other bigotry. This is evident from the account's profile, which includes the hashtags \"#WhiteIdentity\" and \"#Nationalist.\" It features a cartoon image connoting Pepe the Frog, the adopted mascot of the racist \"alt-right\" movement, and a shout-out to Geert Wilders, the far-right Dutch politician who wants to shut down mosques.  These are some of Lib Hypocrisy's recent tweets and retweets:  Asked about her retweet of Lib Hypocisy by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, Conway implied that she hadn't been in control of her account at the time. She said she \"obviously\" had no idea who Lib Hypocrisy was, adding, \"I denounce whoever it is.\" The tweets were soon deleted.  Conway's move continues a long-standing pattern of Trump and his inner circle engaging with white nationalists and then claiming ignorance when confronted about itas Mother Jones documented in multiple investigations since last summer. Other such \"mistakes\" include:  Trump failing to disavow support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke when asked about it repeatedly on CNN, and then blaming a \"bad earpiece.\"  Trump appointing a white nationalist leader as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and then blaming a \"database error\" for the move.  Trump tweeting an image of himself superimposed over a picture of WWII-era Waffen-SS soldiers, and then blaming a mistake by an intern.  Gen. Michael Flynn sharing a #NeverHillary tweet that said, \"Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore,\" and then claiming it was a mistake.  Those are just the cases in which Trump and his backers have backpedaled. There are many other similar instances in which they haven't even bothered to explain or apologize:  Trump twice retweeting @WhiteGenocideTM  Trump retweeting @EustaceFash, whose header image at the time also included the term \"White Genocide.\"  Trump tweeting an image of himself as Pepe the frog  Trump tweeting an image of \"Crooked Hillary\" superimposed over a pile of cash and the Star of David  Donald Trump Jr.'s infamous Skittles tweet  Trump tweeting blatantly false and racially inflammatory crime statistics  The most charitable interpretation of this behavior is ineptitude.

If you've ever purchased pre-cut produce at Costco or Safeway, or eaten at fast-food restaurants such as McDonalds or Chipotle, chances are that your food was handled by workers at Taylor Farms. As one of the world's largest fresh-cut produce companies, it employs hundreds of low-wage workers in several warehouses in and around California's Central Valley. These are the people who dice the lettuce in your burger and mince the cilantro in your burrito.  Fresh-cut produce suppliers allow restaurant chains to reduce labor costs and ensure that their foods are prepared under sterile conditions. In response to E. coli outbreaks in 2015, Chipotle announced that it would stop dicing tomatoes in its restaurants; like many other fast-food chains, it now sources some of that prep work from Taylor Farms.  OSHA issued the company 55 violations and fined it more than $100,000, but Taylor Farms is contesting the violations.  But these massive warehouses carry risks of their own. To prevent E. coli and salmonella outbreaks, fresh-cut produce firms treat their vegetables with chlorine and use other cleaning chemicals that sometimes can pose hazards to workers.  Since 2012, two separate chemical accidents at a Taylor Farms plant in California have sent some 40 workers to the hospital. During that time, California's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued the company 55 violations and fined it more than $100,000 for problems that included failure to monitor workers' chemical exposures, failure to notify workers of what they may be exposed to on the job, and failure to train workers properly. Inspectors found that Taylor Farms repeatedly \"failed to control production area employee exposure to chlorine so as to prevent harmful effects such as significant eye, nose, and lung irritation, vomiting, nose bleeds, and fainting.\" Taylor Farms is contesting these violations and many of the others.  Partly in response to the persistent safety problems, workers at Taylor Farms' plant in Tracy are trying to unionize. But the company has fought back aggressively. The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Taylor Farms, citing dozens of alleged violations of federal labor law, including spying on, threatening, and firing pro-union workers. (The company and its contractors, without admitting fault, settled the case for $267,000.)  Last August, Taylor Farms workers protested outside Albertsons grocery stories, holding signs that said, \"Taylor Farms Makes Bad Salads.\" A group of workers from the Tracy plant also traveled to San Francisco to hold a protest outside a Chipotle restaurant. Among them was Maria Leon, then a 32-year-old mother of four who worked chopping vegetables. Leon, who was pregnant at the time of the incident, told me the following story, which I've corroborated with other workers and edited for length and clarity:  I work at a conveyor beltthey call it the prep line. The vegetables arrive whole. We cut the bell peppers in half and take out the seeds. We take the rubber bands off of cilantro and green onions. We take off the roots, we take off the tips. We cut them and we pack them. For all of this we just use knives.  It's very coldlike 33 or 34 degrees. To stay warm, we wear three or four sweaters or very heavy coats. The broccoli and green lettuce comes packed in ice and we have to take it out. We put on three gloves, one of plastic, one of fabric, and one made of metal. But it's still cold.  They use the chemicals in the water to sterilize the vegetables and to wash the machines. The air everywhere in the plant has the smell. This is one of the worst things about the job. There's one chemical that reacts with our eyes. They don't use it on the prep line, but they do use it in other areas where practically every day people come into contact with it.  On October 15, I punched in and entered the production room where I work. I smelled a very strong odor. I arrived at my line and told the crew leader, \"I'm going to leave.\" I went across the room. About four minutes later, he came over and suggested that I try wearing a paper mask and return to the line. Because I was pregnant, I'd sometimes had nausea and vomiting, so I didn't know if that was why I was feeling bad. So I put on the mask and I went to work.  It bothered me to go in there. It hurt too much. But none of my coworkers were saying anything. Then people started getting sick. After about 10 minutes, a crew leader opened a door and said, \"Please go outside. Go outside.\"  There weren't alarms that sounded, they didn't say leave immediately. The only people who even remotely knew what was going on were the crew leaders, who carry radios with earpieces. The crew leaders told people what to do, but there were many people who couldn't hear them, who work alone. In the beginning, they had no way to know that it was an emergency and they should leave.  I felt dizzy and nauseous. Others were coughing. Others had blood coming out of their noses. It was maybe 25 minutes before the ambulances arrived.  The paramedics told me I had too many chemicals on me and they took off all my clothes. When I arrived at the hospital, the doctors ordered me to bathe. They washed me off because they said I smelled too strongly of chemicals. I think they did this as a precaution because I was pregnant.  I asked the doctor about my baby. We still don't know what will happen. I did the studies with the doctor and everything is fine up until now, but she could develop asthma or respiratory problems. I hope nothing will happen. [Update: The baby was born healthy and so far hasn't experienced any significant problems.]  I don't know much about the chemicals they use. I'm not responsible for that. Sometimes the odor is a little stronger, sometimes it's less. People are afraid of breathing it, but they don't protest. They will say you don't have papers. That's what the workers think. Everybody is afraid.  \"People often ask me, 'What are you doing there?' But I need to work because I am a single mother.\"  People often ask me, \"What are you doing there?\" But I need to work because I am a single mother. I have three other girls: eight, nine, and 13 years old.  We don't have set hours. My line begins at 5:20 a.m. We could be finished at one, or at three, or at five. There's no normal day. If they want to, they can keep you for more than 12 hours.  Right now they pay $10.50 an hour, 50 cents more than minimum wage. It depends on the hours, but in a typical week we might make $470. It's difficult at this wage. It's good that the father of my children is helping me with the girls, because otherwise what I earn at Taylor wouldn't be enough.  I don't think people who shop at Chipotle or Costco would do so if they knew what was going on. The working people, at this wage, they say what does it matter if the product goes out well? If you don't take an interest in us, then we could care less about you.  If we had a union, maybe they would pay us better and create a plan so that we aren't breathing chemicals. We hope that they can stop thinking of us like we are machines. The chemicals don't hurt the machines but they do hurt us. Machines can work without a decent wage, but we can't.  Respect above all is what we need.  Contacted by Mother Jones, Taylor Farms owner Bruce Taylor said that his company had officially contested the OSHA and NLRB citations. He also disputed many of Leon's claims. The company's third-party consultant routinely tests air quality inside the plant and hasn't found any problems, he said, and the level of chemical exposure resulting from the October accident was akin to what you'd get from \"swimming in your swimming pool.\" (The OSHA documents suggest otherwise.) Taylor said Leon's claims about being pressured to work on the day of the accident \"were thoroughly investigated and determined to be baseless,\" and he insisted that crew leaders did a good job communicating the need to evacuate. (Citing OSHA appeals, he would not provide immediate access to the company's consultant or paperwork from its internal investigation.) The plant has an alarm for chemical spills, he said, and its overall safety record is above average, with no lost time or injuries since the beginning of the year.  The typical entry-level Taylor Farms worker makes $25,000 to $35,000 a year, Taylor said. Overtime is voluntary: \"We have a great relationship with our people, and we try to make sure we take care of them.\" The Chipotle protest, he added, was simply an effort to \"blackmail\" his company into signing a union deal.", "date": "2017/02/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/05/taylor-farms-chipotle-mcdonalds-fresh-cut-produce-labor-violations", "title": "Some of the People Prepping Produce for Your Fast Food Aren't Too Happy With Their Working Conditions"}, {"text": "Senior Trump advisers Stephen Bannon (left) and Stephen Miller  The Trump administration has insisted since Sunday that the president's executive order banning travel to the United States from seven predominately Islamic countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" But as Mother Jones first reported in a series of investigations starting last summer, the two top Trump advisers who reportedly crafted the immigration crackdownStephen Bannon and Stephen Millerhave a long history of promoting Islamophobia, courting anti-Muslim extremists, and boosting white nationalists.  For nearly a year before stepping down as the CEO of Breitbart News to lead the Trump campaign, Bannon hosted a SiriusXM radio show, Breitbart News Daily, where he conducted dozens of interviews with leading anti-Muslim extremists. Steeped in unfounded claims and conspiracy theories, the interviews paint a dark and paranoid picture of America's 3.3 million Muslims and the world's second-largest faith. Bannon often bookended the exchanges with full-throated praise for his guests, describing them as \"top experts\" and urging his listeners to click on their websites and support them.  One of Bannon's guests on the show, Trump surrogate Roger Stone, warned of a future America \"where hordes of Islamic madmen are raping, killing, pillaging, defecating in public fountains, harassing private citizens, elderly peoplethat's what's coming.\"  Another frequent guest was Pamela Geller, the president of Stop Islamization of America, whom Bannon described as \"one of the top world experts on radical Islam and Sharia law and Islamic supremacism.\" Geller told Bannon that George W. Bush's description of Islam as a \"religion of peace\" was something \"we all deplore,\" that there had been an \"infiltration\" of the Obama administration by radical Muslims, and that former Central Intelligence Director John Brennan may have secretly converted to Islam. Bannon never pushed back against any of those unfounded claims.  In other exchanges on the show, Bannon described the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group that defends the rights of Muslims, as \"a bunch of spin\" and \"a bunch of lies.\" He accused the mainstream media of \"basically going along the lines of being Sharia-compliant on blasphemy laws.\" He warned of \"Sharia courts taking over Texas\" and said that he opened a Breitbart News bureau in London in order to combat \"all these Sharia courts [that] were starting under British law.\"  Bannon has lauded Miller, who previously worked for Sen. Jeff Sessions. \"Whether the issue was trade or immigration or radical Islam, for many years before Donald Trump came on the scene, Sen. Sessions was the leader of the movement and Stephen was his right-hand man,\" Bannon told Politico in June.  As a member of the Duke Conservative Union, Miller worked closely with Richard Spencer, a Ph.D. student who would later coin the term \"alt-right\" and become a leading white nationalist.  Miller has long been an advocate of framing the fight against terrorism in religious terms. In 2007, while an undergraduate at Duke University, he started the Terrorism Awareness Project, an effort to make \"students aware of the Islamic jihad and the terrorist threat, and to mobilize support for the defense of America and the civilization of the West.\" The group promoted \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week\" on college campuses and took out ads in college newspapers titled, \"What Americans Need to Know About Jihad.\" After many papers declined to run the ads, Miller appeared on Fox & Friends to discuss the controversy, saying, \"How are we going to win a war on terror if we can't even talk about the enemy?\"  As a member of the Duke Conservative Union, Miller worked closely with Richard Spencer, a Ph.D. student who would later coin the term \"alt-right\" and become a leading white nationalist. Spencer told me that at Duke, Miller helped him with fundraising and promotion for an on-campus debate on immigration policy that Spencer organized in 2007, featuring influential white nationalist Peter Brimelow. Miller vehemently denied to me that he had any connection to Spencer or his ideas, but another former member of the Duke Conservative Union confirmed to me that Miller and Spencer worked together on the Brimelow event. And at DCU meetings, according to another past member of the group, Miller denounced multiculturalism and expressed concerns that immigrants from non-European countries were not assimilating.  Last July, Bannon boasted to Mother Jones during the Republican National Convention that Breitbart News was \"the platform for the alt-right.\" The site regularly publishes anti-Muslim content; since Sunday, Breitbart has defended the new Trump policy crafted by its old boss, including with a piece headlined \"Terror-Tied Group CAIR Causing Chaos, Promoting Protests & Lawsuits as Trump Protects Nation.\"", "date": "2017/01/30", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/stephen-bannon-miller-trump-refugee-ban-islamophobia-white-nationalist", "title": "The Dark History of the White House Aides Who Crafted Trump's \"Muslim Ban\""}, {"text": "It's almost as if the man who once ran for the White House himself were taking a stand as a kind of alternative president. In his annual State of the State address on Tuesday, California Gov. Jerry Brown reiterated a vision for the nation's most populous state that was thoroughly at odds with the Trump administration. He pledged to continue inking California's own climate agreements with other states and countries, to fight for the Affordable Care Act, and to \"defend everybodyevery man, woman, and childwho has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state.\"  Expanding upon recent vows to counter Trump's agenda, Brown took aim at the administration's \"bald assertion of 'alternative facts'\" and \"blatant attacks on science.\" He lamented that the \"familiar signposts of our democracytruth, civility, working togetherhave been swept aside.\" But he maintained that California could serve as a powerful bulwark: \"We must prepare for uncertain times and reaffirm the basic principles that have made California the Great Exception that it is.\"  \"When we defend California,\" Brown said, \"we defend America.\"  Here's the full text of the speech:  Thank you. Thank you for all that energy and enthusiasm. It is just what we need for the battle ahead. So keep it up and don't ever falter.    This is California, the sixth most powerful economy in the world. One out of every eight Americans lives right here and 27 percent  almost eleven million  were born in a foreign land.    When California does well, America does well. And when California hurts, America hurts. [In the delivered version of the speech, Brown added: \"When we defend California, we defend America.\"]    As the English poet, John Donne, said almost 400 years ago:    \"No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main_And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\"    A few moments ago, I swore into office our new attorney general. Like so many others, he is the son of immigrants who saw California as a place where, through grit and determination, they could realize their dreams. And they are not alone, millions of Californians have come here from Mexico and a hundred other countries, making our state what it is today: vibrant, even turbulent, and a beacon of hope to the rest of the world.    We don't have a Statue of Liberty with its inscription: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free_\" But we do have the Golden Gate and a spirit of adventure and openness that has welcomed  since the Gold Rush of 1848  one wave of immigration after another.    For myself, I feel privileged to stand before you as your governor, as did my father almost sixty years ago. His mother, Ida, the youngest of eight children, was born in very modest circumstances, not very far from where we are gathered today. Her father arrived in California in 1852, having left from the Port of Hamburg, aboard a ship named \"Perseverance.\"    It is that spirit of perseverance and courage which built our state from the beginning. And it is that spirit which will get us through the great uncertainty and the difficulties ahead.    It is customary on an occasion like this to lay out a specific agenda for the year ahead. Six times before from this rostrum, I have done that, and in some detail. And, as I reread those proposals set forth in previous State of the State speeches, I was amazed to see how much we have accomplished together.    We have:    Increased  by tens of billions  support for our public schools and universities.  Provided health insurance to over five million more Californians.  Raised the minimum wage.  Reduced prison overcrowding and reformed our system of crime and punishment.  Made California a world leader in the fight against climate change.  Passed a water bond.  Built up a rainy day fund.  And closed a huge $27 billion deficit.    And during the last seven years, California has reduced the unemployment rate from 12.1 percent to 5.2 percent and created almost 2.5 million jobs. And that's not all.    But this morning it is hard for me to keep my thoughts just on California. The recent election and inauguration of a new President have shown deep divisions across America.    While no one knows what the new leaders will actually do, there are signs that are disturbing. We have seen the bald assertion of \"alternative facts.\" We have heard the blatant attacks on science. Familiar signposts of our democracy truth, civility, working together  have been obscured or swept aside.    But on Saturday, in cities across the country, we also witnessed a vast and inspiring fervor that is stirring in the land. Democracy doesn't come from the top; it starts and spreads in the hearts of the people. And in the hearts of Americans, our core principles are as strong as ever.    So as we reflect on the state of our state, we should do so in the broader context of our country and its challenges. We must prepare for uncertain times and reaffirm the basic principles that have made California the Great Exception that it is.    First, in California, immigrants are an integral part of who we are and what we've become. They have helped create the wealth and dynamism of this state from the very beginning.    I recognize that under the Constitution, federal law is supreme and that Washington determines immigration policy. But as a state we can and have had a role to play. California has enacted several protective measures for the undocumented: the Trust Act, lawful driver's licenses, basic employment rights and non-discriminatory access to higher education.    We may be called upon to defend those laws and defend them we will. And let me be clear: we will defend everybody  every man, woman and child  who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state.    My second point relates to health care. More than any other state, California embraced the Affordable Care Act and over five million people now enjoy its benefits. But that coverage has come with tens of billions of federal dollars. Were any of that to be taken away, our state budget would be directly affected, possibly devastated. That is why I intend to join with other governors  and with you  to do everything we can to protect the health care of our people.    Third, our state is known the world over for the actions we have taken to encourage renewable energy and combat climate change.    Whatever they do in Washington, they can't change the facts. And these are the facts: the climate is changing, the temperatures are rising and so are the oceans. Natural habitats everywhere are under increasing stress. The world knows this.    One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal  the \"Under Two M.O.U.\"  has 165 signatories, representing a billion people.    We cannot fall back and give in to the climate deniers. The science is clear. The danger is real.    We can do much on our own and we can join with others  other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And we will.    Fourth is infrastructure. This is a topic where the President has stated his firm intention to build and build big.    In his inaugural address, he said: \"We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.\"    And in this, we can all work together  here in Sacramento and in Washington as well. We have roads and tunnels and railroads and even a dam that the President could help us with. And that will create good-paying American jobs.    As we face the hard journey ahead, we will have to summon, as Abraham Lincoln said, \"the better angels of our nature.\" Above all else, we have to live in the truth.    We all have our opinions but for democracy to work, we have to trust each other. We have to strive to understand the facts and state them clearly as we argue our points of view. As Hugo Grotius, the famous Dutch jurist, said long ago, \"even God cannot cause two times two not to make four.\"    When the science is clear or when our own eyes tell us that the seats in this chamber are filled or that the sun is shining, we must say so, not construct some alternate universe of non-facts that we find more pleasing.    Along with truth, we must practice civility. Although we have disagreed  often along party lines  we have generally been civil to one another and avoided the rancor of Washington. I urge you to go even further and look for new ways to work beyond party and act as Californians first.    Democrats are in the majority, but Republicans represent real Californians too. We went beyond party when we reformed workers' compensation, when we created a rainy day fund and when we passed the water bond.    Let's do that again and set an example for the rest of the country. And, in the process, we will earn the trust of the people of California.    And then there is perseverance. It is not an accident that the sailing ship that brought my great-grandfather to America was named \"Perseverance.\" That is exactly what it took to endure the dangerous and uncertain months at sea, sailing from Germany to America.    While we now face different challenges, make no mistake: the future is uncertain and dangers abound. Whether it's the threat to our budget, or to undocumented Californians, or to our efforts to combat climate change  or even more global threats such as a financial meltdown or a nuclear incident or terrorist attack  this is a time which calls out for courage and for perseverance. I promise you both.    But let's remember as well that after the perilous voyage, those who made it to America found boundless opportunity. And so will we.    Let me end in the immortal words of Woody Guthrie:    \"This land is your land, this land is my land  From California to the New York Island  From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters  This land was made for you and me...    Nobody living can ever stop me,  As I go walking that freedom highway;  Nobody living can ever make me turn back  This land was made for you and me.\"  California is not turning back. Not now, not ever.", "date": "2017/01/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/jerry-brown-california-trump-alternative-facts-climate-immigration", "title": "Jerry Brown Blasts Trump's \"Alternate Universe of Non-Facts\""}, {"text": "A rally on November 10 in San Francisco.  Here in America's most populous state, the wealthy pay the nation's highest income tax rate, the minimum wage will soon rise to $15 an hour statewide, more than a quarter of the population is foreign born, and the economy is booming. California, the world's sixth-largest economy and a bastion of progressivism, is now being hailed as a kind of great blue firewallDemocrats' most important bulwark against the retrograde policies of Donald Trump.  \"If you want to take on a forward-leaning state that is prepared to defend its rights and interests, then come at us,\" Xavier Becerra, the state's incoming attorney general, taunted the president-elect in December.  \"One thing that should be made very clear is that one election won't change the values of the state of California,\" Kevin de Le_n, the Senate president pro tempore, told Mother Jones. \"What we would say to the incoming Trump administration is that we hope you find value in what we do in Californiaby growing the economy, creating real jobs that can be verified, reducing our carbon footprint, respecting immigrants for who they are, and recognizing that diversity, a rich mosaic of different hues, is actually a strength, not a weakness.\"  Soon after Trump announced Cabinet nominees that \"confirmed our worst fears about what a Trump presidency would look like,\" says de Le_n, he and his colleagues in the Statehouse retained former US Attorney General Eric Holder to advise on potential legal challenges from the next White House. \"He brings a lot of legal firepower to do everything within our power to protect the policies, people, and progressive values of California.\"  In a state where Democrats control all statewide elected offices and a supermajority of the Legislature, the economy grew 4.1 percent in 2015the fastest in the country and nearly double the national average. Since 2011, when Democrat Jerry Brown replaced Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor, the state has turned a $26 billion budget deficit into a surplus that is projected to include upward of $8 billion for a rainy-day fund by the end of 2017. California has leveraged its booming economy to expand social services; since 2014, it has increased its budget for child care and preschool for low-income children by 24 percent, to $3.7 billion.  Trump's bigoted rhetoric and alignment with far-right extremists during the presidential campaign alienated many people in California, which boasts an economy that in many ways is defined by immigrant labor, global free trade, and a progressive regulatory regime. A push to deport undocumented farmworkers could hurt the state's agricultural sector. The green-energy sector fears a loss of subsidies and more drilling, maybe even in pristine federally protected waters just off the coast. Silicon Valley is suspicious of Trump on cybersecurity, trade protectionism, and the import of highly skilled tech workers. And then there is Hollywood: Meryl Streep's condemnation of Trump at the Golden Globes this month underscored a deep antipathy for the president-elect among celebrities, many of whom have declined to perform at his inauguration.  But California's leaders aren't just engaging in a rhetorical war on Trump. Here's what the Golden State is already doing to counter the president-elect on a range of major issues and defend its progressive achievements.    Climate Change  Trump famously suggested global warming is a Chinese hoax and has vowed to \"cancel\" the Paris Accord committing nearly every nation to curb emissions. His pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is a climate change denier best known for suing the EPA in an effort to overturn its clean-energy policies. A darling of oil and coal interests, Pruitt has vowed as EPA chief to fight \"unnecessary regulations\" and promote \"freedom for American business.\"  But even if the Trump administration works to pull America back toward its carbon-spewing past, it will have little impact in California, which last year enacted a bill requiring the state to slash greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Recently, Gov. Brown and other state leaders said they would bypass Trump and work directly with other nations and states to reduce emissions; California already trades emissions credits with Quebec, and in 2013 the state inked a pact with China committing to joint efforts to combat climate change and support clean energythe only such agreement China has signed with a subnational government.  California already plays a major role in protecting the nation's air quality.  California plays a unique role in setting national energy policy: Section 209 of the Clean Air Act allows California, but not other states, to set its own stricter-than-federal emissions standards for automobiles if they address \"compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" Other states are then allowed to adopt those regulations. To date, 10 other states, representing 40 percent of the US population, have signed on to California's tighter efficiency and emissions rules for cars, appliances, and automobiles. \"The California standard actually governs in many cases rather than the federal standard,\" notes Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco, \"because nobody wants to make two product lines.\"  California plays a less decisive role in directly supporting environmental sciences and energy research, which depend heavily on federal support, but Brown has signaled a desire to step in if Trump pulls the plug. \"We've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight,\" Brown said at the American Geophysical Union Conference in San Francisco. He even suggested that if Trump follows through on some advisers' ambitions to end NASA's role in climate science, California could step in and \"launch its own damn satellite.\"    Immigration  Though Trump campaigned on the idea of deporting America's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, he has more recently said he will focus first on deporting 2 million to 3 million immigrants with criminal recordsa number that would presumably include many people who've committed minor infractions. (Only about 820,000 undocumented immigrants have been convicted of crimes, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.) But pursuing mass deportations in California won't be easy. A 2014 law bans state authorities from holding immigrants convicted of minor crimes for any longer than required by criminal law, thereby protecting them from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation. Many California cities have even broader \"sanctuary city\" policies.  \"To the millions of undocumented residents pursuing and contributing to the California Dream, the state of California will be your wall of justice.\"  Last month, state legislators introduced a package of bills that would go even further: Legislation authored by de Le_n would bar state and local authorities from enforcing immigration laws, limit records sharing with federal immigration officials, and create \"safe zones\" at schools, hospitals, and courthouses where immigration enforcement would be prohibited. \"To the millions of undocumented residents pursuing and contributing to the California Dream, the state of California will be your wall of justice should the incoming administration adopt an inhumane and overreaching mass-deportation policy,\" de Le_n said last month.  Other proposed bills would subsidize immigrant legal services by training public defenders in immigration law and setting up a fund to cover legal bills for immigrants caught up in deportation proceedings. Studies have shown that immigrants with a lawyer are far more likely to succeed in challenging deportation proceedings. Los Angeles last month announced a $10 million immigrant legal fund; the San Francisco Public Defender's Office has proposed a similar $5 million fund.  More than a quarter of immigrants in the United States illegally live in California. In 1994, voters approved Proposition 187, a ballot measure making undocumented immigrants ineligible for public benefits. But since then, the state has moved sharply in the other direction. In 2011, Brown signed the California DREAM Act, allowing Californians who came to the country illegally when they were children to apply for financial aid from state colleges. In 2013, California allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, qualify for in-state tuition, and obtain law and other professional licenses. Last year, the state expanded its California-only Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program to undocumented children.  Anticipating that the Trump administration could use records collected through such programs to identify and round up undocumented immigrants, the American Civil Liberties Union is pushing for further safeguards here. \"We're concerned about ensuring that information is protected and can remain confidential,\" says Jennie Pasquarella, the director of immigrant rights for the ACLU of California. \"It is critical that California first show a model for the rest of the countryour values as a state that is filled with immigrants.\" California's Kamala Harris announced earlier this month that her first act as a US senator would be to co-sponsor legislation to protect the nation's 744,000 \"DREAMers\" from deportation.    Health Care  Republicans and Trump have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Actbut in California the law is overwhelmingly popular and successful. The law has provided $20 billion for the Medi-Cal program and for insurance subsidies for 1.2 million Californians, helping to cut the state's uninsured rate by half, from 6.5 million people in 2012 to 3.3 million in 2015. Patient advocacy groups don't want to give up those gains. In December, the California Endowment announced that it would spend $25 million over three years to defend against federal cuts to Obamacare and other social programs. \"California has made great progress both economically and on the health front over the past several years,\" says Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the Endowment's Healthy California program. \"We think it is important to defend that from threats in Washington.\"  Several California leaders are even pushing Trump to replace Obamacare with \"Medicare for All,\" a.k.a. single-payer health care. \"The one I am counting on the most [to push nationalized health care] is Trump,\" RoseAnn DeMoro, the head of the Oakland-based National Nurses United union, told Politico, citing Trump's \"international perspective\" as a businessman and the fact that his wife comes from Slovenia, which has a single-payer system. Another major backer of \"Medicare for All\" is California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who as mayor of San Francisco in 2007 launched Healthy San Francisco, a health care plan available to all city residents regardless of their immigration status, employment, or preexisting conditions.    Marijuana  Trump's pick for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, last year killed a bipartisan bill that would have reduced prison sentences for some lower-level drug offenders. He said last April that \"good people don't smoke marijuana\" and that \"we need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.\"  Attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions said last April that \"good people don't smoke marijuana.\"  Though Sessions moderated that rhetoric during his confirmation hearing this week, his nomination is staunchly opposed by California's $3 billion legal marijuana industry and its representatives in Washington. Sessions has a long history of opposing marijuana reform, and nothing he said at the hearing suggests he has changed his mind,\" Bill Piper, senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance's Office of National Affairs, said in a press release. The DPA was a major backer of November's successful California Proposition 64, which legalizes recreational marijuana.  In an echo of the Proposition 64 campaign, drug policy reform groups have partnered with civil rights groups such as the NAACP and LatinoJustice to oppose Sessions on the grounds that the war on drugs has fueled mass incarcerations of people of color for nonviolent offenses. They want to make sure Trump stands by his 2015 statement to the Washington Post that marijuana legalization \"should be a state issue.\"  Marijuana industry leaders expect California to vigorously defend Proposition 64 from any federal court challenges. \"We would expect a very, very strong pushback from the state, because the reality is its a public safety issue,\" Nate Bradley, executive director of the California Cannabis Industry Association, told the Los Angeles Times. \"They have decriminalized a product, so if you dont allow any sort of regulation in place for people to access that product, the underground market is only going to grow.\"    Guns  Enthusiastically endorsed by the National Rifle Association, Trump has vowed to diminish federal gun regulations, including eliminating gun-free zones at schools and on military bases, and he supports a national right-to-carry law for concealed guns. During the presidential campaign he also suggested he would appoint an explicitly anti-gun-control justice to the US Supreme Court.  \"The reduction of our state's gun violence rate is a model for the nation,\" says Lt. Governor Newsom, who vows to fight any efforts \"to make California a Wild West again.\"  But California this year further strengthened its gun laws, which were already among the toughest in the nation. In July, Brown signed off on legislation that outlawed the possession of ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, required background checks for the purchase of ammunition, and banned the sale of certain types of semi-automatic assault rifles. Proposition 63, approved by voters in November, added requirements for owners to report lost and stolen guns and created a system for confiscating guns from felons.  \"The United States is a federal republic, not a monarchy, and California plays an outsized role in our nations success,\" Lt. Governor Newsom, the architect of Proposition 63, said in a statement to Mother Jones. \"The reduction of our state's gun violence rate is a model for the nation and we're resilient, flexible, and well prepared for any effort by the NRA and the President-elect to make California a Wild West again.\"    One place where California hasn't pushed back much against Trump since the election is Silicon Valley. A few rank-and-file tech workers have held meetings with civil rights groups, but tech CEOs have quietly sidled up to the president-elect. A few weeks ago, a handful of top tech names climbed Trump Tower for an awkward photo op with Trump and his children. We definitely gave up a little stature now for possible benefit later,\" one source told Recode's Kara Swisher at the time. \"It's better to be quiet now and speak up later if we have to, and save our powder.\"  The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, which defends free speech and privacy on the internet, took out a full-page advertisement in Wired magazine in December, warning the technology community, \"Your threat model has changed.\" The ad calls upon tech companies to secure their networks against an incoming Trump administration by encrypting user data, scrubbing data logs, and disclosing government data requests while fighting them in court.  \"For California, Trump is creating a lot of fronts where organizations and government are going to be fighting battles,\" says Dave Maass, an investigative researcher at EFF. \"We are focused on civil liberties and privacy, and we believe they are fundamental to whatever kind of activism battle that you want to fight. If you don't have free speech and don't have the ability to organize, then you can't do anything.\" He anticipates that California lawmakers will be generating a flurry of new bills, and that no small number of them \"are going to be direct responses to Trump.\"", "date": "2017/01/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/california-trump-immigration-climate-healthcare-marijuana-guns-tech", "title": "California Mobilizes for War Against Trump"}, {"text": "Is Donald Trump a threat to democracy?

Puzder's confirmation hearing, delayed weeks due to his failure to submit required financial and ethics paperwork, was set for Thursday.  With his nomination facing stiff opposition from labor groups, Puzder had been bleeding support in recent days. On Wednesday, Mother Jones published details of some of the 39 labor violation claims that have been brought against his company, CKE, which owns both Hardee's and Carl's Jr. Also on Wednesday, Politico obtained and published video of a 1990 episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, in which Puzder's ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, wore a disguise and claimed he abused her. (Winfrey handed over the tape at the request of senators.)  Earlier in the day, National Review tried to get ahead of the nomination's impending collapse by opposing it on immigration grounds. But as MoJo's Kevin Drum noted, it was probably just to change the narrative.  Well, it turns out he's soft on immigration: he supports comprehensive immigration reform rather than walls and high-profile raids. Can't have that. And just by coincidence, NR's opposition comes shortly after we learned that Puzder \"employed an undocumented housekeeper for several years and failed to pay related taxes.\" I don't think NR actually cares about that, though. They only care that it gives Democrats a hook to fire up the opposition. Why give them a victory that will just make them even smugger than usual? Might as well pull the plug now and pretend that it was all because conservatives have such high moral standards.

Two sources tell CNN Michael Flynn has resigned as National Security Adviser.  Dianne Gallagher (@DianneG) February 14, 2017  The resignation capped a day of political turmoil for Flynn and the White House. Just hours earlier, all 17 Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform signed a letter demanding a full investigation of Flynn's alleged discussions of sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the US during the month before President Trump took office.  The White House took contradictory positions on Flynn Monday. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway first insisted that Flynn enjoyed \"the full confidence of the president,\" but less than an hour later, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, announced Trump was \"evaluating the situation.\"  But a bombshell news report on Monday night by the Washington Post appeared to finally set Flynn's resignation in motion. The Post reported that then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House in late January that she believed \"Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador.\" The paper reported that Yates had \"warned that [Flynn] was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail.\"  In a resignation letter posted by the White House soon after the news broke, Flynn admitted that he had inadvertently provided incomplete information to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his calls to the Russian ambassador.  BREAKING: Mike Flynn has RESIGNED his post as national security adviser, White House sources tell me.  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) February 14, 2017  Flynn's resignation was accepted late Monday by President Trump who named Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. as Acting National Security Adviser.  Here's the full text of Flynn's resignation, courtesy of the White House:  In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States. I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way. I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world. As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency. I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again.

Shortly after 6 p.m., two hours before Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak, university police called off the event.  A statement released by the university said campus police determined the event could no longer take place \"amid violence, destruction of property and out of concern for public safety.\" It went on to defend the university's decision to host the event in the first place, arguing that \"while Yiannopoulos' views, tactics and rhetoric are profoundly contrary to our own, we are bound by the Constitution, the law, our values and the campuss Principles of Community to enable free expression across the full spectrum of opinion and perspective.\"  \"We came here tonight to help make sure this event did not happen,\" said Nick Pardee, 26, protesting with a group from the Party for Socialism and Liberation. \"We came here to prevent the hate speech that leads to acts like the shooting in the Quebec mosque the other night.\"  One man who wanted to be referred to as \"Red\" said, \"You have to confront fascism and not let it advance or give it a platform. You can't even allow the platform to spew their bullshit.\"  \"This should be standard practice,\" he added.  Police giving protestors ten minutes to disperse.

TRUMPS ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS  Remarks as prepared for delivery TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.  Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice - in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.  That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.  A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.  A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.  And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.  What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.  Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.  All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.  In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.  It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.  But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?  I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.  For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.  We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land.  We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.  And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.  Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds - families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.  But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.  Finally, the chorus became an earthquake  and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.  Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.  Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.  Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.  And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.  Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.  It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.  Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.  The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.  We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials - and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.  We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce jobcrushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.  We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.  We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.  To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.  I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.  We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.  At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed - but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.  For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.  As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.  To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?  Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.  According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home - from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.  We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.  It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.  We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.  That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.  As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.  I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.  Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.  Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.  Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.  Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.  More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.  We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.  In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.  We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.  And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.  Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.  But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.  Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.  My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.  We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.  Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.  I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.  At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.  They weren't even asking for change. But I am.  I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.  The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\"  Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.  I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.  Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others - have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.  Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families - including immigrant families - enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nations security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.  Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program - the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.  America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country - twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.  To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs.  This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.  Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.  Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.  Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.  One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges - leaving many Americans with no choice at all.  Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?  We now know that all of those promises have been broken.  Obamacare is collapsing - and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice - it is a necessity.  So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.  Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:  First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.  Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts - but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.  Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.  Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance  and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.  Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines - creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.  Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.  Our citizens deserve this, and so much more - so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.  My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.  True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.  An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.  Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.  On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.  Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.  But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.  If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.  In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.  But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind - and the souls - of every American child.  Education is the civil rights issue of our time.  I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.  Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.  We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.  But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.  The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.  In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone - and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.  This is not acceptable in our society.  Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.  But to create this future, we must work with - not against - the men and women of law enforcement.  We must build bridges of cooperation and trust - not drive the wedge of disunity and division.  Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters  and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.  We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  And we must support the victims of crime.  I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE - Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.  Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.  Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.  Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.  Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands - Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis - were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.  Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.  To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know - we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.  Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and - if they must - to fight and to win.  I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.  My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.  Our veterans have delivered for this Nation - and now we must deliver for them.  The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.  And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.  We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero - battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.  I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom - we will never forget him.  To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.  Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.  We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.  But our partners must meet their financial obligations.  And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.  We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific - to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.  We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people - and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.  We must learn from the mistakes of the past - we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.  The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.  America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.  We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.  Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.  On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.  Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.  Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.  Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.  Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.  Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.  Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.  American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.  Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.  And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.  When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.  This is our vision. This is our mission.  But we can only get there together.  We are one people, with one destiny.  We all bleed the same blood.  We all salute the same flag.  And we are all made by the same God.  And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.  The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.  We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.  The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.  And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.  From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears -  inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past -  and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.  I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --  Believe in yourselves.  Believe in your future.  And believe, once more, in America.  Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/read-full-text-donald-trumps-speech-congress", "title": "Here Are 4,826 Words Donald Trump Included in His Speech"}, {"text": "The Department of Homeland Security on Friday denied reports that the Trump administration is considering using as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to detain undocumented immigrants living in the United States. \"It's incorrect,\" department spokesman David Lapan said in an email. \"The Department is not considering mobilizing the National Guard for immigration enforcement.\"  On Friday morning, the Associated Press reported that it had obtained a draft memo outlining the proposal:  The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.

Nonetheless, once the story was released, the White House immediately insisted it had no plans to mobilize the National Guard to round up immigrants.  \"That is 100 percent not true,\" said press secretary Sean Spicer, according to a pool report. \"It is false.

According to the New York Times:  The decision by Mr. Obama rescued Ms. Manning, who twice tried to commit suicide last year, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman incarcerated at the male military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. She has been jailed for nearly seven years, and her 35-year sentence was by far the longest punishment ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction. Now, under the terms of Mr. Obamas commutation announced by the White House on Tuesday, Ms. Manning is set to be freed in five months, on May 17 of this year, rather than in 2045.  The news comes amid other high-profile commutations granted by the president as he prepares to leave office on Friday. One notable absence from the list of pardons on Tuesday, however, was Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who fled to Russia after disclosing classified information. When asked about the clemency applications of both Manning and Snowden last week, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest argued there was a \"stark difference\" between the two cases.  Journalist Katie Couric was on the phone with Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing Manning, as news of the commutation broke:  Was just on the phone at the very moment @chasestrangio, Chelsea Manning's attorney, heard the news and exclaimed...1/3  Katie Couric (@katiecouric) January 17, 2017 2/3 \"Oh my god, she will be freed on May 17th.\" @chasestrangio also said_  Katie Couric (@katiecouric) January 17, 2017 3/3 _If you had told me a month ago President Obama was even considering this, I wouldn't have believed it.\"  Katie Couric (@katiecouric) January 17, 2017  \"I'm relieved and thankful that the president is doing the right thing and commuting Chelsea Manning's sentence,\" Strangio said in a statement released by the ACLU. \"Since she was first taken into custody, Chelsea has been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinementincluding for attempting suicideand has been denied access to medically necessary health care. This move could quite literally save Chelseas life, and we are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many.\"  Some conservatives, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), however, were quick to condemn Obama's decision to grant Manning a commutation. \"We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr,\" Cotton said.

My fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well-wishes weve received over the past few weeks. But tonight its my turn to say thanks. Whether weve seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people  in living rooms and schools; at farms and on factory floors; at diners and on distant outposts  are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.  I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life. It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss. This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it.  After eight years as your President, I still believe that. And its not just my belief. Its the beating heart of our American idea  our bold experiment in self-government.  Its the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Its the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that We, the People, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union.  This is the great gift our Founders gave us. The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, toil, and imagination  and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a greater good.  For 240 years, our nations call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation. Its what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom. Its what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande, pushed women to reach for the ballot, powered workers to organize. Its why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan  and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.  So thats what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.  Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard, contentious and sometimes bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.  If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history_if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Irans nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11_if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens  you might have said our sights were set a little too high.  But thats what we did. Thats what you did. You were the change. You answered peoples hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.  In ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next. I committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me. Because its up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.  We have what we need to do so. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth. Our youth and drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention mean that the future should be ours.  But that potential will be realized only if our democracy works. Only if our politics reflects the decency of the our people. Only if all of us, regardless of our party affiliation or particular interest, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.  Thats what I want to focus on tonight  the state of our democracy.  Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders quarreled and compromised, and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity  the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.  There have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism  these forces havent just tested our security and prosperity, but our democracy as well. And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland.  In other words, it will determine our future.  Our democracy wont work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity. Today, the economy is growing again; wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are rising again; poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a ten-year low. The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower. Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. And if anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements weve made to our health care system  that covers as many people at less cost  I will publicly support it.  That, after all, is why we serve  to make peoples lives better, not worse.  But for all the real progress weve made, we know its not enough. Our economy doesnt work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class. But stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic principles. While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and rural counties, have been left behind  the laid-off factory worker; the waitress and health care worker who struggle to pay the bills  convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their government only serves the interests of the powerful  a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.  There are no quick fixes to this long-term trend. I agree that our trade should be fair and not just free. But the next wave of economic dislocation wont come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.  And so we must forge a new social compact  to guarantee all our kids the education they need; to give workers the power to unionize for better wages; to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from the new economy dont avoid their obligations to the country thats made their success possible. We can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we cant be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we dont create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.  Theres a second threat to our democracy  one as old as our nation itself. After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. Ive lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago  you can see it not just in statistics, but in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.  But were not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they dont look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children  because those brown kids will represent a larger share of Americas workforce. And our economy doesnt have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.  Going forward, we must uphold laws against discrimination  in hiring, in housing, in education and the criminal justice system. Thats what our Constitution and highest ideals require. But laws alone wont be enough. Hearts must change. If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation, each one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view_until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.  For blacks and other minorities, it means tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face  the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender American, and also the middle-aged white man who from the outside may seem like hes got all the advantages, but whos seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change.  For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didnt suddenly vanish in the 60s; that when minority groups voice discontent, theyre not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; that when they wage peaceful protest, theyre not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our Founders promised.  For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, Italians, and Poles. America wasnt weakened by the presence of these newcomers; they embraced this nations creed, and it was strengthened.  So regardless of the station we occupy; we have to try harder; to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.  None of this is easy. For too many of us, its become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or college campuses or places of worship or our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. The rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste  all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence thats out there.  This trend represents a third threat to our democracy. Politics is a battle of ideas; in the course of a healthy debate, well prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, well keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible.  Isnt that part of what makes politics so dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when were cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? Its not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; its self-defeating. Because as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.  Take the challenge of climate change. In just eight years, weve halved our dependence on foreign oil, doubled our renewable energy, and led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children wont have time to debate the existence of climate change; theyll be busy dealing with its effects: environmental disasters, economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.  Now, we can and should argue about the best approach to the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.  Its that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse  the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral; the spirit that that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.  Its that spirit  a faith in reason, and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression, and build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but on principles  the rule of law, human rights, freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and an independent press.  That order is now being challenged  first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam; more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets, open democracies, and civil society itself as a threat to their power. The peril each poses to our democracy is more far-reaching than a car bomb or a missile. It represents the fear of change; the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable; an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of whats true and whats right.  Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, and the intelligence officers, law enforcement, and diplomats who support them, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years; and although Boston and Orlando remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. Weve taken out tens of thousands of terrorists  including Osama bin Laden. The global coalition were leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders, and taken away about half their territory. ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe. To all who serve, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander-in-Chief.  But protecting our way of life requires more than our military. Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear. So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. Thats why, for the past eight years, Ive worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. Thats why weve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. Thats why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans. Thats why we cannot withdraw from global fights  to expand democracy, and human rights, womens rights, and LGBT rights  no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression. If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.  So lets be vigilant, but not afraid. ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world  unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.  Which brings me to my final point  our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions. When voting rates are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should make it easier, not harder, to vote. When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service. When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.  And all of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power swings.  Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But its really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power  with our participation, and the choices we make. Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms. Whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.  In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken_to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; that we should preserve it with jealous anxiety; that we should reject the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties that make us one.  We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character are turned off from public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are not just misguided, but somehow malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.  It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task weve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: Citizen.  Ultimately, thats what our democracy demands. It needs you. Not just when theres an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If youre tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talk with one in real life. If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If youre disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere. Sometimes youll win. Sometimes youll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in others can be a risk, and there will be times when the process disappoints you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America  and in Americans  will be confirmed.  Mine sure has been. Over the course of these eight years, Ive seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. Ive mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in Charleston church. Ive seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch, and our wounded warriors walk again. Ive seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. Ive seen the youngest of children remind us of our obligations to care for refugees, to work in peace, and above all to look out for each other.  That faith I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change  that faith has been rewarded in ways I couldnt possibly have imagined. I hope yours has, too. Some of you here tonight or watching at home were there with us in 2004, in 2008, in 2012  and maybe you still cant believe we pulled this whole thing off.  Youre not the only ones. Michelle  for the past twenty-five years, youve been not only my wife and mother of my children, but my best friend. You took on a role you didnt ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. Youve made me proud. Youve made the country proud.  Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that Ive done in my life, Im most proud to be your dad.  To Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delawares favorite son: you were the first choice I made as a nominee, and the best. Not just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother. We love you and Jill like family, and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our life.  To my remarkable staff: For eight years  and for some of you, a whole lot more  Ive drawn from your energy, and tried to reflect back what you displayed every day: heart, and character, and idealism. Ive watched you grow up, get married, have kids, and start incredible new journeys of your own. Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you. The only thing that makes me prouder than all the good weve done is the thought of all the remarkable things youll achieve from here.  And to all of you out there  every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town and kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change  you are the best supporters and organizers anyone could hope for, and I will forever be grateful. Because yes, you changed the world.  Thats why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than I was when we started. Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans; it has inspired so many Americans  especially so many young people out there  to believe you can make a difference; to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. This generation coming up  unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic  Ive seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, just, inclusive America; you know that constant change has been Americas hallmark, something not to fear but to embrace, and you are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. Youll soon outnumber any of us, and I believe as a result that the future is in good hands.  My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I wont stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain. For now, whether youre young or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President  the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago.  I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change  but in yours.  I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written:  Yes We Can.  Yes We Did.  Yes We Can.  Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.", "date": "2017/01/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/president-obama-farewell-speech-watch", "title": "President Obama Just Delivered His Farewell Address to the Nation. There Wasn't a Dry Eye in the Room."}, {"text": "This story originally appeared on ProPublica.  In 2015, OneWest Bank moved to foreclose on John Yang, an 80-year-old Korean immigrant living in Orange Park, Florida, a small suburb of Jacksonville. The bank believed he wasn't living in his home, violating the terms of its loan. It dispatched an agent to give him legal notification of the foreclosure.  Where did the bank find him? At the same single-story home the bank had said in court papers he did not occupy.  Still OneWest pressed on, forcing Yang, a former Christian missionary, to seek help from legal aid attorneys. This year, during a deposition, an employee of OneWest's servicing division was asked the obvious question: Why would the bank pursue a foreclosure that seemed so clearly unjustified by the facts?  In recent years, OneWest has foreclosed on at least 50,000 people, often in circumstances that consumer advocates say run counter to federal rules and common sense.  The employee's response was blunt: \"You're trying to make logic out of an illogical situation.\"  Yang was lucky. The bank eventually dropped its efforts against him. But others were not so fortunate. In recent years, OneWest has foreclosed on at least 50,000 people, often in circumstances that consumer advocates say run counter to federal rules and, as in Yang's case, common sense.  President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary has prompted new scrutiny of OneWest's foreclosure practices. Mnuchin was the lead investor and chairman of the company during the years it ramped up its foreclosure efforts. Representatives from the company and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.  Records show the attempt to push Mr. Yang out of his home was not an unusual one for OneWest's Financial Freedom unit, which focused on controversial home loans known as reverse mortgages. Regulators and consumer advocates have long worried that these loans, popular during the height of the housing bubble, exploit elderly homeowners.  The loans allow people to benefit from the equity they have built up over many years without selling their houses. The money is paid in a variety of ways, from lump sums to a stream of monthly checks. Borrowers are allowed to stay in their homes for as long as they live.  The loans are guaranteed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, meaning the agency pays lenders like Freedom Financial the difference between the ultimate sale price of the home and the size of the reverse mortgage.  But the fees are often high and the interest charges mount up quickly because the homeowner isn't paying down any of the principal on the loan. Homeowners remain on the hook for property taxes and insurance and can lose their homes if they miss those payments.  A 2012 report to Congress by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said \"vigorous enforcement is necessary to ensure that older homeowners are not defrauded of a lifetime of home equity.\"  ProPublica found numerous examples where Financial Freedom had foreclosed for legally questionable reasons. The company served several other homeowners at their homes to let them know they were being sued for not occupying their homes. In Florida, a shortfall of only $0.27 led to a foreclosure attempt. In Atlanta, the company sought to foreclose on a widow after her husband's death but backed down when a legal aid attorney sued, citing federal law that allowed the surviving spouse to remain in the home.  \"It appears their business approach is scorched earth, in a way that doesn't serve communities, homeowners or the taxpayer,\" said Alys Cohen, a staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center in Washington, DC.  Since the financial crisis, OneWest, through Financial Freedom, has conducted a disproportionate number of the nation's reverse mortgage foreclosures. It was responsible for 16,200 foreclosures on government-backed reverse mortgages, or 39 percent of all foreclosures nationwide, from 2009 through late 2014, even though it only serviced about 17 percent of the loans, according to government data analyzed by the California Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group for low-income consumers. While some foreclosures were justified, legal aid attorneys say Financial Freedom has refused to work with borrowers in foreclosure to establish payment plans, in contrast with other servicers of reverse mortgages.  About three-quarters of homeowners who sought a modification from OneWest through the program were denied, according to the latest figures from the Treasury Department.  Experts say the companies are not entirely to blame for the wave of foreclosures. HUD oversees standards on most reverse mortgages. In the years after the housing crash, HUD's rules evolved, creating a miasma of confusion for mortgage servicers. Companies say the new federal rules required them to foreclose when borrowers fell far behind on property and insurance costs, rather than work out payment plans.  OneWest's rough treatment of homeowners extended to its behavior toward borrowers with standard mortgages in the aftermath of the housing crash. In 2009, the Obama administration launched a program to encourage mortgage servicers to work out affordable mortgage modifications with borrowers. OneWest, weighed down by several hundred thousand souring mortgages, signed up.  It didn't go well. About three-quarters of homeowners who sought a modification from OneWest through the program were denied, according to the latest figures from the Treasury Department. OneWest was among the worst-performing large servicers in the program by that measure. In 2011, activists protested OneWest's indifference at Mnuchin's Bel Air mansion in Los Angeles.  \"We're in a difficult economic environment and very sympathetic to the problems many homeowners face, but under the government's program there's not a solution in every case,\" Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal that year.  Despite the controversy, Mnuchin and the other investors in OneWest made a killing on their purchase. In 2009, Mnuchin's investment group bought the failed mortgage bank IndyMac, which had been taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the financial crisis, changing the name to OneWest. They paid about $1.5 billion, with the FDIC sharing the ongoing mortgage losses. George Soros, a Clinton backer at whose hedge fund Mnuchin had worked, and John Paulson, a hedge fund manager who also supported Trump, invested alongside Mnuchin in IndyMac.  In 2015, CIT, a lender to small- and medium-sized businesses, bought OneWest for $3.4 billion, more than doubling the Mnuchin group's initial investment. Mnuchin personally made about $380 million on the sale, according to Bloomberg estimates. He retains around a 1 percent stake in CIT, worth about $100 million, which he may have to divest if confirmed.  CIT has found the reverse mortgage business to be a headache. Recently, CIT took a $230 million pretax charge after it discovered that OneWest had mistakenly charged the government for payments that the company should have shouldered itself. An investigation of Financial Freedom's practices by HUD's inspector general is ongoing.  Yang's lawyers at Jacksonville Area Legal Aid fought his foreclosure for a year. Though Yang had run a dry-cleaning business in Florida and roamed the world as a missionary, working in North Korea, China, and Afghanistan, the bank's torrent of paperwork had overwhelmed him. Yang didn't speak English well. OneWest claimed it had sent him forms to verify he was living at his home, but that he never sent them back.  Under HUD rules, OneWest was required to verify that each borrower continued to use the property as a principal residence. It is a condition of all the HUD-backed loans in order to help ensure the government subsidy goes to those who need it.  But Yang can be forgiven for thinking OneWest could not have doubted that he was still in his home. During the same period that OneWest was moving to foreclose on Yang for not living in his home, another arm of the bank regularly spoke and corresponded with him at his home about a delinquent insurance payment, according to court documents.  A Financial Freedom employee testified in the case that the department that handled delinquent insurance payments and the department that handled occupancy did not communicate with each other in those circumstances.", "date": "2017/01/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/trump-treasury-pick-foreclosure-practices-homeowners%20", "title": "Trump's Treasury Pick Excelled at Kicking Elderly People Out of Their Homes"}, {"text": "For nearly eight years, the Obama administration regularly released the names of visitors to the White House and the adjoining executive branch office buildings, along with the dates of their visits and the names of the officials who hosted them. The visitor logs provided a rare glimpse of the comings and goings of the most powerful office in the world.  Will President Donald Trump continue the practice of releasing the visitor logs? The administration won't say. Mother Jones recently put the question to the Trump White House on several different occasions. The answer: silence.  The Obama administration was the first to voluntarily release data on White House visitors. The practice by President Barack Obama had its flaws: Administration officials typically waited 90 to 120 days to release the logs, and they had wide latitude to withhold certain names from the visitor logs that they deemed politically or personally sensitive, including friends of the first family and potential nominees undergoing vetting. What's more, there was no transparency into how Obama officials came to decide which names to withhold and which to include.  Nonetheless, the logs gave the public a useful view into how the White House conducted business and with whom it was conducting that business. \"Americans may not realize how many people are in and out of the White House complex every day,\" says John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, which supports greater transparency in government. \"There are a lot of meetings in the West Wing or in the connected official buildings as part of the White House complex where people are setting the agenda and working with and lobbying the administration. The visitor logs, even though they're flawed, provided a meaningful window into understanding what was happening at the White House.\"  Transparency about who visits the White House could be especially important for the Trump administration, which has taken a dim view of federal ethics laws and compliance. Trump has refused to divest from his global business holdings. His administration skipped the ethics portion of a training course for senior staff. And Trump's freewheeling interactions with dues-paying guests at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in south Florida, have raised questions about access-peddling. (This weekend, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly greeted guests at Mar-a-Lago.)  Since Trump's election, his transition team and then his administration have remained mum on the fate of the visitor logs initiative. The website where the Obama administration published the logs is blank except for a brief message: \"This page is being updated. It will post records of White House visitors on an ongoing basis, once they become available.\" And the data released by the Obama White House to power the online visitors log is no longer searchable but can be found via the National Archives.  Under Obama, media outlets made ample use of the White House visitor logs. We drew on them often here at Mother Jones. So did the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. So, too, did one of Trump's favorite outlets, Breitbart News, which published numerous stories referencing the logs.  Eight Democratic senators on Monday sent letters to Trump and the Secret Service questioning whether the new administration would continue the practice of releasing visitor logs. They also urged Trump and the Secret Service to extend the visitor logs disclosure to include Mar-a-Lago, where Trump has spent considerable time as president and which he calls his \"winter White House.\"  \"We see no reason why you would be unable to continue policies of your predecessor,\" the letter reads. \"And we urge you to extend those policies to address your decision to regularly conduct official business at private properties that also provide access to certain members of the public.\" Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) signed the letter.

New York City property records show that Xiao Yan Chen, the founder and managing director of a business consulting firm called Global Alliance Associates, purchased the four-bedroom, six-bathroom condo in Trump's Park Avenue high-rise on February 21. Before taking office, Trump signed documents removing himself from the board of directors of Trump Park Avenue LLC, the entity that sold the unit, but he remains the LLC's owner.  Chen, who also goes by Angela Chen, did not return multiple calls and emails requesting comment. Her company bills itself as a \"boutique business relationship consultancy\" for US firms seeking to do business in China. \"For a select clientele,\" the firm says that it \"facilitates the right strategic relationships with the most prominent public and private decision makers in China.\"  \"As counselors in consummating the right relationshipsquite simplywe provide access,\" the company's website claims. \"Establishing a network of credible and proprietary relationships, known by the Chinese as 'ghanxi,' is the single most important aspect of initiating and sustaining a successful business venture in China.\" A connection with Trumpeven a fleeting onecould only help in the ghanxi department.  According to Chen's bio on the Global Alliance website, she previously worked for Prudential Insurance, helping the company establish a private banking group in China, where she \"developed and managed the Group's high net worth private client base.\" Before that, Chen's biography says she worked at Merrill Lynch, where she ran the China Futures Trading Desk and counted as clients numerous state-owned companies, such as Sinochem, Ocean Shipping Group, and China National Nonferrous Metals.  Until Chen's purchase, none of Trump's major real estate properties had reported any major sales since he became president. The condo was never publicly listed for sale, although Chen lists her current address as a smaller apartment in the Trump Park Avenue building. (It's unclear whether she owns that unit, which was last purchased in 2004 by an entity called Lancer Trust.)  According to Zillow.com, the penthouse unit Chen purchased last week has an estimated value of $14.3 million. Other penthouse units in the building have sold for comparable sums. One fetched $21 million.  The sale agreement for Chen's penthouse was signed by Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, whom Trump tapped to serve along with his sons on the three-person panel that will run his company while he serves as president.

On Friday evening, the FEC's three Republican members quietly released a slew of missing legal memos related to cases dating back as far as 10 years. The commissioners gave no reason for why they decided to act now, after a decade of silence on the cases in question.  But it turns out that the newly released memos were the result of a Freedom of Information Act request recently filed by Mother Jones. The request was a modest one and asked only for a list of all such overdue legal documents at the FEC. That list would show every case for which FEC commissioners had failed to perform a customary part of their jobs: explaining to the public why they had voted a certain way on cases that had come before the agency. Dismiss a complaint, open an investigation, assess a finewhichever way a commissioner decides, he or she is expected to explain that decision in a memo made available to the public.  In a move that perplexed several legal experts, the FEC denied our FOIA request. Yet soon after that, the FEC's three Republican commissioners hastily wrote and released to the public 11 of these long-overdue legal memos. When Mother Jones asked the three Republican commissioners if our FOIA request had anything to do with their decision to act, two of them, Lee Goodman and Matthew Petersen, confirmed that it had. \"Most of these were on the back burner as our reasons were either already clear or changes in the law made the issues moot,\" Petersen says. \"Your request was a useful reminder to bolster the record with formal statements.\"  Congress created the FEC in the 1970s to police campaign-related abuses and enforce election laws passed in the wake of Watergate. Unlike most federal agencies, the FEC has an even number of commissionerssixdivided equally by political party. In today's hyper-partisan environment, with frequent 3-3 deadlocks on key votes, it's hard not to see the FEC as an institution designed to fail. (The commission will be without a sixth member now that Democrat Ann Ravel has announced her resignation, effective March 1.)  But for most of its 40-year history, the FEC worked mostly fine. The commissioners regularly found the four-vote majority they needed to actto investigate potential wrongdoing, assess fines against lawbreakers, and provide guidance to candidates, committees, political parties, and other outfits looking to get involved in federal elections. That began to change in the mid-2000s. Three new Republicans came aboard who took a more ideological approach to campaign finance laws and free speech. Led by then-Commissioner Donald McGahn, who is now President Donald Trump's White House counsel, the Republicans often voted in lockstep to block enforcement actions. A Public Citizen analysis found that the FEC hit a 3-3 vote on enforcement actions roughly 1 percent of the time between 2003 and 2007. In 2008, deadlocks rose to 10 percent. In 2013, they hit a peak of 23 percent. \"For nearly every case of major significance over the past several years, the Commission has deadlocked on investigating serious allegations or has failed to hold violators fully accountable,\" outgoing Democratic Commissioner Ann Ravel wrote in a recent report titled Dysfunction and Deadlock.  When FEC commissioners vote on a case to go against what the agency's lawyers recommend, they are required to publish a legal justificationa Statement of Reasons, in agency jargonfor why they voted the way they did. These memos educate the public on the legal underpinnings of the commission's decisions and give outside parties a basis to sue the agency if they disagree. But starting in the mid-2000s, the FEC's Republicans simply stopped explaining many of their decisions. Some or all of the Republican commissioners failed to write Statements of Reasons in 25 such cases over a 10-year span, according to an unofficial tally obtained by Mother Jones earlier this month. (The tally shows that Democratic commissioners had no overdue Statements of Reasons.)  Larry Noble, a former FEC general counsel who now works at the Campaign Legal Center, a group that supports tighter political donation limits and more transparency in elections, says that failure to file Statements of Reasons is longstanding problem that has worsened over time. \"Delaying them deprives the public of knowing what's going on or why commissioners did what they did,\" Noble says.  A few weeks ago, Mother Jones filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the FEC's own list of all overdue legal Statements of Reasons. In its February 17 denial letter, an FEC official cited FOIA Exemption 5, which shields from disclosure \"documents covered by the attorney work-product, deliberative process, and attorney-client privileges.\"  Two hours after the denial, the FEC posted its weekly digest. It included the 11 Statements of Reasons authored by Republican commissioners relating to old cases. The documents were all signed and dated within a four-day span last week, and each one is only several pages long, unlike the lengthy, footnote-laden documents typically produced by the commissioners and their staffs.  Ellen Weintraub, the senior-most Democratic commissioner at FEC, applauded the release of the 11 legal memos. \"I am pleased on behalf of the American people that they are finally getting some kind of explanation for the commission's failure to act in so many cases,\" she says.", "date": "2017/02/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/federal-election-commission-republicans-mother-jones", "title": "Republican Election Commissioners Just Released Key Legal Documents\u0089\u00db\u00d3Nearly a Decade Too Late"}, {"text": "On a recent Tuesday evening, a donor, lobbyist, or foreign diplomat hoping to make inroads with President Donald Trump and his retinue of family members and allies needed only to show up to the lobby bar of the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Seated together on couches near the bar were Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest son and now the co-head of the Trump Organization; Brad Parscale, the digital guru for Trump's presidential campaign who is now running an outside group created to bolster Trump and his agenda; and Nick Ayers, a political consultant and former aide to Vice President Mike Pence who is also working for Trump's new outside group. With security guards stationed nearby, the men held court, posed for photos with guests, and then headed to the White House to attend the announcement ceremony for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.  No president in American history has entered office as conflict-ridden as Trump. It's almost impossible to keep track of all the ways someone seeking to influence him and his administration could do so without a trace. A donation made through a shell corporation to Trump's inaugural committee. An undisclosed donation to America First Policies, the new outside group run by Ayers, Parscale, and other ex-Trump aides. A monthly retainer to Avenue Strategies, the consulting firm launched by former Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Barry Bennett and conveniently located one block from the White House.  But there is a simpler and more direct way to put money in the pocket of the new president and his family: spend money at a Trump hotel or resort. Lots of money. In many ways, the president's propertieswhich he refuses to divest or separate himself from in any serious wayserve as ideal conduits for directly influencing and even bribing the Trump administration.  Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University and an expert on federal contracting, says an individual, corporation, or foreign government could pay for rooms at Trump hotels, spend lavishly at hotel restaurants, and drop sizeable sums on ballrooms and other event spaces to direct money to the Trump family in the hopes of acquiring influence. \"It's a win-win,\" Schooner says. \"If you use the space, you're entertaining people on the president's property, and if you don't, you've basically just funneled the money to the president and the president's family.\"  At this point, Schooner added, there is no way for anyone outside the Trump Organization and the Trump family to know if any corporations, lobbyists, advocacy groups, businesspeople, foreign governments, or overseas leaders spend money at Trump properties. (Ditto arms traders, sleazy financiers, or any other bad actors.) Noting the recent decision by Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to double its initiation fee, Schooner said, \"They're willing to raise the price on anything. What would be an outrageous payment for a social event at a Trump property? $100,000? $200,000? $300,000? And the public will never find [out] about it.\" In other words, anyone who wanted the Trumps' attention and goodwill could rent out space at a Trump hotel or resort for an exorbitant amountwhether they actually used it for a function or not.  Foreign dignitaries have already flocked to Trump's Washington hotel. A week after the election, nearly 100 foreign diplomats partied at one of the hotel's ballroom spaces, dubbed the Lincoln Library. Kuwait moved its annual National Day party from the Four Seasons to Trump's DC hotel. As one Asian diplomat told the Washington Post in November, \"Why wouldn't I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, 'I love your new hotel!'? Isn't it rude to come to his city and say, 'I am staying at your competitor?'\"  A DC-based lobbyist, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about Trump and his properties, told me that he hadn't personally felt pressure to patronize Trump's hotel, but \"reading between the lines isn't that tough here.\" He went on, \"There is a reason that the senior staff hang out in the lobby bar at the hotel. They are seeing who spends time and money there and who books large parties there and large blocks of rooms for delegations.\" The lobbyist said he wouldn't be surprised to see major trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce or the National Association of Broadcasters use the hotel to put up visiting colleagues and affiliates. \"Point is,\" the lobbyist said, \"someone is paying attention to the person who orders the $1,000 bottle of wine.\"  Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) recently sent a letter to Trump requesting information from Mar-a-Lago, the Trump-owned private club in South Florida that will serve as the president's winter White House. Whitehouse and Udall asked Trump to make public Mar-a-Lago's private membership list and the names of members and visitors to the club when Trump is there, and to explain how Trump plans to screen members and guests for ties to foreign governments that may seek to influence the president. \"Now that you are president, you have an obligation to dispel any suspicions that access to you can be purchased by a private club membership fee,\" the senators wrote. (The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment for this story.)  Unlike presidents before him, Trump has refused to divest from his international business holdings, over the objections of myriad ethics experts. Indeed, the Trump Organization is capitalizing on the soaring profile of its founder. Mar-a-Lago upped its initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000. A Trump Organization executive also suggested that the company plans to expand its hotel offerings, eyeing 26 US metropolitan areas for new projects. (The company currently has properties in five major markets.) At Trump's January 11 press conference, a lawyer for Trump said the new president would step down from management roles at the Trump Organization and put his assets into a trust controlled by his sons but would not give up his ownership stake. Trump's lawyer also said Trump would donate the profitsnot revenuefrom his hotels derived from foreign government sources to the US Treasury, but at present there is no method for confirming that Trump is in fact complying with the agreement.  Outside ethics experts say Trump's conflicts-of-interest plan does almost nothing to clear up problems that could arise during his presidency. Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan \"meaningless.\" Norm Eisen, who served as an ethics attorney under President Obama, told Mother Jones that Trump's plan \"falls short in every respect.\"  Trump still stands to benefit financially from the properties he owns. He recently transferred ownership stake in his Washington hotel into a trust that exists solely \"to hold assets for the exclusive benefit of Donald J. Trump,\" according to a regulatory filing obtained by ProPublica. So money spent at the Trump International Hotel in Washington still winds up in his own coffers. It doesn't have to create a profit for Trump to benefit: Hotel revenue can cover overhead and debt payments, such as Trump's $170 million loan from Deutsche Bank for his DC hotel.  Trump said at his January 11 press conference that he would not discuss business with his sons, but ethics experts say there is no way to police this. Donald Jr. and Eric appear to enjoy ample access to their father, to the White House, and to policymakers in and around the administration. On inauguration weekend, the brothers hobnobbed with their father's foreign business partners at inaugural parties. The brothers' social-media accounts show them sitting front row for Gorsuch's announcement ceremony in the West Wing and later chatting one-on-one with Gorsuch while Pence stood awkwardly behind Donald Jr.  So how much could someone trying to gain goodwill with Trump potentially spend at one of his hotels? Going by the hotel's advertised rate of $481 a night, a 20-room reservation for 10 dayswhether used or notadds up to $96,400. The hotel's suites range in price from $1,025 a night (the Ivanka suite) to $25,000 a night (the Trump Townhouse).  The Trump administration has gone out of its way to promote Trump's Washington hotel. Sean Spicer, then the incoming White House press secretary, plugged the hotel during a press briefing on the day before Trump's swearing-in. \"It's an absolutely stunning hotel,\" Spicer told reporters. \"I encourage you to go there if you haven't been by.\" During the official inaugural parade, Trump stopped his motorcade near the hotel, exited his vehicle, and began walking along Pennsylvania Avenue, where he and his family waved to fans. Since Trump took office, his Washington hotel has become a hub and gathering spot for Trump supporters, acolytes, andyesfamily members.  Larry Noble, the general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a good-government group that has highlighted Trump's many conflicts of interest, says Trump could have easily resolved any conflicts stemming from the Washington hotel and all the other properties he owns or financially benefits from by fully divesting his assets. \"The hotel is a shining example of his conflicts of interest and his arrogance about his conflicts of interest,\" Noble says. \"There's only one answer: He should've divested himself and sold the hotel.\"", "date": "2017/02/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sure-fire-way-funnel-dark-money-donald-trump-book-his-hotels", "title": "Never Has It Been Easier to Get Secret Cash to a President"}, {"text": "Update, 2/6/17, 7:52 a.m.: The number of companies signing on to a joint letter criticizing President Trump's controversial executive order on immigration has doubled in just 72 hours. According to a source involved in drafting the letter, more than 60 companies have now lent their name to the document, with the possibility of more doing so before a 10 a.m. Monday deadline. An updated version of the letter, obtained by Mother Jones, takes issue with the administration's \"blanket or one-size-fits-all\" approach to controlling the flow of immigrants into the U.S. \"We urge you and your administration to find a more tailored alternative to the current Executive Order,\" the letter reads.  More than 30 CEOs at the nation's largest tech companiesincluding Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Uberhave signed onto a letter criticizing President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning all refugees and citizens of seven of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. A source involved in drafting the letter provided the current list of signatories to Mother Jones. The letter, still in draft form, is set to be released and delivered to the White House on Monday, according to the source.  \"We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,\" the letter reads. \"We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country's success.\"  The letter goes on to suggest that Trump's orderwhich has sparked protests around the country and the world and prompted criticism from American and international companiescould make it more difficult for tech firms to recruit talented workers from around the world: \"In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the Executive Order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay.\"  The letter also criticizes the Trump administration's decision to enact an outright travel banpresently at 120 days for refugees, 90 days for citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, and indefinitely for Syrian refugeesas opposed to a more measured restriction. \"While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach,\" the letter reads.  The executives who've signed the letter represent many of the most prominent and powerful companies in the tech industry. Other companies who joined the letter, according to the source, include Twitter, eBay, PayPal, Netflix, and Dropbox. None of the companies mentioned in this story immediately responded to requests for comment.  The technology sector, more than most domestic industries, relies on highly skilled immigrants for its workforce. A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy reported that 51 percent of US-based start-ups that were valued at $1 billion or more had been founded by immigrants. In recent years, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders have sunk millions of dollars into lobbying and political campaigning to convince Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Those efforts have all failed.  And the Trump administration appears more inclined to further restrict immigration and refugee resettlement in the US rather than expand it. The president's top adviser, Stephen Bannon, is a longtime foe of immigration reform and open borders. \"Why even let 'em in?\" Bannon asked on his radio show in November 2015. \"Can't that money be used in the United States? Should we just take a pause and a hiatus for a number of years on any influx from that area of the world?\"  Read the draft letter to be signed by the tech CEOs:", "date": "2017/02/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/facebook-google-apple-ceos-slam-trump-immigration-order", "title": "Execs at Facebook, Google, Apple, and Other Tech Giants Sign Letter Opposing Trump's Immigration Order"}, {"text": "Donald Trump takes office today as the most conflicted and ethically problematic president in the nation's history. He refuses to divest from his global business holdings. His company continues to make foreign deals even after he promised to halt them. He owes hundreds of millions of dollars to domestic and overseas banks and other financial institutions. And Trump has yet to release his tax returns, making it impossible to know the full extent of his business dealings, liabilities, and other potential conflicts in the United States and around the world.  On the first day of Trump's presidency, here is a guide to the conflicts and ethical questions that will dog him from the moment he steps foot in the White House.  Trump's Other Home on Pennsylvania Avenue  There was a joke during the presidential campaign: Win or lose, Trump would still have a presence on DC's iconic Pennsylvania Avenue. The Trump International Hotel opened last year in the historic Old Post Office Building four blocks from the White House, charging $850 a night for a room and $26 for a hamburger. Trump's unexpected victory, however, presented a new problem for the incoming president: He will violate the Trump International's lease the moment he takes office.  Trump's lease with the General Services Administrationthe landlord of the federal governmentbans any elected official, including the president, from having a financial stake in or gaining a financial benefit from the property. Congressional Democrats argue that Trump, under the terms of the lease, must legally divest himself from the 263-room hotel before taking office. If he chooses not to divest, Democrats say the GSA should evict Trump.  The conflicts here are many. Trump's administration will oversee the GSA and handpick its leader, and the agency will in turn be tasked with negotiating with Trump Organization officials over rent, lease terms, and so on. GSA officials have hedged their comments about the fate of the hotel. The agency said in a statement in December that it \"plans to coordinate with the president-elect's team to address any issues that may be related to the Old Post Office building.\" Trump's transition team stayed mum about the lease controversy, while Trump himself has refused to cut ties with the hotel. The Trump International, meanwhile, has courted foreign dignitaries, raising questions about whether the incoming administration was pushing foreign governments to patronize the hotel. This week, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer gave a shout-out to the hotel: \"It's a stunning hotel. I encourage you to go there if you haven't been by.\"  The Foreign Connection  The emoluments clause was an obscure provision of the US Constitutionuntil Trump arrived on the scene. The clause prohibits any government official from receiving money, gifts, or anything else of value from a foreign government. In the view of many constitutional experts, Trump stands in violation of the emoluments clause from the first day of his presidency. \"Applied to Mr. Trump's diverse dealings, the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed,\" wrote Norm Eisen, a former chief ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama, and Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush.  A foreign state-owned bank rents space in a Trump-owned building. Trump has loans via a partnership with the Bank of China. Foreign diplomats and governments are paying to stay at the Trump International Hotel in DC, which is largely owned by Trump and run by his company. And then there are the many Trump-owned and -branded hotels around the globedeals that in some cases involve partnerships with questionable characters. (A project in Azerbaijan with the son of the country's transportation minister is one glaring example.) All of these sources of moneyand many morerun afoul of the emoluments clause, according to Eisen and Painter.  Trump has responded to questions about his conflicts with flat denials. \"The law is totally on my side,\" he said in late November, \"meaning the president can't have a conflict of interest.\" Ethics experts say this isn't true. In an analysis for the Brookings Institution, Eisen and Painter studied legal and historical precedent and came to the conclusion that evidence \"compellingly\" supports \"the longstanding and near-unanimous consensus among lawyers and legal scholars that the Emoluments Clause applies in full to the President.\"  At a press conference earlier this month, Trump said he was turning control of his company over to his sons and declared that the Trump Organization would pursue no new international business during his presidency. He also said the company would terminate many foreign projects (like the Azerbaijani project, which has long been dormant anyway) that the Trump Organization had in development. But just this week, one of his Scottish golf courses announced plans to expand, and Trump projects in Indonesia appear to be moving forward. While Trump bragged at the press conference about turning down a deal with Dubai-based property development company DAMAC, he did not address the fact that he has an ongoing licensing deal with the company worth between $2 million and $10 million a year.  It's Not What You OwnIt's What You Owe  Trump, as Mother Jones has reported, will enter the White House as the most indebted president in history. And the new president's lenders, which include foreign financial institutions, raise a whole slew of questions.  According to Trump's financial disclosure forms, his largest lender is Deutsche Bank, which he owes $364 million. The German bank and US law enforcement officials have sparred in recent years, with the bank agreeing to pay a $7.2 billion fine for its role in the 2008 mortgage crisis. The Justice Department has an ongoing investigation into the bank for allegedly helping funnel money out of Russia.  The fact that Trump will enter office with his biggest lender under investigation by his administration is one of the most obvious conflicts his debts pose. But there are other ethical issues: What happens if one of his lenders wants to renegotiate the loan's terms? How can the public be sure that the bank isn't using its leverage to curry favor or that Trump isn't using his position to seek special treatment? Although Trump has said he is separating himself from the daily operations of his company, he has personally guaranteed a number of his loans. Will Trump recuse himself if a decision directly involving one of his lenders lands on his desk?  Trust Isn't Blind  During his press conference earlier this month, Trump laid out his plan to insulate himself from conflicts of interest. He would place all his assets into a trust controlled by his sons, who would not discuss any of the Trump Organization's business dealings with him. An \"independent ethics adviser\" would vet any new Trump Organization deals. And Trump would donate any hotel profits derived from foreign governments to the US Treasury.  Ethics experts were aghast. They had been nearly unanimous in their advice that Trump place his assets in a blind trust run by an independent trustee who oversees the assets and can sell off those that pose a conflict. Trump's plan was so far outside the boundaries of what past presidents and Cabinet members have typically done that the usually press-shy director of the Office of Government Ethics publicly blasted the proposal. Trump's transition team did not even consult with the OGE, according to Walter Shaub, the office's director. \"We would have told them that this arrangement fails to meet the statutory requirements,\" he said.  For Trump, however, the issue appears to be settledeven if that means entering the White House as the most conflict-ridden president in US history.", "date": "2017/01/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/your-day-one-guide-president-trumps-conflicts-interest", "title": "Your Day-One Guide to President Trump\u0089\u00db\u00aas Conflicts of Interest"}, {"text": "By the time the first day of hearings for Donald Trump's secretary-of-state pick concluded, Rex Tillerson had expressed a range of opinions at odds with those of his future boss. As Sen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) noted, Tillerson's views on Muslims, Russian aggression, Saudi Arabia, NATO, the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, nuclear arms, and more were notably different from Trump's campaign statements.  \"All of these to me are quite encouraging,\" Coons said. \"But these suggest some tensions with the president-elect.\"  Asked about how he'd resolve these differences with Trump's stated views, Tillerson said:  \"One of the reasons I came to the conclusion_to say yes to President-elect Trump when he asked me to do this, is that [in] my conversations with him on the subjects we have discussed_hes been very open and inviting of hearing my views and respectful of those views.

Coons wasn't the only senator to note the contrast with Trump. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) observed, \"Many of these statements have been undercut by earlier statements by the president-elect.\"  Earlier in the day, Shaheen asked Tillerson if he would be willing to divest from Exxon Mobil stock. Tillerson replied that he would.

The informal proposal was revealed Monday by the New York Times.  Not surprisingly, the White House offer was a non-starter. Planned Parenthood executive vice president Dawn Laguens told the Times that the women's health care organization rejected the idea out of hand. \"Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept,\" she said.  Currently, several proposals to defund Planned Parenthood are moving through Congress. One was approved by the House, another was introduced in the Senate, and a third cropped up in a draft of the proposed bill to repeal Obamacare. The measures would make Planned Parenthood and any other clinic that offers abortions \"prohibited entities\" for the use of Medicaid. This means that low-income patients with Medicaid coverage would be barred from using their federally funded benefits at Planned Parenthoodeven to obtain non-abortion health care, such as pap smears, cervical cancer screenings, STI testing, and contraception. It is already illegal for Medicaid to cover most abortions, and it has been for more than 40 years.  In the last Congress, a broader bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed both chambers, but it was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama. Donald Trump, however, said repeatedly on the campaign trail that defunding Planned Parenthood would be a priority for his administration.  Since Inauguration Day, it's become increasingly apparent that even some Republicans are worried about the political repercussions of defunding Planned Parenthood, particularly through the Obamacare repeal. \"We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill,\" said Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.) in leaked audio of a closed-door meeting obtained by the Washington Post in January.

Faced with the prospect of as many as 2.5 million patients losing their health care, more than 150 Planned Parenthood patients and providers gathered on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for more than 200 meetings with lawmakers to describe the impact the organization has had on their lives and health care when facing financial hardship. At a press conference, several former patients spoke about their experiences receiving care while uninsured, underinsured, or otherwise unable to afford it.  \"My two children are the biggest blessing in my life, and I'm thankful every day that I get to be their mother,\" said Courtney Everette of Chicago. \"I know for sure that without Planned Parenthood, I wouldn't have had that privilege.\"  When Everette was a graduate student aging out of her parent's health insurance, she was unable to afford the hormonal birth control that was essential to managing her endometriosis, a chronic condition that affects the uterine lining and can cause infertility. She was able to secure access through her local Planned Parenthood and, years later, learned from her doctors that had she not managed her care as prescribed, she would not have been able to conceive children.  Jamie Benner, a mother from upstate New York, described her local Planned Parenthood's efforts to get testing and Medicaid coverage when she was uninsured and found a lump in her breast. The testing detected her breast cancer in the nick of time, and Jamie is now healthy. \"Had Planned Parenthood waited a day, I would have had stage 4 cancer and I wouldn't be here,\" she said. \"Planned Parenthood made sure I would be here to be there for my girls.\"  Defunding Planned Parenthood has long been a goal of conservatives in Congress, and efforts have intensified in the last two years following a series of secretly recorded, deceptively edited videos showing Planned Parenthood staff discussing the sale of fetal tissue, which would be illegal. (Dozens of state-level investigations found no evidence of such wrongdoing by the women's health care provider.) Seeking to win over pro-life voters while on the campaign trail, Donald Trump targeted the woman's health provider as well, and since his inauguration Republican lawmakers have moved quickly to try to make this goal a reality: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) filed a bill in the Senate, while another measure, sponsored by Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) passed in the House.  Opposition to funding Medicaid for patients who use Planned Parenthood is connected to opposition to abortion, but the Medicaid funds at issue here almost never cover abortions. It has been illegal to use federal funds to cover most abortions for more than 40 years, thanks to the Hyde Amendmentan appropriations rider first passed in 1976 and tacked on to every federal budget since.  Lori Hawkins, a Planned Parenthood patient from House Speaker Paul Ryan's Wisconsin districtwhere in two counties, Racine and Walworth, Planned Parenthood centers are the only options for Medicaid patients seeking family-planning servicescame to DC to lobby her congressman, something she had never done before.

Reproductive Health Services, a case about a Missouri abortion law.  Norma McCorvey, the \"Jane Roe\" plaintiff in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in the United States, died Saturday at at an assisted-living facility in Katy, Texas. She was 69.  McCorvey was a complicated symbol for the political fight over abortion rights. Following the high court's 1973 decision, she became the face of the pro-choice movement. At the time, she represented the struggles faced by ordinary women confronted with unwanted pregnancies. Abortion was illegal in Texas in almost all cases when she learned she was pregnant in 1969. Poor and with a ninth grade education, she didn't have the means to seek abortion across state lines. The legal battle dragged on for three years; by the time she won, she had long since carried the pregnancy to term. She gave the baby up for adoption.  After years as the face of the pro-choice movement, McCorvey reversed her views and became a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion cause.  But in 1995, McCorvey reversed her stance on abortion after discussing the Bible with Pastor Flip Benham, the director of Operation Rescue, an aggressive pro-life group that had moved in next door to the women's health clinic where McCorvey worked. She soon quit her job at the clinic and was baptized by Benham. She became a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion movement, penning a book about her ideological transformation and traveling the country giving speeches to religious groups.  Like McCorvey's own views on abortion, popular opinion about a woman's right to choose has been the subject of much conflict and debate since the landmark 1973 case. And while a strong majority of Americans still agrees with the Roe decision, dismantling the right to an abortion is now an explicit objective for both the new administration and the Republican-led congress.  In the month since President Donald Trump's inauguration, GOP lawmakers have put forward measures aimed at pulling federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood and repealing the Affordable Care Act, including its requirement that insurance plans cover contraceptives. They have also introduced bills that would make abortion illegal after 20 weeks of pregnancy and would ban the standard abortion method used by doctors in the second trimester.  A Supreme Court majority that would be open to overturning Roe is becoming increasingly likely, as well. This is something Trump promised repeatedly during the campaign as part of his largely successful effort to win over skeptical evangelical voters. As a candidate, he made four promises to the anti-abortion community: He pledged to nominate anti-abortion justices; defund Planned Parenthood; sign the 20-week abortion ban; and permanently enshrine into law the Hyde Amendmenta 40-year old budget rider that Congress has repeatedly used to bar federal tax dollars from funding most abortions. Assuming that Judge Neil Gorsuch is confirmed this spring, it may only take the departure of one pro-abortion-rights justice to tip the balance on the court against Roe.  During the campaign, the formerly pro-choice Trump brought on Mike Pence to shore up his anti-abortion bonafides. As governor of Indiana, Pence signed some of the country's strictest abortion restrictions into law, including a measure requiring burial or cremation of aborted fetus remains and a ban on abortions due to fetal anomaly. In a September 2016 speech, Pence told an evangelical conference in Washington, DC, \"I want to live to see the day that we put the sanctity of life back at the center of American law, and we send Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history, where it belongs.\"  Last month, Pence became the highest-ranking government official to ever address the annual March for Life in person. \"Life is winning again in America,\" Pence said at the anti-abortion gathering, pointing to the \"historic election of a president who stands for a stronger America, a more prosperous America, and a president who, I proudly say, stands for the right to life.\"  Roe has been seen by many as an imperfect decision. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the foremost legal warriors for gender equality, has criticized the decision for changing too much, too quickly. After founding the ACLU's women's rights project in the 1970s, Ginsburg focused on fighting sex discrimination with an incremental strategy. She brought several cases to the Supreme Court, building up a body of court victories that together established a sweeping legal and moral understanding of sex discrimination as something that is both illegal and wrong. Roe, she said at a conference in 2014, \"established a target\" for abortion opponents because it ditched this incremental approach, instead imposing a drastic change on states across the country. She suggested that if the high court had moved a little more slowly, today the idea of reproductive choice wouldn't be so controversial. \"A movement against access to abortion for women grew up, flourished, around a single target,\" Ginsburg said.  After her victory as Roe's main plaintiff, McCorvey joined the movement that sprung up to oppose Roe. Her death comes at a time when that movement, with help from the Trump White House, could achieve many of its long-held goals.", "date": "2017/02/18", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/jane-roe-norma-mccorvey-abortion-rights", "title": "\"Jane Roe\" Has Died.

Should it become law, the measure would weaken contraceptive access across the country.  The bill, HJ Resolution 43, allows states to withhold Title X family planning fundsabout $300 million distributed to states annuallyfrom providers who also offer abortion care, a group that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates. In December, Obama's Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that anticipated this sort of effort by prohibiting states from withholding Title X family planning money from Planned Parenthood and other providers. This House resolution proposed overturning that HHS rule via the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal new regulations within 60 days of their passage. A version of this bill is also moving through the Senate.  At a House committee hearing earlier this week, Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) called this bill \"the most serious threat women have faced so far this Congress.\" Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) called this the Republicans' \"first salvo\" in defunding Planned Parenthood.  This development comes on the heels of several actions by the Trump administration and Congress that threaten women's health care. They include Congressional efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring insurance coverage for contraception; the approval by the House of a bill to codify the Hyde Amendment, which prevents the use of federal funds for most abortions; and Trump's expansion of the global gag order, which prohibits health providers overseas from receiving any US funding if they so much as mention abortion as an option for patients.  In the last Congress, a broader bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed both chambers, but was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama.

Like many Democrats, State Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, who is now in her 12th term representing Illinois' 12th district, didn't expect Donald Trump to win the presidency. But on November 9, Feigenholtz, a longtime champion of women's health measures in the General Assembly, realized that Trump's campaign trail talk about appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade could become a reality.  \"We thought we wouldnt have to worry about this stuff,\" Feigenholtz says, \"but the new administration has been a wake-up call. I had to stop and say, 'Okay, now what? How do we protect women?'\"  She was especially concerned about an obscure 40-year-old provision in Illinois' criminal code, one of a number of measures in 10 states across the country, that anticipate a time when the Supreme Court reverses itself on abortion. They are often referred to as \"trigger laws,\" because even though each state's provision works a bit differently, the measures are \"triggered\" by the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Should that occur, these states commit to making abortion illegal in all cases, except to protect a mother's life, just as it was before the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling. (In four states, the trigger law makes the switch back to illegal abortion automatic.)  Feigenholtz was familiar with Illinois' trigger clause from her previous work on women's health measures in the General Assembly. After the election, she contacted local pro-choice advocates, including chapters of the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, to float the idea of proposing a measure to void Illinois' trigger law, as part of a bigger bill that seeks to expand abortion access by including abortion care in Medicaid and state employee health coverage. The bill she introduced in January, HB 40, proposes cutting Illinois' trigger language and affirming the state's commitment to uphold abortion rights, no matter what happens in Washington.  Many such laws, including the one in Illinois, go even further, saying that if Roe is overturned, the state intends to renew their so-called \"policy\" that life begins at conception. This approach could not only affect the legality of abortion but also common forms of birth control, such as Plan B or IUDs, which some anti-abortion advocates consider to be abortifacients despite medical consensus to the contrary.  \"After the passage of Roe, a handful of states said, 'If we can ever go back, we want to go back,'\" says Daniela Kraiem, the associate director of the women and the law program at the Washington College of Law at American University. \"The point of those laws, up until now, has been largely symbolic,\" she says, a way for states to \"allow women to exercise their constitutional rights, but under protest.\"  With the commitment of Trump and Pence to overturning Roe, these laws may no longer be only symbolic. Feigenholtz was motivated to try to undo Illinois' trigger law before any Supreme Court decision, but Texas state Sen. Bob Hall had the opposite idea: He introduced a new trigger law earlier this month. \"I think there might be a real possibility that a Supreme Court in the near future just might overturn Roe v. Wade,\" Hall told the Houston Chronicle. \"If they were to do that, then this would put in place in Texas that abortions would be illegal.\" (Hall's office did not respond to requests for comment from Mother Jones.)  The process of overturning Roe and removing the constitutional guarantee of the right to an abortion is not a given and would take some time. With the need for another opening on the Supreme Court, a confirmation process for a new justice, and a strong case that would move through the lower courts, Feigenholtz acknowledges that the Illinois trigger law would likely not be activated in the immediate future. But with the Senate confirmation process for Judge Neil Gorsuch set to begin sometime in MarchTrump's first step toward building a conservative majority on the high courtshe is concerned about a return to \"frightening times.\"  \"There will be an immediate harm to women.\"  \"I just turned 60. I remember a lot. I remember pooling money for friends and putting them on buses and sending them to New York. Women were having abortions unsafely and dying in sepsis units in hospitals,\" she says. \"If it's in the statute, women are at risk.\"  If the Supreme Court did overturn Roe, the enforceability of these trigger clauses is complicated and difficult to predict, Kraiem explains. For instance, six statesArkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohioenshrine only their intention to revert back to pre-Roe policies, without requiring an automatic switch. Since a number of those legislatures tend to skew conservative, that intention could very quickly become law.  \"If you look at this list of states, there are a bunch where it would be easy to pass an abortion ban very, very quickly,\" says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that tracks abortion legislation.  All this legal uncertainty virtually guarantees that, in practice, the effect of trigger laws would be \"immediate\" Kraiem says. \"When all of a sudden, it may be illegal, there are going to be very few doctors willing to perform the procedure at that point,\" she says. \"It creates a chilling effect.\" Litigation would likely attempt to resolve what exactly each trigger law does and doesn't require, Kraiem says. But women who need to terminate pregnancies will not have the luxury of waiting for legal resolution. \"There will be an immediate harm to women,\" she says.  Feigenholtz' proposed bill to protect abortion access in Illinois in the event of Roe's demise also has implications for women across the Midwest. In recent years, women from neighboring states have increasingly sought abortion care in Illinois, because their home states have enacted some of the country's toughest restrictions on abortion. Missouri, for instance, has only one remaining abortion clinic, while Ohio and Wisconsin both have mandatory pre-abortion waiting periods and ultrasound requirements, prohibitions on public funding for most abortions, 20-week abortion bans, and more. In 2016, Planned Parenthood of Illinois saw a spike in visits from residents of neighboring states, especially from Indiana, where as governor, Vice President Pence enacted a slew of abortion restrictions, including a prohibition on women choosing abortion because of fetal disability and a requirement that aborted fetuses be buried or cremated. More than half of all Illinois Planned Parenthood visits from Pence's home state in 2016 were for abortions.  Personal PAC, which works to advance reproductive rights in Illinois, helped gather more than 8,000 statements in support of Feigenholtz's bill, which passed out of committee last week and will now go to the Illinois House for a vote. Personal PAC's president and CEO, Terry Cosgrove, says that in the event that Roe is overturned, he believes the courts would ultimately find trigger clauses enforceable. \"In the age of Donald Trump,\" he says, \"I don't think we can count on the judiciary.\"", "date": "2017/02/14", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/abortion-law-youve-never-heard-could-be-threat-during-trump-era", "title": "If Trump Gets His Way, These Will Be the First Places to Ban Abortion"}, {"text": "In December, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that would prohibit states from withholding federal fundsincluding Title X family planning moneyfrom Planned Parenthood. On Monday afternoon, a Republican senator introduced a bill that would reverse it, along with a second bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal fundingincluding Medicaid.  The bills, from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), would redirect federal funds away from Planned Parenthood to other health care providers. The Hyde Amendment already prohibits federal funds from being used for most abortions, but this legislation would bar low-income women who rely on Medicaid and Title X funding for subsidized care from obtaining other women's health care services at Planned Parenthood.  \"With a pro-life president in the White House and pro-life majorities in the House and Senate, we will continue to work together this year to undo the damage done by the Obama administration,\" wrote Ernst and Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner on Friday, the day of the annual anti-abortion March for Life.  The text of one of the bills, S 241, explains that other entities, including \"state and county health departments, community health centers, [and] hospitals,\" will be able to fill women's health care needs, including contraception, STI testing, and cervical and breast cancer screening. Many health experts say other health providers would not be able to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. An analysis conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, which publishes research on reproductive health, found that in two-thirds of the counties that have a Planned Parenthood center, these centers serve at least half the women seeking publicly funded contraceptive care. In one-fifth of those counties, Planned Parenthood is the only provider offering subsidized contraceptive care.  \"If passed, these bills will cause a national health care crisis, leaving millions with nowhere to go for basic care,\" said Dana Singiser, vice president of public policy and government affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement.  Texas offers an example of what women's health care looks like when Planned Parenthood is excluded from public funding. In 2011, the state stopped state funds from going to Planned Parenthood, leading to numerous clinic closures. Other health centers attempted to step in, but Medicaid contraception claims declined by 35 percent, suggesting that fewer low-income women were obtaining contraceptive care. There was also an increase in childbirths among women receiving Medicaid who'd previously received contraception from Planned Parenthood clinics.  A bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed both chambers of Congress last year, but was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama. Trump is likely to sign Ernst's version of this bill should it cross his desk: Throughout his campaign, Trump promised that defunding the women's health care provider would be a priority for his administration.

But as he built his $2.5 billion fortune, Ross and his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., have faced several lawsuits and regulatory actions accusing them of financial misconduct, including breach of fiduciary duty and fraud. His controversial business record received some scrutiny during his confirmation process. But one recent lawsuit involving Ross has garnered little attention. And it raises serious ethical questions about the business dealings of the billionaire who, if confirmed by the Senate, will be in charge of promoting job creation and economic growth.  The case, filed in a Florida federal court, involved a publicly traded mortgage company called Ocwen Financial. Ross served as a board member for the firm. In 2013 and 2014, state and federal regulators targeted the company over allegations that it engaged in a variety of improper practices. Ocwen's stock plummeted, and shareholders suffered major losses. Its stock peaked in 2013 at about $56 per share, and the company is currently trading at about $5. But Ross managed to avoid millions in losses by off-loading his holdings in the company in two curiously timed trades that came shortly before damaging news was revealed that sent Ocwen shares into a tailspin. In the suit, shareholders accused Ross and other company directors of using inside information to enrich themselves and of leaving \"ethics, integrity, and fair dealing by the wayside in their quest for ever higher revenues and thus, higher compensation and ever more lucrative incentives for themselves.\"  The White House press office and Invesco (which is a corporate parent of WL Ross) did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Ocwen spokesman John Lovallo declined to respond to questions from Mother Jones, but he provided a statement about the company's corporate governance practices. \"Today, the composition, structure, experience and diversity of Ocwen's Board, which consists of eight members, seven of whom are independent directors, is as strong as any comparable financial services company,\" Lovallo wrote. \"Ocwen is recognized as the industry leader in responsible home retention through foreclosure prevention.\"  The suit charged that Ross, his firm, and its related funds \"profited handsomely at the Company's expense and thereby unjustly enriched themselves.\"  Ross' ties to Ocwen date back to October 2012, when the Atlanta-based company announced plans to acquire mortgage-servicing firm Homeward Residential Holdings from WL Ross & Co. for $766 million in cash and preferred stock. Six months later, Ross joined Ocwen's board.  The Homeward deal came during an Ocwen buying spree, as the company rapidly scooped up the mortgage-servicing units of big banks and other financial firms following the housing crisis. (Mortgage services are not lenders, but they collect loan payments and initiate foreclosure proceedings if homeowners default.) Ocwen's business practicesincluding allegations that it had prematurely foreclosed on homeowners and mishandled loan modificationsplaced the company on the radar of regulators, including the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The agency held up the Homeward sale until December 2012, when Ocwen agreed to two years of independent monitoring to ensure that \"reforms are implemented and homeowners have a real chance to avoid foreclosure,\" according to the agencys head, Benjamin Lawsky.  In their lawsuita consolidated version of several previously initiated lawsuits was filed in federal court in March 2016the Ocwen shareholders presented a timeline that they claimed supported their allegations. Through the sale of Homeward, Ross and his firm had received $162 million in Ocwen shares. In September 2013, Ross, on behalf of his private equity firm, sold more than 3.1 million Ocwen shares, at $50.19 a share, netting almost $158 million. Three months later, in December, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that Ocwen had agreed to pay $2.1 billion to settle charges of mortgage-servicing misconduct dating back to 2009, including hitting homeowners with unauthorized fees and deceiving consumers about foreclosure alternatives and loan modifications. As part of the settlement, Ocwen did not admit to or deny the CFPB's allegations. Soon afterward, Ocwen's stock had dropped to $44.14 per share, and it continued its downward slide from there.  The following year, WL Ross sold another large block of Ocwen stock. Once again, the sale came shortly before negative news was announced that sharply affected Ocwen's stock. On July 14, 2014, WL Ross sold nearly 2 million Ocwen shares back to the company at about $37 a share, netting $72.1 million. On July 31, the company reported poor quarterly returns and within days its shares fell in value by more than 20 percent. Ocwen blamed its subpar earnings on the rising costs of complying with NYDFS' required monitoring. On August 4, the NYDFS announced it was probing Ocwen for requiring homeowners to pay for \"forced-placed insurance\"insurance that is taken out by the lender. By the end of December, Ocwen stock had sunk to about $15 per share. Due to the timing of his trade, Ross and his company avoided $18 million in losses. (The NYDFS investigation led to a broader December 2014 settlement, in which Ocwen agreed to pay a $150 million fine.)  Ross, the suit maintained, was in a particular position to know about Ocwen's mounting regulatory issues because he was a member of the board's compliance committee.  Other Ocwen shareholders were not as lucky as Ross and his firm. Three Ocwen shareholders subsequently filed lawsuits against Ross and other company directors. The subsequently consolidated lawsuit alleged that Ross and two other members of the board of directors ignored \"systemic and ongoing\" wrongdoing by Ocwen. It claimed that the misconduct had ultimately cost the company more than $2 billion, and that Ross and his co-defendants \"sold their personal holdings of Ocwen stock_while having knowledge of material, adverse inside information, in violation of state and federal law and in breach of their fiduciary duties to the Company.\" And the suit charged that Ross, his firm, and its related funds \"profited handsomely at the Company's expense and thereby unjustly enriched themselves.\" Ross, the suit maintained, was in a particular position to know about Ocwen's mounting regulatory issues because he was not just a company director but a member of the board's compliance committee.  Ross and fellow members of this committee had \"total access to all documents and information bearing upon the Company's operations,\" the complaint alleged. And they were \"personally aware or should have been aware that the Company was not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including_applicable state and federal consumer protection laws and regulations and the multiple agreements and consent decrees made with Ocwen's regulators, which were regularly breached by the company.\"  Despite their knowledge of the company's financial condition, mortgage-servicing misconduct, and ongoing regulatory actions, Ross and other company directors signed their names to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in March 2014 affirming that Ocwen was successfully managing its regulatory obligations and reiterating the company's \"previously-announced financial results and financial positions,\" according to the complaint.  Ocwen settled the suit in December on behalf of Ross and the other directors, agreeing to pay up to $2.2 million in attorney's fees and other expenses and to institute a range of corporate governance reforms. As part of the settlement, Ross and the other defendants did not deny or acknowledge wrongdoing.  Lawrence Harris, one of the Securities and Exchange Commission's chief economists during the George W. Bush administration and now a finance professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall business school, said that because the Ocwen case was settled instead of going to trial, it is unclear what Ross knew at the time that he made his trades. \"When confronted with the fortuitous timing of his sale, careful observers will certainly ask themselves whether Ross had knowledge as to what was going to happen,\" Harris says. \"If his knowledge was obtained through his insight, then he's simply a disciplined investor. But if his knowledge was obtained through his position as director of the firm, of course there would be substantial concerns of the ethics of his subsequent sale.\"  Harris says Ross' combined history leaves lingering questions.  \"If you had two otherwise identical candidates [for commerce secretary], one has this record, the other one doesn't, there's no question that you would prefer the candidate who doesn't have the record,\" he says. \"At some point you have to ask yourself, if you have a candidate with this type of record, who exactly are we dealing with?\"", "date": "2017/01/26", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-commerce-secretary-nominee-wilbur-ross-insider-trading-allegations", "title": "This Insider Trading Case Raises Troubling Questions About Trump's Commerce Secretary Nominee"}, {"text": "Update, January 24, 5:05 p.m. The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act passed the House by a vote of 238-183. The bill must now be voted on by the Senate.  Since the 1970s, the Hyde Amendment has prohibited the use of federal funds for abortions. The rule has always functioned as a budget rider attached to individual federal appropriations bills. But as early as Tuesday, the House could vote to make it permanent. If members of the House approve the bill, they'll be moving on what has long been a priority for anti-abortion groups just days after the Women's Marches, in which millions of Americans demonstrated against President Donald Trump in what may have been the largest protest in US history. Enshrining the Hyde Amendment into law was one of Trump's primary campaign promises to the pro-life movement.  The bill, dubbed the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, would prohibit the use of any federal funds to pay for abortion or for health benefit plans that include abortion coverage. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), the bill's author, proposed a similar version of the legislation in 2013 and 2015. Both versions passed the House but not the Senate.  The Hyde Amendment has always impacted low-income women the mostit makes it impossible to use Medicaid funding for almost all abortions. But as a budget rider, the amendment has to be renewed by Congress every year. If Smith's bill becomes law, that would no longer be the case; the prohibition would become permanent and could only be reversed through new legislation in the future. If the bill were to make it to the Senate, it would require 60 votes to pass; there are 52 Republican senators.  Kristan Hawkins, the presidents of Students for Life, told the Washington Times that Congress and the administration's speed in moving to enshrine the Hyde Amendment inspires confidence that anti-abortion laws will be a priority for Trump.  \"We applaud Speaker Ryan and the House of Representatives for starting the process to make the Hyde Amendment permanent law,\" she said. \"This is a great sign that the Trump administration plans to follow through on their promises during the campaign, and we look forward to working together to make abortion unthinkable in this nation.\"  Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), co-chair of the House Pro-Choice Caucus, told Mother Jones that she is \"not terribly surprised\" at the speed with which the bill has come up for a vote. \"But it does seem like a slap in the face after we had over a million women marching in Washington and around the country,\" DeGette said.", "date": "2017/01/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/house-representatives-trump-hyde-amendment", "title": "The House Just Handed a Big Win to the Anti-Abortion Movement"}, {"text": "Earlier this month, then-President Barack Obama issued an executive action requiring the Federal Housing Administration to decrease insurance premiums on FHA mortgages, a change that could have potentially saved low-income homeowners as much as $900 per year. In his first administrative order as president, President Donald Trump suspended this Obama order, which was slated to go into effect on January 27.

The borrowers have to pay FHA mortgage insurance, to protect the mortgage lender from a loss should the borrower default on their home loan. In his announcement of the change, Obama said the drop in premiums would help stabilize the housing market and spur growth in housing markets still recovering from the financial crisis.  At his confirmation hearing last week, Ben Carson, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the FHA, said he was concerned about the Obama administration's last-minute implementation of this insurance premium drop and would reexamine it. \"I, too, was surprised to see something of this nature done on the way out the door,\" Carson told members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. \"Certainly, if confirmed, I'm going to work with the FHA administrator and other financial experts to really examine that policy.\"  Presidential executive orders require no congressional approval to pass or overturn.

After the press conference, Russian journalist Alexey Kovalev, speaking from his own experience, published a letter to the US press on Medium about what to expect from Trump's behavior toward journalists:  Congratulations, US media! You've just covered your first press conference of an authoritarian leader with a massive ego and a deep disdain for your trade and everything you hold dear. We, in Russia, have been doing it for 12 years now with a short hiatus when our leader wasnt technically our leader  so quite a few things during Donald Trump's press conference rang my bells.  One additional point of comparison: The leaders' disrespect for facts. \"You can't hurt this man with facts or reason.

Among the most pervasive have been 20-week abortion bans: Ohio and Kentucky have both passed these in the last month, and they have been proposed in Virginia and now Florida.  On Tuesday, Florida state Rep. Joe Grutersthe former co-chair of Trump's Florida campaign who began his first term in the Florida House this monthfiled the proposed ban, along with sponsor Rep. Don Hahnfeldt.  \"Proud to stand up for life in the first bill that I file as a member of the State House,\" Gruters wrote on his Facebook page.  Titled the \"Florida Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\" the bill would make it a third-degree felony to perform an abortion after 20 weeks, unless there is a \"serious health risk\" for the mother. The bill would also require doctors to file a report about every abortion they perform to the state's health department and would allow the fathers of the unborn, as well as mothers, to sue their abortion providers for actual or punitive damages.  The bill's text argues that the ban is necessary because at 20 weeks, fetuses can feel pain. This point is contested by pro-choice advocates and refuted by the vast majority of scientific research.  The Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade ruled that a state can only ban abortions after a fetus is viable outside the womb, which is typically considered to be at 24 weeks. The 20-week bans have been one of the anti-abortion movement's primary strategies for challenging Roe, by calling into question its viability standard. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions take place after 20 weeks, and they usually occur because of an unforeseen medical complicationa risk to the mother's health, for instance, or the discovery of a severe fetal anomaly in the later stages of pregnancy. They might be necessary for women experiencing major difficulties in their lives, such as domestic violence or the inability to access abortion for financial and other reasons. \"Such bans will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources,\" wrote the authors of a 2013 study on women who get later abortions.  \"The 20-week ban was nationally designed to be the vehicle to end abortion in America,\" Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis told the Columbus Dispatch in December, following the state's passage of its own 20-week ban.  Lawsuits challenging these bans have made it all the way to the US Supreme Court. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to review a case challenging Arizona's 20-week ban, cementing a lower court's decision that the law was unconstitutional. Reproductive rights advocates have also mounted lawsuits opposing 20-week bans passed in several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia.  Perhaps in anticipation of similar lawsuits to come, Florida's proposed 20-week ban would also establish a legal defense fund, financed with taxpayer dollars and private donations, which would be managed by Florida's legal affairs department and would pay for the state attorney general's legal defense against challenges to the bill.  Florida Gov. Rick Scott has not said publicly whether he would support a 20-week abortion ban. But he identifies as pro-life and in the past has supported other restrictions on later abortions. In 2014, Scott signed a bill into law redefining fetal viability to when a fetus can survive outside the womb \"through standard medical measures,\" further limiting when some later abortions would be permitted.", "date": "2017/01/12", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/yet-another-state-takes-aim-new-abortion-ban", "title": "The Post-Trump Wave of Anti-Abortion Proposals Just Hit Florida"}, {"text": "In November's election, Republican Eric Greitens was elected to replace Democrat Jay Nixon as governor, making Missouri one of four states with a new trifecta in which the GOP controls all branches of government. Wasting no time, Missouri lawmakers prefiled 14 anti-abortion bills for the legislative session that started Wednesday.  The proposals include a personhood bill, religious liberty protections for crisis pregnancy centers, several measures blocking fetal tissue research, a chemical endangerment bill, and a bill regarding fetal burial similar to those passed this year in Indiana and Texas.  \"I believe that the Republican leadership wants to focus on other issues that are priorities,\" says Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri. \"But the legislators who are obsessed with further restricting access to abortion_are emboldened by the new Republican trifecta. They might be emboldened by the new Trump presidency.\"  In Missouri, it is not unusual for lawmakers to prepare many abortion bills before the legislative session begins, but since 2014 lawmakers have never prefiled more than 10 bills. \"This legislative session is going to be the fight of our lives,\" said Elise Higgins, interim director of public policy and organizing at Planned Parenthood Great Plains, the regional affiliate that provides care in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.  The state has a long history of curbing access to abortion. Between 2011 and 2015, political pressure and abortion restrictions shut down four providers, and now only one abortion clinic remains to serve Missouri's more than 2 million women. Year after year, legislators have filed dozens of anti-abortion proposals31 in 2014, 27 in 2015, and 28 last yearwith mixed success. The Show-Me State has also been a testing ground for new approaches to restricting abortiona legacy that dates back to the 1989 Webster case decided by the Supreme Court. That ruling, which upheld a Missouri abortion law, allowed states to impose far more restrictions on abortion care than had previously been permitted under Roe v. Wade. This is what gives the current list of measures potential for national consequences.  Here are the bills that have been proposed so far:  HB58: The bill would require the state's health department to rank facilities that deal with maternal care and high-risk pregnancies and would prohibit the department from considering facilities' rates of abortion or referral for abortion in these rankings. In practice, this means the facilities designated as those with the best care may in fact not offer abortion or present it as an option to patients.  HB112: This measure relates to custody disputes over embryos conceived by in-vitro fertilization and, if passed, would require courts to grant custody to those parties who intend to gestate the embryos, rather than the party intending to dispose of them. Courts could no longer issue judgments in custody disputes that permit embryos to be terminated or \"kept indefinitely in an environment in which it does not develop or grow.\" Advocates consider this a personhood measure. \"One could argue that if you're giving personhood protections to frozen embryos, that would apply to other areas of law,\" says M'Evie Mead, director of policy and organizing at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missourian advocacy group. The provision is also worrisome to groups focused on infertility and assisted reproductive technologies because of the unforeseen consequences it could create for embryos conceived through IVF.  HB147: This bill would require women who have had abortions to choose how the fetal remains are disposed of, including the option of cremation or burial, and mark their choice on a specific health department form. NARAL's Dreith considers this one measure that, if passed, could reverberate nationally. In 2016, both Indiana and Texas passed bills requiring that fetal remains from abortions be interred or cremated, but both bills were temporarily blocked by federal judges. (The latest hearing regarding the Texas bill began on Tuesday.) Missouri's proposal is different because it doesn't require fetal remains to be cremated or buriedinstead it offers these methods among a list of disposal options, and simply requires women who have abortions to choose from the list. This concession, Dreith says, \"is not as ugly on the public service level_[but] this bill could be replicable in other states that don't want to be as vulgar as Texas.\"  HB174 and SB41: These two bills  filed simultaneously in the House and Senatewould provide free speech and religious liberty protections for crisis pregnancy centers. Often unregulated, these facilities are usually religiously affiliated and discourage women from having abortions, frequently by touting medically inaccurate claims about abortion, including that abortion causes breast cancer or that it causes psychological damage.  filed simultaneously in the House and Senatewould provide free speech and religious liberty protections for crisis pregnancy centers. Often unregulated, these facilities are usually religiously affiliated and discourage women from having abortions, frequently by touting medically inaccurate claims about abortion, including that abortion causes breast cancer or that it causes psychological damage. HB182: This measure makes it a felony for an adult to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion, with an exception for parents or adults who have obtained consent from a minor's parents.  HB194 and SB67: These bills would make it illegal to donate fetal tissue to any kind of research. Fetal tissue has been critical to medical advancements in many realms, from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's to the polio vaccine. This bill would also complicate the disposal of fetal tissue, requiring a multistep process that would culminate in a report prepared by the health department for the Missouri General Assembly that includes data on every fetal tissue disposal that took place in the state.  HB252: The bill would make it a crime for a woman to use narcotics or a controlled substance without a prescription if she is pregnant or she \"knows or reasonably should have known\" that she is pregnant. The crime would be classified as a felony of \"endangering the welfare of a child in the first degree,\" which is punishable by up to four years in prison, according to Missouri law.  HB326: This would require notification of both parents when a minor seeks an abortion, in addition to consent by one parent, which is already required by Missouri law.  SB15: This bill reauthorizes existing state tax credits for those making charitable donations to maternity homes and crisis pregnancy centers.  SB96: This measure would make it a misdemeanor for doctors to perform abortions on women who are seeking the procedure due to the sex, race, or Down syndrome diagnosis of the fetus.  SB196: This bill would give the state attorney general jurisdiction to enforce abortion lawsa power that is currently held by county-level prosecutors. This measure was last attempted by Missouri lawmakers in 2014. The bill's return follows November's election of Josh Hawley as Missouri's attorney general. Hawley was a member of the legal team that argued Burwell v. Hobby Lobby before the Supreme Court in 2014the case that cemented an exception for religious employers from the Affordable Care Act's required contraceptive coverage. The bill's sponsor, state Sen. Andrew Koenig, did not respond to a request for comment about whether this bill's introduction and Hawley's election are related.  SB230: This would require an abortion facility providing contact information for an out-of state abortion clinic to also provide documents about informed consent. These include information about possible fetal pain during abortion (scientific consensus is that such fetal pain claims are false), alternatives to abortion, and child support requirements for fathers.  In the past, most of the anti-abortion bills proposed have not become law, blocked at times by Missouri's Democratic governor. Missouri's new governor, Greitens, has not been vocal about his views on abortion, beyond noting that he is pro-life on his campaign website. But should bills cross his desk, advocates like Dreith believe he is likely to sign them. \"I don't think abortion is a major priority for him,\" Dreith said. \"But the anti-choice Republicans we have in our Legislature will be emboldened by Trump and by knowing that they have a governor that is probably going to support them in their efforts should something pass.\"", "date": "2017/01/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/new-gop-control-missouri-primed-anti-abortion-blitz-2017", "title": "A Wave of Anti-Abortion Laws Is About to Hit This State"}, {"text": "As two congressional committees began their work on the House Republicans' health care law Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office does not need to analyze the bill before Congress starts working on it. As long as the CBO releases its predictions about the bill's impact on the insurance market and the economy before the House votes on it, Ryan said, the process will abide by standard procedure.  But Ryan had a different view eight years ago, when Democrats were crafting the Affordable Care Act. In June 2009, Ryan sent a letter to the CBO asking that it analyzeor \"score\"the bill in advance of committee mark-ups. \"Given the stated intention of the Majority to have Committees consider this legislation during the week of July 6, we ask that you please provide a preliminary cost estimate on this legislation by Monday, July 6,\" stated the letter, signed by Ryan and three other senior Republicans.  A lot has changed in eight years. Whereas Republicans once complained that Democrats had rushed the passage of health care reform, today the Republican process is moving at warp speed. House Republicans kept their bill secret until Monday night, then scheduled two simultaneous mark-ups less than 48 hours later without CBO scoring, and hope to pass the whole thing next month. As Congress once again dives into the reform process, Republicans are rewriting the history of how the Affordable Care Act passed.  Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) on Tuesday claimed that Obamacare was \"written in the dark of night and rushed through Congress\"a retelling that is clearly untrue. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has also, repeatedly, misrepresented how the Affordable Care Act passed. During Tuesday's press briefing, Spicer four times repeated one of his favorite phrases about the Affordable Care Act, that Democrats had \"jammed\" their bill down people's \"throat.\" He also brought up a statement from then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the time \"We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it\"to imply that Democrats hid the contents of the law from the public until it passed.  Spicer said Tuesday, \"Unlike before, as I mentioned, when the Democrats jammed it down people's throat and saidwaited to get that 60th vote, with Sen. [Ted] Kennedy still around, and then basically said, 'literally, you will have to wait and see what it looks like before we passed itwe not only posted it out there for everybody to look at, but by sending it through regular order, not just putting it up for a House vote, but sending it through the committee process, allows Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike to offer up amendments and suggestions.\"  This characterization of the passage of the Affordable Care Act bears little resemblance to what actually happened. Democrats spent a year crafting and passing health care reform in 2009 and 2010. Along the way, they spent hundreds of hours debating the bill in committee hearings, with copious input from the CBO. The Senate did not pass the bill with the help of Kennedy, who died in August 2009; Paul Kirk, who was appointed to replace him, voted for the bill.  Pelosi's comment did not refer literally to hiding the contents of the legislation, which would have been impossible, because at the time Pelosi made the remark in March 2010, the full text of the bill had been debated, publicly, for months and was two weeks away from becoming law. Rather, Pelosi was expressingperhaps inartfullyher hope that once the bill passed, misinformation about reform would subside and Americans would learn about the law's benefits.  \"You've heard about the controversies within the bill, the process about the bill, one or the other,\" Pelosi said in March 2010. \"But I don't know if you have heard that it is legislation for the future, not just about health care for America, but about a healthier America, where preventive care is not something that you have to pay a deductible for or out of pocket. Prevention, prevention, preventionit's about diet, not diabetes. It's going to be very, very exciting. But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.\"  Politico's headline from that night shows how the press initially interpreted it: \"Pelosi: People won't appreciate reform until it passes.\" But her prediction was slightly off. It turns out that people didn't fully appreciate Obamacare until it was at risk of repeal.", "date": "2017/03/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/paul-ryan-republicans-health-care-pelosi-spicer", "title": "Paul Ryan Demanded a Speedy Analysis of Obamacare.

Rod Rosenstein, the US attorney for Maryland, has been nominated for that job. If confirmed, he would oversee one of the most importantand politically sensitiveinvestigations in modern history. And Congress is using his nomination as a proxy debate for the question of whether an independent investigator should probe contacts between Donald Trump's campaign and Russian officials.  On Tuesday, Rosenstein appeared on Capitol Hill for his confirmation hearing, which quickly became a conversation about the need for a special counsel to oversee an investigation into the Trump-Russia communications. At times, the hearing grew tense as Democrats pressed the Republican committee chairman over Sessions' misleading testimony to the committee in January, when he falsely claimed he had not had any contact with Russian officials.  The first question out of the gate, from Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), tackled this question head on. \"Have you ever met with representatives of the Russian government?\" he asked Rosenstein. Rosenstein could not recall such a meeting. Grassley then asked whether Rosenstein knew of any reason that he, too, would have to recuse himself from such an investigation. Rosenstein said he did not know of any.  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), whose question prompted Sessions' misleading testimony in January, posed the exact same question to Rosenstein: If there is evidence of communication between people involved in the Trump campaign and Russian officials or intermediaries, \"what will you do?\" Rosenstein promised an investigation.  But Rosenstein repeatedly demurred on whether he would appoint a special counsel. When pressed by Democrats on the committee, he said he did not yet have the information needed to make that decision.  Democrats on the committee repeatedly stated their preference that a special counsel oversee any investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told Rosenstein that he would vote against his confirmation if he did not commit to appointing a special prosecutor. \"How can you investigate your boss?\" he questioned, noting that Sessions' contacts with the Russian ambassador while an adviser to the Trump campaign could make him a witness in an investigation. Grassley dismissed calls for a special counsel as a partisan exercise because Democrats did not make the same demand of investigations into Hillary Clinton's email server and foundation.  The hearing grew tense when Franken called for Sessions to return to the committee to clarify his testimony from eight weeks ago. \"He should come back and explain himself, Mr. Chairman,\" he said. \"I have bent over backward not to say that he lied.\" This angered Grassley, who accused Franken of being unfair to Sessions. \"I consider what Sen.

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) asked whether Rosenstein would resign in protest if he believed an investigation was shut down or stonewalled for political purposes, and whether he would publicize the reason for his resignation. Rosenstein tentatively agreed that such a course could be appropriate.  A career prosecutor, Rosenstein is respected on both sides of the aisle. Though he was a member of the conservative Federalist Society while at Harvard Law School, he has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations and has maintained a reputation for being nonpartisan in his role as US attorney of Maryland and throughout his career.  Rosenstein began his career at the Justice Department in 1990, prosecuting corruption cases with the Public Integrity Section. During this time, he was tapped by Kenneth Starr to join the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's real estate dealings. In 1997, he became an assistant US attorney in Maryland. From 2001 to 2005, he served as a top attorney in the Justice Department's Tax Division, until President George W. Bush made him the top federal prosecutor in Maryland in 2005. Two years later, Bush nominated him to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, but Maryland's two Democratic senators blocked his confirmation, though they praised his work as a prosecutor.  When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, he eventually replaced nearly all of Bush's US attorney appointments. Rosenstein was one of just three who kept their jobs under Obama. \"He doesn't make any decisions that either are or appear to be political,\" David Cole, who served as deputy attorney general under Obama, told The Guardian recently.", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/deputy-attorney-general-confirmation-russia-trump", "title": "Democrats Press Justice Nominee to Commit to Special Prosecutor in Russia Probe"}, {"text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions will recuse himself from any investigations into contact between the Russian government and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Sessions announced at a press conference Thursday afternoon.

That decision would presumably be left to acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente.  The hastily called press conference came as lawmakers from both parties called for Sessions to recuse himself from any investigations into Russia's role in the election. During Sessions' confirmation hearing, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked him what he would do if reports that Trump campaign associates and Russian officials had been in contact during the campaign turned out to be true. Sessions responded by denying that he had any contact with the Russians: \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I didn't havedid not have communications with the Russians.\" But on Wednesday, news broke that Sessions had twice met with the Russian ambassador.  As reporters waited for Sessions to begin his press conference at DOJ headquarters Thursday, televisions tuned to CNN replayed the exchange with Frankenfollowed by a segment with the chyron, \"Calls grow for attorney general to resign.\"  When he took the podium shortly after 4 p.m., Sessions claimed that he was innocent of any wrongdoing and had not purposefully misled the Senate during his confirmation hearing. \"My reply to the question of Sen. Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time,\" he said.  Sessions said he would be writing to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the next day or two to explain his testimony. He added that his decision to remove himself from any investigations into the 2016 presidential campaign came following his review of ethics rules and input from his staff. \"In the end, I have followed the right procedure, just as I promised the committee I would,\" he said.  As for his September meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his Senate office, Sessions said he didn't recall many details, before naming terrorism and Ukraine as topics that came up. Sessions also said he and Kislyak had discussed a visit Sessions paid to a Russian church in 1991 and that Kislyak had told him he was not religious. \"I thought he was pretty much an old-style Soviet ambassador,\" Sessions said.

In 2011, Texas passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, requiring government-issued identification, such as a passport, driver's license, military ID, or weapons permit in order to cast a ballot. The law did not allow voting with a university-issued ID. A federal court would later find that 608,470 registered voters in Texas, many of them young and minority voters, now lacked the identification needed to vote. A different federal district court blocked the law on the basis that it discriminates against minority voters.  But in 2013, after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Texas moved to implement its law. In response, the Justice Department, along with civil rights groups, lawmakers, and several individual voters, sued the state, arguing that the law had a discriminatory effect and was passed with a discriminatory purpose. A district court agreed with their claim. On appeal, the conservative Fifth Circuit Court likewise found that the law had a discriminatory effect but sent the case back to the lower court to relitigate the question of discriminatory intent.  This is a very important piece of the case: A finding of discriminatory effect necessitates softening the law, but a finding of discriminatory intent would allow the judge to throw it out entirely. According to election law expert Rick Hasen, a discriminatory intent finding could also \"provide a predicate, under Section 3 of the [Voting Rights] Act, to put Texas back under federal supervision for up to 10 years.\" That means Texas would have to seek federal approval before making any future changes to voting laws and procedures.  On Monday evening, the Justice Department withdrew its claim of discriminatory intent and asked the court to suspend ruling on the intent issue until the state legislature can amend the law.  The Texas law put up significant barriers to the ballot for many voters, including some of the same people whose rights Sessions declared had been restored by the Justice Department. Take the story of Elizabeth Gholar, an elderly voter who grew up in the Jim Crow South. As The Nation's Ari Berman recounted recently, Gholar had to hire a lawyer before she could get Texas officials to grant her a voting-eligible identification card under the law. \"Voting is a right that everybody else had,\" she testified in federal court in 2014. \"And it's been taken away again.\"  Sessions, a former US senator from Alabama who has battled accusations of racism for years, was confirmed by the US Senate as attorney general despite vociferous opposition by civil rights groups and African American lawmakers who feared that Sessions would come down on the wrong side of civil rights and voting rights cases. Those fears are already being borne out.  On Tuesday, the same day Sessions promised to \"protect civil rights\" in honor of Black History Month, civil rights lawyers in Texas were arguing at a crucial hearing on the discriminatory intent issue. For the first time in the case, the Justice Department was not on their side.", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/jeff-sessions-promise-protect-civil-rights-voting-rights-texas", "title": "Sessions Promises to Protect Civil Rights While Retreating From Key Voting Rights Case"}, {"text": "Sometimes a gag is the best megaphone.  Senate Republicans banded together Tuesday night to block Sen.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) more than 30 years ago. But the move ignited a firestorm of resistance from Democrats, ensuring widespread attention to the letter itself. Prohibited from reading the letter in the Senate, Warren first discussed the episode on MSNBC and then, shortly before midnight, read it on Facebook Live to an audience of more than 2 million people.

The Republican committee chair at the time, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, never entered it into the record, and it was published for the first time last month. When Warren read the sentence, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens,\" McConnell objected, citing a rule that prohibits senators from impugning each other.  \"I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,\" Warren responded. She appealed McConnell's objection, forcing the body to vote on the matter. Republicans, who control the chamber, provided 49 votes to rule her out of order, and Warren was forbidden to speak for the rest of the debate. \"She was warned,\" McConnell explained. \"She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\" By the end of the night, an online retailer was already selling T-shirts and sweaters with McConnell's remarks, as well as the hashtag #resist.

Ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on Sessions' nomination, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) tore into Sessions for his position on the Violence Against Women Act. Leahy, who until recently was the committee's ranking Democrat, deviated from his prepared remarks and grew emotional as he addressed his longtime committee colleague.  During Sessions' confirmation hearing earlier this month and in follow-up written questions, Leahy had pressed Sessions on his position on the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that mandated and funded prosecutions for violent crimes against women and established the Justice Department's Office of Violence Against Women, as well as on grant programs to provide resources to battered women. As Leahy noted Tuesday, the White House is reportedly using the conservative Heritage Foundation's budget blueprint, which \"calls for eliminating all Violence Against Women Act grants\" overseen by DOJ. Sessions voted against the most recent reauthorization of the act, in 2013, which expanded the law's protections to tribal lands, college students, and LGBT individuals. \"I would defend the statute if it's reasonably defensible,\" Sessions told Leahy during his January 10 confirmation hearing.  \"I asked Sen. Sessions to commit to stand up for women and preserve these critical programs,\" Leahy said in his prepared remarks. \"Again, he refused.\"  Then Leahy, a former prosecutor, strayed from his prepared remarks to describe a time before the Violence Against Women Act. \"I still have nightmares about some of the crime scenes I went to,\" he said with emotion. \"How could anybody who is going to be in a position to enforce our laws turn their back on that?

The senator from Alabama has stood by President Donald Trump on the issues that have generated a firestorm over the past week and drawn increasing condemnation from fellow Republicans in Congress: the refugee and travel ban and the false voter fraud allegations.  Yet when Sessions' nomination comes to a vote, beginning with a committee vote scheduled for Tuesday morning, he appears set to sail through. Senate Democrats would need to launch a major campaign against him in order to peel off members of the Republican majority and sink his nomination. Instead, at least one Democrat plans to vote for him, and no Senate Republicans have spoken out against him.  When Trump announced Sessions' nomination, civil rights groups quickly responded by highlighting past allegations that Sessions had made racist comments to African American colleagues and targeted black civil rights leaders in a failed voter fraud prosecution in the 1980s. But at his confirmation hearings this month, Republican senators defended his record on civil rights, few Democrats pressed him on the issue, and he emerged largely unscathed.  Trump's announcement last week of a \"massive investigation\" into voter fraud, based on the unsubstantiated claim that millions of illegally cast ballots had cost him the popular vote, once again brings Sessions' record on voting rights to the fore. As attorney general, Sessionswhose 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship was scuttled partly by questions about his prosecution of black voting rights advocateswould lead the Department of Justice as it may undertake an investigation that could serve to suppress voter turnout.  Then, on Friday, Trump signed an executive order halting the refugee resettlement program, banning Syrians from entering the country indefinitely, and banning anyone from six other Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. A federal judge quickly halted part of the order, and lawmakers from both parties spoke out against it. Several Republican senators have criticized the executive order but declared their support for Sessions. Susan Collins of Maine called the order's refugee ban \"overly broad\" and said that \"implementing it will be immediately problematic.\" Jeff Flake of Arizona noted, \"Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.\" And Ben Sasse of Nebraska said, \"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the US sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorists win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and this is America versus one religion.\"  Prior to the November election, Sessions served as the head of the Trump campaign's national security committee, and he defended Trump's proposal for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States as \"legitimate.\" He explained his position in an interview with the conservative website American Thinker last June. \"We have no duty to morally or legally admit people,\" he said. \"The Immigration Naturalization Act says the president can refuse entry to 'any alien or class of aliens he deems detrimental to the interests of the U.S.' It is appropriate to be aggressive in our vetting.\" Sessions went on to describe an immigration policy clearly targeted at Muslims, based on questions like whether people seeking to enter the country \"believe in Sharia law or the Constitution.\" Sessions finished with a warning against Islam: \"We need to use common sense with the who-what-where of the threat. It is the toxic ideology of Islam.\"  This position wasn't new for Sessions. It was an approach to immigration and refugee settlement that he had advocated as a senator. For years, Sessions was an adamant opponent of President Barack Obama's refugee program. He objected to allowing refugees from Muslim-majority countries and opposed giving large numbers of Muslims permanent legal residence in the United States. Sessions' communications chief Stephen Miller took this message to the Trump campaign and now serves as a policy adviser in the White House. As the Daily Beast's Betsy Woodruff pointed out, Sessions and Miller spent years making the case that Obama's refugee program presented a terror threat, and Miller conducted hours of research to try to connect refugees in the United States to terrorist activity. Sessions said on the Senate floor in November 2015, shortly before Miller joined Trump's campaign, \"It is an unpleasant but unavoidable fact that bringing in a large unassimilated flow of migrants from the Muslim world creates the conditions possible for radicalization and extremism to take hold.\" The New York Times reported that Miller was involved in drafting Trump's refugee and travel ban.  On the president's voter fraud conspiracy, Sessions has proved unwilling to buck Trump. During Sessions' confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) grilled him over the issue of voter fraud. \"Do you agree with President Trump that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the presidential election?\" he asked. Sessions declined to contradict Trump's claim and stated (wrongly) that fraud is a regular occurrence.  \"Sen. Franken, I don't know what the president-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement,\" Sessions said. \"I would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it. And I do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during election cycles.\"  Although Sessions has embraced the most controversial elements of Trump's agenda from his first full week in office, Democrats have shown little willingness to oppose his confirmation. That led former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer to tweet on Sunday:  We can't live in a world where Trump violates every norm and Democratic elected officials support people like Sessions out of courtesy https://t.co/Li1pkuX18P  Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) January 29, 2017  After a weekend of protests against Trump's executive order, Democratic lawmakers began plotting how to capitalize on that momentum to oppose Trump and his travel ban. This effort will likely include more opposition to his Cabinet nominees, as well as the Supreme Court nominee he plans to announce Tuesday night. The question is whether Senate Democrats make the Sessions vote part of their resistance.  \"I strongly believe this is a good litmus test of how serious you are about your concerns about the Muslim ban,\" says Faiz Shakir, political director for the ACLU.", "date": "2017/01/31", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/sessions-voter-fraud-muslim-ban-trump-confirmation", "title": "Sessions, a Staunch Ally on Trump's Most Controversial Moves, Appears Set for Confirmation"}, {"text": "By day, Joe Tien is a math professor at Ohio State University, where he studies the spread of infectious diseases. His research maps how a disease like Ebola jumps from village to village and plots the best way to stop its spread. On his own time, Tien has begun putting his skills in network science toward other subjects, including the connection between white nationalists and American politicians.  After the election, Tien and two other mathematicians set out to map the relationship between white nationalists and US senators on social media. The results produced one clear outlier: Based on an analysis of senators' Twitter followers, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), President Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, had the most overlap with white nationalist groups and individuals.  \"He's the closest of all senators to the white nationalist groups,\" says Tien.  Sessions has a controversial track record on matters of race, including allegations of racist comments toward black colleagues and the targeted prosecution of civil rights activists. But Tien was still surprised by the outcome of his research. He and his colleagues wrote a short paper on their findings and titled it \"The Curious Case of Jefferson Sessions.\"  Tien recently joined forces with UCLA mathematician Mason Porter and a third academic who wishes to remain anonymous to launch a new blog under the pseudonym Susan Bourbaki Anthony. (The name is a reference to suffragist Susan B. Anthony and an anonymous group of French mathematicians who published under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki in the 1930s.) The goal is to use their expertise to provide objective data about issues they believe are important and nonpartisan, such as voting rights and racial equality. They plan to post their code online so people can test and use it.  Their first project studied the overlap between the Twitter followers of white nationalists, Trump, and Breitbart News, the right-wing site whose former chairman is now Trump's top White House strategist. Unsurprisingly, they found that followers of white nationalists are very likely to follow both Trump and Breitbart. Trump, according to their analysis, actually has more overlap with white nationalist groups than with either political party.  For their second project on the relationship between white nationalists and politicians, Tien and his collaborators identified the Twitter accounts of seven white nationalist groups from the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of extremist organizations. They added two other Twitter accounts to their list: those of prominent white supremacist David Duke and the website The Right Stuff, which Tien learned about through white nationalist propaganda posted on bulletin boards at Ohio State University after the election.* Tien and his colleagues downloaded the list of all the followers of these nine accounts and of the 100 US senators, resulting in a network of about 11 million people. They then identified the overlap, or \"co-followership,\" between followers of white nationalist groups and individual senators.  This work isn't too far afield from Tien's day job. \"Rather than sets of communities or cities, we're looking at Twitter accounts,\" he explains. But in both cases, the patterns of connections create a network that can be mined for information.  Generally, the mathematicians' algorithms found that senators with large numbers of followers were less closely tied to white nationalists, because the co-followership represented a smaller percentage of their overall followers. But there was one exception: Sessions. \"Despite [his] reasonably large following,\" the authors wrote, \"the distance from Sessions to the white nationalist community was the closest of all senators.\"  At the time of the analysis, conducted a few weeks after the election, Sessions had about 86,000 followers, more than many of his colleagues. But he had high levels of co-followership with white nationalist groups. About 7 percent of the white nationalists' followers followed Sessions, compared to about 2 percent for the average senator, according to Tien.  Just five senators have a higher number of co-followers with white nationalist groups than Sessions. But unlike Sessions, each of those five has more than 1 million total followers, probably because they all ran for president at one time. These are Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and John McCain (R-Ariz.). When Tien ran his numbers, about 4 percent of Sessions followers also followed at least one of the nine white nationalist accounts. The average co-followership among all senators was about 1 percent. Paul had the highest number of co-followers, but they represented just 1 percent of his total Twitter following. The senator with the lowest co-followership, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), was at 0.08 percent.  Tien's analysis doesn't explain why followers of white nationalist groups also follow Sessions, and he acknowledges that it's not 100 percent airtight, since it may have factored in the accounts of bots and political reporters who follow white nationalists as part of their jobs. But it does demonstrate that Sessions draws significant interest from followers of prominent white nationalists. Despite Sessions' record on civil rights, which includes a hardline anti-immigration position, Tien says he was surprised by the findings. \"I didn't think it would show up in the Twitter space,\" he says. \"I wasn't sure that these guys were going to bother following Sessions.\"  Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated how The Right Stuff propaganda was disseminated.", "date": "2017/01/30", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/jeff-sessions-close-ties-white-nationalists-twitter", "title": "White Nationalists on Twitter Sure Do Love Jeff Sessions."}, {"text": "Hours after President Donald Trump tweeted that he'd launch a \"major investigation\" into massive voter fraud, of which there's no evidence, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday laid out a few details of what such an investigation might look like.

But on Wednesday, Spicer claimed that the legal team had actually only been discussing the three states where Stein pushed for recounts, not the entire country. \"I think there's a lot of states that we didn't compete in where that's not necessarily the case,\" he said, mentioning California and New York. \"I think that if you look at where a lot of potentiala lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states.

Instead, he named a study that does not back up the president's claims.  \"The president does believe that,\" Spicer said in response to a question about illegal voting. \"I think he's stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign. And he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.\"  Asked for specific evidence, Spicer replied, \"I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has.\"  This response spurred more questions from reporters throughout the briefing. NPR's Mara Liasson grilled Spicer on whether Trump will pursue an investigation. \"If 3 to 5 million people voted illegally, that is a scandal of astronomical proportions,\" she said. \"I'm asking you, why not investigate something that is the biggest scandal in American electoral history?\" Other reporters asked similar follow-up questions, but Spicer said there are currently no plans for an investigation.

There are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out, but our intention is never to lie to you.\" But the promise came as part of a combative exchange, during which Spicer introduced dubious claims about Trump's speech to the CIA on Saturday. And in response to questions about his own integrity, Spicer repeatedly blamed the press for being overly negative toward Trump.  Spicer brought up a mistake Time reporter Zeke Miller made on Friday, when he inaccurately reported that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. Spicer complained that Miller, who shortly after the mistaken report tweeted \"my apologies\" and \"apologies to my colleagues,\" had not sufficiently apologized.  \"Where was the apology to the president?\" Spicer asked. \"Where was the apology to millions of people who read that thought how racially insensitive that was?\" Earlier, however, Spicer appeared to accept Miller's multiple apologies:  Next, Spicer repeated his claim that there was intense excitement among CIA employees during Trump's highly political speech at CIA headquarters. Spicer claimed that the crowd of CIA officers had loudly cheered Trump, contradicting CBS News' report that the cheering came largely from an entourage of about 40 people that Trump's team brought to the address, not from CIA personnel. Spicer said Trump had only arrived at CIA with a very small group of peoplehe guessed 10 peopleand that the cheers had come from CIA employees.  Spicer headed into Monday's press briefing with his integrity in question, thanks to several demonstrably false statements he made to the press on Saturday evening (which were not the first time Spicer was caught in a lie.) Chief among them, Spicer wrongly asserted that the crowd at Trump's inauguration was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inaugurationperiodboth in person and around the globe.\"  Toward the end of Monday's lengthy press conference, Spicer conceded that the crowd in Washington was not the biggest ever and argued that he had never made such a claim. Instead, he said that by \"both in person and around the globe,\" he meant \"total largest audience.\" That's not how his words were broadly interpreted at the time, and it's not what Trump claimed in his speech at the CIA, where he stated, \"It looked like a million, million and a half people.\" (Experts in crowd estimation put the crowd size at a fraction of those numbers.)  Spicer also conceded that he had been wrong when he claimed Saturday that ridership on Washington's Metro system was higher than for President Barack Obama's second inauguration four years ago. \"At the time, the information I was provided by the inaugural committee came from an outside agency that we reported on,\" he said. \"And I think, knowing what we know now, we can tell that [Metro's] numbers are different.\"  When asked about crowd size and his decision to deliver Saturday's incorrect statement about it, Spicer repeatedly he returned to the idea that the administration is under attack by the media. \"It's about this constant, you know, 'He's not going to run,'\" Spicer said. \"Then if he runs, 'He's going to drop out.'

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) managed to make it through the first day and a half of confirmation hearings to be the next attorney general without many fireworks. That changed on Wednesday afternoon, when three of Sessions' African American colleagues in Congress testified against him.  Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon who nearly died fighting for African American voting rights; and Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, all gave testimony in opposition to Sessions. They told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions' record on everything from voting rights to mass incarceration made him unfit for the office of attorney general.  It is customary for members of Congress to testify first in congressional hearings, but committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) scheduled the three members for the end of the hearings. That discrepancy was not lost on the three testifying members. \"To have a senator, a House member, and a living civil rights legend testify at the end of all of this is the equivalent of being made to go to the back of the bus,\" said Richmond, to a smattering of applause.  Booker spoke first of the three, saying that although senators typically support one another, he found that tradition pitted against \"what my conscience tells me is best for my country.\" In his remarks, Booker said Sessions' record shows he will not adequately protect the rights of minorities. \"Sen. Sessions has not demonstrated a commitment to a central requirement of the job: to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights, and justice for all,\" Booker said, according to prepared remarks. \"In fact, at numerous times in his career, he has demonstrated a hostility toward these convictions, and has worked to frustrate attempts to advance these ideals.\"  His closing line was a play on a line often used by President Barack Obama, that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice. But Booker's version had a key difference. \"The arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice,\" he said. \"We must bend it.\" The country needs an attorney general, he said, who would bend it.  Lewis invoked his fight for voting rights in Alabama, where he endured a near-fatal beating on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. He described Alabama's evolution from a segregated place where he and Sessions both grew up under Jim Crow to ground zero of the successful fight for voting rights. He wondered whether Sessions' repeated calls for \"law and order\" today mean what they did before the civil rights movement, when that language represented a regime of segregation and oppression.  \"The forces of law and order in Alabama were so strong that to take a stance against this injustice we had to be willing to sacrifice our lives,\" Lewis said. When civil rights activists sacrificed themselves physically in Alabamasometimes with their livesPresident Lyndon Johnson and Congress responded by passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he noted. \"We made progress, but we are not there yet,\" he said. \"There are forces that would take us back to another place.\"  He added, \"We need someone who will stand up, speak up, and speak out for the people that need help.\"  The most pointed language came from Richmond. He spoke directly about the choice facing the senators, and particularly the Republican members who appear to have no reservations about confirming Sessions. \"Simply put, Sen. Sessions has advanced an agenda that would do great harm to African American citizens and communities,\" he said.  Richmond offered a warning to the senators. \"If you vote to confirm Sen. Sessions, you take ownership of everything he may do or not do,\" he said. \"Each and every senator who casts a vote to confirm Sen. Sessions will be permanently marked as a co-conspirator in an effort to move this country backward, toward a darker period in our shared history. So I ask you all, where do you stand?\"  The testimony from these three members of Congress was interspersed with input from two pro-Sessions witnesses, both black attorneys who have worked with Sessions.

This effort involved testimonials from senators, handouts from the Trump team, and efforts to change the narrative around Sessions' prosecution of civil rights advocates.  Sessions' 1986 hearings featured testimony alleging that Sessions had called a black colleague \"boy,\" described a white civil rights lawyer as a disgrace to his race, and labeled the ACLU and NAACP \"un-American\" organizations. Witnesses also testified about Sessions' unsuccessful prosecution of three black civil rights activists for voter fraud in 1985, a case that involved allegations of intimidation of rural black voters by law enforcement. Throughout Tuesday's hearing, Republicans actively tried to debunk these decades-old accusations and paint Sessions as an egalitarian who has been subject to a smear campaign by political opponents.  Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) kicked off the campaign when she introduced Sessions at the beginning of Tuesday's all-day hearing. Collins recounted a story about the late Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who voted against Sessions in 1986 but in 2009 said he regretted that vote \"because I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian.\" (Though deceased, Specter ended up being one of Sessions' key character witnesses on Tuesday; the nominee himself invoked Specter's comments as proof that he is not the racist \"caricature\" that Democrats made him out to be in 1986.) Collins then noted Sessions' prosecution in the early 1980s of two Ku Klux Klan members who had murdered a black teenager, Michael Donald, in Alabamathough an attorney who worked on the KKK murder case has claimed that Sessions initially did not want to pursue the caseand his appointment of a black lawyer as counsel in the Senate. \"These are not the actions of an individual who is motivated by racial animus,\" Collins said.  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told Sessions, \"We know your heart. We know what kind of person you are...You've got an outstanding record that you should be proud of.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) spent nearly 10 minutes describing Sessions' prosecution of the two Klansmen and urged the media to cover that story.  Sessions forcefully rebutted the charges of racism that have haunted him since 1986. \"I never declared that the NAACP was un-American or that a civil rights attorney was a 'disgrace to his race,'\" he said in his opening statement. He defended his failed prosecution of the three civil rights activists, known as the Marion Three, by saying he was defending the voting rights of African Americans who claimed their mail-in ballots had been tampered with. \"It was a voting rights case,\" he protested repeatedly. The New York Times on Monday recounted the history of that case, which bears all the markings of a prosecution aimed at suppressing the black vote. It only took the jury a few hours to return a verdict of not guilty.  \"Our country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their level of involvement on any given issue,\" said Sen. Al Franken.  While Sessions was rebutting \"the caricature that was created of me,\" the Trump transition team circulated a four-page handout to the press with the headline \"Fact Sheet: Prior Comment Allegations From the 1986 Hearing Have Been Discredit & Debunked.\" The handout attempted to reject some of the accusations that derailed Sessions' 1986 nomination, such as the allegation that he had referred to a black colleague as \"boy.\" It listed these comments under the heading \"myths\" and then rebutted them with quotes from Sessions and some of his associates under the heading \"facts.\" In some instances, the sole rebuttals provided were quotes of Sessions himself denying the claims.  A few minutes later, the transition team circulated a second handout. This heftier one purported to exonerate Sessions of any wrongdoing in the 1985 voter fraud case. It contained a letter from the son of an activist couple that Sessions had charged in that case who expressed his support for Sessions, as well as images of a few of the ballots used as evidence in the case. But nothing in the handout cast doubt on the view that the case was brought on thin grounds against three people who were helping African Americans vote in Alabama's Black Belt.  A third handout from the Trump team featured a list of civil rights cases and voter fraud prosecutions that Sessions was involved with in Alabama. All three handouts were prepared by a team of lawyers working for the Trump transition team on Sessions' confirmation, including three former Sessions staffers.  The only Democrat to fight back against this effort was Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota. Franken aimed to sow doubt about Sessions' characterization of his record on civil rights over the years, focusing on two times Sessions appears to have exaggerated his work on civil rights cases. The first was a 2009 interview in which he claimed to have filed \"20 or 30\" desegregation cases as a prosecutor in Alabama. He now admits it was a smaller number. The second is the written questionnaire Sessions submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the confirmation process. In that questionnaire, he listed four civil rights cases as among the 10 most significant cases he personally handled. But three former Justice Department lawyers who oversaw three of those cases claimed in an op-ed in the Washington Post that Sessions played virtually no role in them.  The Justice Department \"is facing real challenges, whether it's protecting civil rights or defending national security,\" Franken concluded, \"and our country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their level of involvement on any given issue.\" But misrepresentation and inflationor at least attempts at coordinated spinwere the theme of the day for Sessions' advocates.", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/gop-sets-out-rewrite-sessions-record-race", "title": "Republicans Try to Rewrite Sessions' History on Race"}, {"text": "Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) tore into his colleague Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) during Sessions' confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be the next attorney general, suggesting that Sessions has not honestly portrayed his record on civil rights to the public.  Republican senators and the Trump transition team made a concerted effort at the hearing to portray Sessions as an egalitarian whose reputation as a racist is unearned. But Franken's pointed questions cast doubt on that narrative.  Franken began by bringing up an interview Sessions gave in 2009, when he became the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions, Franken quoted, said at the time, \"We're not going to misrepresent any nominee's record and we're not going to lie about it.\" Franken then used the next 10 minutes of questioning to suggest that Sessions was actively misrepresenting his own record.  First, Sessions brought up another quote from that same interview in which Sessions claimed to have filed \"20 or 30 civil rights cases to desegregate schools\" other organizations as a US attorney in Alabama. But in November, Franken continued, Sessions' office said he had filed \"a number\" of desegregation cases. Which was it, Franken wanted to know. Sessions acknowledged that the record doesn't show that there were \"20 or 30\" and that \"the number would be less than that.\"  Next, Franken asked Sessions about a piece of his confirmation questionnaire that has come under scrutiny. On the questionnaire, Sessions named four civil rights cases among the 10 most significant cases he had \"personally\" litigated. But former Justice Department attorneys who oversaw three of those cases challenged Sessions' portrayal of his involvement, in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this month. They wrote:  We worked in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, which brought those lawsuits; we handled three of the four ourselves. We can state categorically that Sessions had no substantive involvement in any of them. He did what any U.S. attorney would have had to do: He signed his name on the complaint, and we added his name on any motions or briefs. Thats it.  Franken quoted extensively from this article and pressed Sessions on his involvement in the cases. Sessions defended himself by stating that he had cooperated with the Justice Department in bringing these civil rights cases and provided them with office space. He claimed this was more than other prosecutors had done at the time, more than 30 years agoa low bar for someone claiming to be a civil rights advocate.  The Justice Department \"is facing real challenges, whether it's protecting civil rights or defending national security, and our country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their level of involvement on any given issue,\" Franken concluded.

Now President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general, Sessions stands on the threshold of overseeing the country's criminal justice system and setting sentencing guidelines for prosecutors. The Alabama Republican will face questions about his views on criminal justice at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday.  During his campaign for Alabama attorney general in 1994, Sessions came out in support of a series of reforms to crack down on juvenile offenderseven nonviolent ones. According to a Birmingham News series at the time that was shared by the Democratic research firm American Bridge, Sessions proposed tough penalties \"that emphasize discipline and responsibility to deter non-violent first-time offenders from further crimes.\" Sessions also wanted to treat repeat juvenile offenders as adults and to use juvenile records when sentencing people for crimes they commit as adults. Further, Sessions hoped to move funding from the Department of Corrections to pay for more jail space and boot camps for juvenile offenders. He also suggested using work camps and recycling programs to \"make punishment meaningful.\"  Once elected attorney general, Sessions supported legislation in 1995 to crack down on juvenile offenders. Under the bill, according to the Birmingham News, children younger than 14 \"who commit crimes that would make them eligible for the death penalty if they were adults\" could be tried as adults in criminal court. Though they would not be eligible for the death penalty, they could be sentenced to life in prison and would serve no less than 20 years.  Sessions was also a fan of tough punishments, even those that were constitutionally questionable. In 1995, Alabama reinstituted chain gangs in its prisonsthe practice of shackling prisoners to one another and forcing them to perform hard labor. The custom had died out, but in 1995 Alabama Republican Gov. Fob James brought it back. Sessions, then state attorney general, was on board. \"I believe it's constitutional and proper,\" he said at the time. He also said he intended to \"aggressively defend any legal challenge against it.'' In December 1996, days before Sessions left for the US Senate, his office released a legal opinion declaring the chain gangs legal.  Though these proposals were made years ago, Sessions remains a hardliner when it comes to sentencing and criminal justice reform more broadly. Last year, Sessions successfully opposed bipartisan legislation to loosen mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes and reduce recidivism rates. Sessions was one of a handful of law-and-order Republicans who helped stall the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee despite the support of many Republicans. If Sessions is confirmed as attorney general, his departure from the Senate could help the bill pass this year. But Sessions will have significant power in his new role to set sentencing guidelines, in addition to overseeing police departments and prisons. Through so-called charging memos, the attorney general sets sentencing guidelines for prosecutors throughout the country. Sessions would also have a voice on the US Sentencing Commission, which develops sentencing guidelines for federal courts.  As the Marshall Project recently explained:", "date": "2017/01/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/alabama-jeff-sessions-held-views-criminal-justice-would-scare-reformers-today", "title": "In Alabama, Sessions Held Views on Criminal Justice Far Outside Today's Mainstream"}, {"text": "Alabama is nearly 30 percent black, but only three African American judges have ever sat on a federal bench there. Advocates for judicial diversity in the state say that in recent decades, that's thanks largely to Jeff Sessions, the Republican senator from Alabama whom Donald Trump has nominated to be his attorney general. During his 20 years in the Senate, they say, Sessions has used his perch on the judiciary committee to block nearly every black candidate for a judgeship in his state.  \"The senator has a problem putting African Americans on the federal bench in Alabama,\" says John Saxon, a Birmingham-based attorney who served on a committee in the 1990s that recommended nominees for judgeships in the state. \"And the people need to know that.\"  The Senate will hold confirmation hearings over Sessions' nomination for attorney general on Tuesday and Wednesday. If it votes to confirm him, Sessions will wield significant influence over issues of particular importance to African Americans and other minorities, such as the application of the nation's civil rights laws. Sessions has a troubled history on race relations that, along with his far-right views on immigration and other issues, has aroused strong opposition from civil rights leaders to his nomination. In 1986, the Senate failed to confirm Sessions, then a federal prosecutor, for a federal judgeship after witnesses at his confirmation hearing claimed Sessions had called a black colleague \"boy,\" labeled civil rights groups including the NAACP \"un-American,\" and joked that he used to like the Ku Klux Klan before he learned that its members smoked marijuana. Sessions has denied the first charge and said the other comments were taken out of context.  Those allegations have haunted his career, although he was elected Alabama attorney general in 1994 and to the US Senate two years later. But his track record on African American judges has received far less scrutiny.  For years, Democrats have tried to remedy the inequality in Alabama's court system by appointing more black judges. Nearly every time, Sessions has succeeded in stopping them.  \"It was definitely Jeff Sessions that was preventing the appointment of an African American,\" recalls state Sen. Hank Sanders of Mobile.  In 1996, Judge Alex Howard in the Southern District of Alabama retired, creating a vacancy on the same court where Sessions couldn't get confirmed 10 years prior. At the time, Saxon served on a federal appointments committee overseen by the state Democratic Party, and the committee quickly began vetting potential replacements. The Southern Districtwhose largest city, Sessions' hometown of Mobile, is majority African Americanhas never had a black judge, so the appointments committee unanimously decided that the position should go to an African American, several former members of the committee recall. The committee sent a list of several respected black lawyers and jurists in southern Alabama to the White House, but none of them was ever nominated for the position. According to Saxon, this is because Sessions had informed Bill Clinton's administration that he opposed every name on the list. Though Sessions had no constitutional power to block their nominations, senators are given significant sway over nominees in their states. And as a member of the judiciary committee, Sessions could have used procedural maneuvers to hold up their nominations indefinitely.  \"For four years, the entire second term of Bill Clinton's administration, that federal district judgeship sat empty, and the only reason it sat empty is Jeff Sessions blocked it,\" says Saxon. \"And in my opinion, the only reason he blocked it is because we made it clear from day one it's time to put an African American on the federal district bench in the only district in Alabama that hadn't had one.\"  Other members of the appointments committee, some of whom declined to speak on the record, agree that Sessions played a role in preventing the black judicial candidates from being nominated. The White House, they say, was not the problem: Several of them spoke to White House officials who were willing to nominate those black judges, as did other prominent Democrats in the state.  \"It was definitely Jeff Sessions that was preventing the appointment of an African American,\" recalls Democratic state Sen. Hank Sanders of Mobile, who remembers a White House official pointing to Sessions to explain why none of the black candidates were being put forward for confirmation.  \"Senator Sessions voted to confirm Eric Holder for Attorney General as well as judges like Abdul Kallon, Charles Wilson, Janice Rogers Brown, and Miguel Estrada and has put forward a number of women from his state as well,\" Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores says in an email response to questions about Sessions' record on black judges. \"As Senator, Jeff Sessions consistently voted for judges who would say what the law is and not what the law should be by substituting their own ideological preferences.\"  In the late 1990s, Saxon had the opportunity to appeal personally to Sessions about the vacant Southern District seat when he encountered the senator at a University of Alabama football game. As Saxon recalls, the two men huddled together in the university president's private box to discuss the open judicial seat, and Sessions repeatedly told Saxon that he couldn't live with any of the candidates the committee had suggested. So Saxon invited Sessions to propose a different black candidate for the position from anywhere in the state. There were several potential candidates who could have appealed to Sessions, Saxon says. One was Ken Simon, a black lawyer and former state judge who had served in the Ronald Reagan administration and worked at the state's largest corporate defense firm. \"He's not some flaming liberal,\" Saxon says. But Sessions didn't put forward Simon's name, or anyone else's.  \"I can't get in the man's heart or his soul,\" says Saxon. \"But I will tell you it's awfully curious that he blocked any of those names going forward and refused to come up with an alternative name with us saying, 'Jeff, it's time to desegregate the Southern District.'\"  Saxon's committee eventually decided that filling the Southern District vacancy with an African American was hopeless and put forward Donald Briskman, a respected Jewish lawyer in Mobile. Sessions blocked him, too, according to Saxon. In 2001, at Sessions' behest, President George W. Bush nominated Callie Granade, an assistant US attorney whom Sessions had mentored when he was the chief prosecutor in the district. She was confirmed with Sessions' support.  Sessions' opposition to black judges in Alabama doesn't seem to have dissipated over the years. President Barack Obama is leaving office with five district court seats in Alabama unfilled, and a vacancy reserved for an Alabama judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sits empty. Democrats tried to fill some of those open seats with African Americans, but years of conversations between the White House and Alabama's two Republican senators, Sessions and Richard Shelby, broke down, with the senators refusing to give approval to any of Obama's picks. \"I think the holdup is basically the White House is ready to nominate some individuals but would like to have some assurance from our senators...that they're going to at least give some positive thought toward the individuals the president nominates,\" Nancy Worley, the head of the Alabama Democratic Party, told the Montgomery Advertiser in 2015.  The only exception to this pattern was the confirmation of Abdul Kallon, a black lawyer, to a federal district judgeship in 2009. But because Kallon replaced retiring Judge U.W. Clemon, a Jimmy Carter appointee and the first African American federal judge in Alabama, the diversity of the state's bench didn't change. Clemon tells Mother Jones he believes Sessions' close ties to the corporate law firm where Kallon was a partner, Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, played a role in Sessions' decision to support his nomination. Bradley Arant has a lobbying presence in Washington, and two former Sessions aides have gone on to work at the firm. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Bradley Arant and its attorneys are the seventh-biggest donor to Sessions' political campaigns over the course of his Senate career.  \"I have always found that it is very easy to get white lawyers to be judges and it is very hard to get black lawyers to be judges,\" says Joe Reed, a longtime Democratic activist in Alabama.  Still, Sessions' support of Kallon only went so far. When Obama nominated Kallon to the vacant 11th Circuit seat in February 2016, Sessions opposed his confirmation. One-quarter of the residents of the 11th Circuit, which represents Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, are blackthe highest percentage of any federal appeals court in the countrybut only one of the court's 11 judges is African American. The seat on the court reserved for an Alabaman has never been held by a black judge.  The five open seats on Alabama's federal district courts will now be Trump's to fill. Liberals have criticized the Obama administration for failing to nominate more people of color in Alabama and other Southern states and for not fighting vigorously enough for the confirmation of the candidates he has nominated. But with Sessions on the judiciary committee, confirming black judges, particularly in Alabama, might have been an uphill battle.  \"I have always found that it is very easy to get white lawyers to be judges, and it is very hard to get black lawyers to be judges,\" says Joe Reed, a longtime Democratic activist in Alabama who served with Saxon on the appointments committee.  During Obama's second term, Reed and Sanders, the state senator, traveled to Washington to meet with Sessions, Shelby, and Rep. Terri Sewell, the only Democrat in Alabama's congressional delegation, with the goal of confirming multiple judgesincluding African American onesin Alabama and on the 11th Circuit. Reed appealed to the senators by invoking their place in history. \"You've got a legacy,\" he recalls telling them. \"I don't know anybody who's ever come out great, or been considered great or good, unless they came down on the side of justice, on the side of civil rights, on the side of racial harmony and progress. I don't know anybody who's ever been on the other side and looked good.\" The senators responded, he says, by telling him they wanted fair judges.  After the meeting, Reed and Sanders hung back and spoke with Sessions alone. \"The meeting was over, and Dr. Reed said, 'Hank, let's try to talk to Sessions,'\" Sanders says, in an account confirmed by Reed. \"'Cause we considered Sessions a problem. We didn't consider Shelby the same problem.\" But this second attempt also fell apart when Sessions brought up the fact that Sanders had testified against his confirmation to a federal judgeship in 1986.  \"Thirty years later, that was still something he was holding in his craw,\" Sanders says. \"My interpretation of the message was, 'You're not going to get anything out of me. You all stopped me from being a federal judge, and you're not going to get anything out of me.'\"  This story has been updated to include comment from Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores.", "date": "2017/01/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/jeff-sessions-blocked-black-judges-alabama", "title": "Jeff Sessions Has a History of Blocking Black Judges"}, {"text": "When Donald Trump's victory on election night became clear, the shares of the largest private prison corporations shot up. If the Senate confirms Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as the next attorney general in the coming weeks, the companies and their shareholders will have even more to celebrate.  Last summer, the Justice Department announced it would stop contracting with the for-profit prison industry, whose facilities are more violent and less humane than government-run prisons. But Trump has spoken favorably of private prisons, and Sessions, who at the helm of the Justice Department would have the power to reverse its decision, has close ties to the industry and a history of supporting private prisons.  The horrors of private prisons are well documented. In August, a report from the Justice Department inspector general found dramatically higher levels of violence between inmates and between inmates and staff at private prisons that contracted with the Bureau of Prisons than at comparable public facilities. The inspector general also found more instances of lockdowns and unjustified use of isolation units and solitary confinement. The report, which corroborated years of evidence of mismanagement at private prisonsincluding a Mother Jones investigation of a Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) prison in Louisianaprompted the Obama administration's decision to phase out its contracts with private prisons.  The incoming Trump administration will likely be a boon to the flailing for-profit prison industry. \"I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons,\" Trump said last spring. \"It seems to work a lot better.\" Trump campaigned on a promise to deport undocumented immigrants, a policy also championed by Sessions that will require more detention facilities for people facing deportation proceedings. \"I think we're looking ahead at massive expansion of our detention system,\" Mary Small of the Detention Watch Network, which opposes private prisons, told NPR this week. \"And what we've seen over the last decade is that when the detention system grows, that's mainly through the use of private prison companies.\"  The GEO Group, one of the largest private prison companies, came under fire this fall after one of its subsidiaries donated $125,000 to a pro-Trump super-PAC. A watchdog group argued the donation was illegal because government contractors are barred from making political contributions and the subsidiary is indistinguishable from GEO Group.  Sessions has repeatedly expressed support for private prisons over the past 20 years. As attorney general of Alabama, Sessions greenlighted the use of private prisons in his own state. In early 1996, Sessions wrote an advisory opinion stating that state law allowed Alabama to contract with private companies to manage state prisons, according to the Birmingham News. (The privatization push was led by State Prison Commissioner Ron Jones, who was forced to resign a few months later for trying to turn the female prison population into a shackled chain gang.)  In 2006, Sessions helped a private prison in Perry County, Alabama, secure a lucrative federal contract to house undocumented immigrants awaiting court proceedings or deportation, according to the Birmingham News. The prison had been empty because state lawmakers had balked at the cost of housing inmates at the private facility.  In the US Senate, Sessions has expressed support for private prisons. At a Senate Judiciary Hearing in 2010, Sessions expressed his backing of the for-profit prison industry during a confirmation hearing for a nominee to lead the US Marshals Service. \"I did want to say that I do think there is a role for private prisons in the American system,\" Sessions told the nominee, Stacia Hylton, whose ties to the private prison industry had received scrutiny from Democrats. \"I do not think you would have a blanket refusal to consider that and if anybody is critical of you for that, I do not think that would be justified.\"  This fall, in the wake of the Justice Department's decision to move away from private prison contracting, the GEO Group hired several lobbyists, including two former aides to Sessions. Alabama attorneys David Stewart and Ryan Robichaux were hired to lobby on \"federal government use of contract correctional facilities,\" according to Politico. They'll know exactly who to turn to if their former boss becomes attorney general.", "date": "2017/01/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/jeff-sessions-trump-private-prisons-attorney-general", "title": "Attorney General Sessions Would Be Good News for Private Prisons"}, {"text": "During his campaign, President Donald Trump pledged his commitment to the anti-abortion movement and promised he would only appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal. He also promised to permanently defund Planned Parenthood and enshrine into law a ban on public funding for abortion and one prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks. The person most qualified to meet the first challenge is apparently Neil Gorsuch, a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, whom Trump nominated last month to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's spot on the bench. Gorsuch's confirmation hearings begin on March 20.  The announcement was greeted with cheers by the pro-life community. \"[Trump] has proved himself to be a man of his word,\" wrote Operation Rescue's President Troy Newman, who has argued that the US government has the responsibility to execute \"convicted murderers, including abortionists.\" Said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the conservative and pro-life women's group the Susan B. Anthony List, \"Should pro-abortion Democratic Senators choose to filibuster this immensely qualified nominee, they do so at their own political peril.\"  Overturning Roe will take much more than the confirmation of a single justice, but Gorsuch's record as a judge gives reproductive rights advocates some evidence of his legal approach to some of these issues. Appointed to the circuit court by President George W. Bush in 2006, he wrote the dissenting opinion in a decision blocking Utah's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood in October. As a federal appellate court judge, he also ruled for Hobby Lobby and against the Obamacare rule that requires companies to include contraception coverage in their health insurance plans. \"I think it's fair to say he's a leader in terms of conservative jurisprudence,\" Tom Fitton, the president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, told Newsweek. \"And I think he quickly would become a strong voice on the court for his constitutional approach to decision making.\"  Cases can take years to even make it to the Supreme Court, and the Justices decide to hear only a fraction of those that do. This is one reason why Roe will not be overturned immediately no matter who is on the court. But the conservative wave in Congress and state legislatures have ensured that there will be no shortage of proposals to curtail women's health and, by extension, no dearth of court cases making their way toward the high court.  Here are some of them:  Planned Parenthood Defunding  About half of Planned Parenthood's funding, or $553.7 million, comes from federal, state, and local governments, and 75 percent of that comes from Medicaid. Over the last few yearsin part because of a series of surreptitious videos made about the organizationmore than a dozen states have enacted laws to remove funding for the nation's single-largest women's health care organization by cutting Medicaid dollars and Title X family-planning grants. Under the Hyde Amendment, a federal budget rider for the last 40 years, Planned Parenthood is already prohibited from using any federal funds to pay for abortions, which account for only 3 percent of the organization's health services, the bulk of which are contraception, Pap smears, STD screenings, and menopausal care.  Courts in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and elsewhere have blocked attempts to cut Planned Parenthood's Medicaid dollars, ruling that low-income people should be able to access health care from the provider of their choiceand some of those cases are ongoing. In February, the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, pledged to appeal a federal court's decision to block the state's funding ban. And whether or not states can withhold Title X money from Planned Parenthood remains an open question. Because of this, says Donna Crane, vice president of policy at NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood funding is ripe for a high-profile legal battle.  And Congress is gearing up to make that happen: This year, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced two bills that would block Title X and Medicaid money from going to Planned Parenthood. In the past, similar bills have either died on the floor or been vetoed, but Trump has promised to sign the legislation. At a House committee hearing last month, Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) called the Title X funding ban \"the most serious threat women have faced so far this Congress.\"  Pre-Viability Abortion Bans  In Roe, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to abortion is protected up until the point of fetal viability, usually defined as 24 weeks gestation. But since 2010, 19 states have passed laws banning abortion at 20 weeks, arguing that at this point the fetus can feel pain. Only 3 of the 19 statutes have been blocked by lawsuits. In Arizona, a challenge to a 20-week law made it up to the Supreme Court in 2014, but the high court decided not to hear the case, leaving in place a 9th Circuit Court decision to block the law.  At the federal level, Congress has for years tried and failed to pass a 20-week ban. Trump, however, has promised to sign a 20-week ban if it gets to his desk. And his message of approval combined with Republican domination of governor's mansions and statehouses have inspired the introduction of 20-week ban legislation in at least four more states: Pennsylvania, Iowa, Kentucky, and Virginia. Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a similar measure in December.  Both abortion-rights foes and advocates have acknowledged that pre-viability prohibitions such as these pose a strategic threat to Roe by challenging its very framework. \"I do think [20-week bans] would present very dynamic challenges for the Supreme Court,\" John Seago, the legislative director of Texas Right to Life, told NBC News. \"They would make [the justices] reanalyze the premise to uphold elective abortion as a legal right.\" Mike Gonidakis, the president of Right to Life in Ohio, which enacted a 20-week ban this year, called them a \"winnable battle with the federal judiciary.\"  The challenge for the pro-life movement will be finding a moment and a federal courtOhio's 10th Circuit, for instancethat will uphold a 20-week ban, in which case the differing decisions between the 9th and the 10th circuits would make consideration of the issue by the high court more likely.  Contraception Coverage  The Supreme Court has already heard two cases related to the Obamacare requirement that certain employers offer insurance plans that cover contraceptivesonce in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby and a second time in Zubik v. Burwell. Both cases were brought by businesses whose leadership argued the contraceptive mandate conflicted with their religious beliefs. Zubik v. Burwell was a consolidation of seven different cases from a number of different circuit courts. Last May, the Supreme Court sent it back to lower courts and asked the Obama administration to come up with a compromise. Eleven days before the end of his term, the Obama administration announced that the solution suggested by the high court in its remand was impossible.  It's unclear exactly what will happen with the Zubik cases. Based on the Obama administration's response, they may not be settled in the lower courts and are likely to return to the Supreme Court for further review. If that happens, Gorsuch's ruling from the 10th Circuit in Hobby Lobby offers a sense of where he stands on the issue. There are at least 10 other lawsuits related to the contraceptive mandate that are also now in federal appeals courts.  There's also the possibility that Health and Human Services head Tom Price could lead the efforts to change part or all of the contraception rule by either expanding the religious exemptions in the law to satisfy companies such as Hobby Lobby or getting rid of the requirement altogether. In those scenarios, the plaintiffs fighting the rule might drop their cases.  Recent Supreme Court decisions may have given abortion advocates cause for optimism about the preservation of abortion rights by the nation's highest court. \"We have the wind at our backs,\" said Zoe Levine, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, the group that successfully defended a Texas clinic against two anti-abortion laws before the Supreme Court last year. \"We feel strongly that the abortion right is entrenched in the Constitution.\" That may all change should Trump be given the opportunity to nominate a justice after Gorsuch.", "date": "2017/03/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/gorsuch-supreme-court-roe-wade-abortion", "title": "Here's How the War on Women Could Land in the Supreme Court"}, {"text": "The Unites States Marine Corps is scrambling to address the fallout from revelations over the weekend of a Facebook group where hundreds of nude photos of female service members, veterans, and civilians were posted without their consent by other Marines. Military officials are reportedly investigating the matter, which has reignited discussions over the treatment of women in the military. The photo scandal comes two months after three female Marines became the first women to join the infantry.  The secret \"Marines United\" Facebook group was first uncovered by The War Horse, a nonprofit news organization run by investigative journalist and military veteran Thomas Brennan. In an article published Saturday by the Center for Investigative Reporting's Reveal News, Brennan noted that since the end of January, photos of more than two dozen womenmany on active dutywith their names, location, and military rank were shared on the page. In at least one incident, comments on a photo advocated for a woman to be sexually assaulted.  The scandal \"underscores ongoing problems of sexual harassment within military ranks and could hurt recruitment of women,\" Brennan writes. \"Officials within the Defense Department confirmed it also puts service members at risk for blackmail and jeopardizes national security.\"  Photos posted in the group, which has more than 30,000 members, many using their personal Facebook accounts, reportedly drew plenty of attention, inspiring more than 2,500 comments. According to Brennan, some members of the Facebook group \"invited others to collect, identify and share photos of naked or scantily clad service women.\" Many group members also had access to a Google Drive that included dossiers with women's names and social media information, as well as photos of unidentified women in various states of undress. The total number of photos shared in the \"Marines United\" group and through Google Drive is unknown.  The photos have come from a variety of sources. Two women, who had their photos shared online, said that they believe former partners leaked the images. Others said that they fear their accounts may have been hacked and their personal photos stolen. Another woman learned that she had been stalked by a fellow Marine only after Brennan contacted military officials for comment.  Shortly after Brennan requested comment, social media accounts behind the photo sharing were removed by Facebook and Google at the military's request. A formal investigation has been launched by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. At least one Marine has already been discharged for photographing a female corporal without her consent.  An internal document recently circulated to military public affairs officers notes that any Marines found to have posted explicit photos without a woman's consent could face charges under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice. Others who shared the photos could face criminal charges or administrative action.  \"No person should be treated this way. It is inconsistent with our Core Values, and it impedes our ability to perform our mission,\" said Sgt. Major Ronald L. Green, the Marines' highest ranking enlisted service member, in a statement to CBS News. According to the Associated Press, the Defense Department has launched its own review into the incident.  The controversy follows a 2015 announcement by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter ending the ban on women in military combat roles. The scandal also arises as the military struggles to deal with sexual assaults in its ranks. There were roughly 6,000 reports of military sexual assault in 2015, the most recent year for which numbers are available, according to the Pentagon. Advocates argue that fear of reprisal has deterred many victims from reporting assaults, leaving the exact number unclear.", "date": "2017/03/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/marines-secret-facebook-group-sharing-explicit-photos-women", "title": "A Secret Marines Facebook Group Shared Nude Photos of Female Service Members"}, {"text": "There are several grounds for divorce in Mississippi, including impotency, adultery, and even \"habitual drunkenness.\" But domestic violence is not one of them, and it wont be anytime soon, after recent legislative efforts to add spousal abuse to Mississippi divorce law failed in a state House committee on Tuesday.  Battered spouses in Mississippi often argue that they have suffered \"habitual cruel and inhuman treatment,\" which qualify as grounds for divorce under state law. Domestic violence advocacy groups in the state say that the \"habitual\" standard requires a high burden of proof of recurring violence. But many cases of abuse, which often occur in private, are unable to meet this standard unless there is photographic evidence or a witness. Advocates also argue that the current law does not sufficiently cover spouses dealing with emotional or financial abuse.  In order to address these problems, Republican state Sen. Sally Doty introduced a bill earlier this year that would add domestic violence to the 12 grounds for divorce available in the state. The bill passed the Mississippi Senate by an overwhelming margin and seemed poised for an easy victory in the House. But when the bill arrived in Mississippi's House Judiciary Committee, Chairman Andy Gipson, a Republican, quickly objected.  Gipson argued that the measure did not clearly define what constituted domestic spousal abuse and suggested the addition would lead to a sharp uptick in divorces in the state. \"To me the way it's worded could possibly be interpreted that if someone raised their voice at their spouse, is that domestic assault?\" he asked, according to the Clarion-Ledger. \"If that's the case, then a lot of people would have a ground for divorce in Mississippi.\"  According to local news outlet Mississippi Today, Gipson, who is also a Baptist pastor, said that at a time when \"we need to be adopting policies that promote marriage and people sticking together, I have some serious concerns about opening the floodgates any more than they already are. I think the floodgates are already open and this just tears the dam down.\"  Mississippi state law prefers that both parties agree to end a marriage, allowing couples with a mutual desire for a divorce to cite \"irreconcilable differences\" and move forward in the process. But when one party refuses to accept the divorce, things can become complicated. In those cases, the person seeking to end the marriage must reach an agreement with his or her spouse on the terms of the divorce or claim one of the grounds provided under state law. The final decision to grant the divorce is left to the courts.  This is the second time in two years that an effort to add domestic violence to Mississippi's divorce laws has failed. Last year, a similar measure, also introduced by Doty, died in the state Senate after other new grounds for divorce were added to the bill.  Gipson has declined to consider at least one other divorce law proposed this year: He refused to advance a bill adding extended separation to the grounds for divorce. His actions suggest that few divorce proposals would ever win his support. \"If there's a case of abuse, that person needs to have [a] change of behavior and a serious change of heart,\" Gipson said yesterday. \"Hopefully even in those cases restoration can happen.\"  Update, 8:52 p.m. EST: In a statement posted to Facebook, Gipson defended his decision to scuttle the domestic abuse bill, citing the \"cruel and inhuman treatment\" standard as sufficient protection for abused spouses. \"The law already provides a clear way out of a marriage for victims of domestic abuse, without the need for another bill,\" he wrote. \"To deny this reality is to ignore the current state of Mississippi law.\"", "date": "2017/03/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/mississippi-domestic-violence-divorce-bill-fails", "title": "Mississippi Still Won\u0089\u00db\u00aat Make Domestic Abuse Grounds for Divorce"}, {"text": "Trump kicks off Black History Month with housing and urban development secretary nominee Ben Carson on February 1.  When Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the White House would host a series of events celebrating Black History Month, many African Americans were skeptical that it would be a genuine effort. President Donald Trump, who was once sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against black tenants, launched his foray into politics by questioning the citizenship of the nation's first black president. His black outreach efforts during the campaign often veered into offensive territory, with frequent references to \"inner cities\" as crime-ridden hellscapes, and only 8 percent of black voters cast ballots for him. He appointed Steve Bannon, who led a right-wing website with white nationalist ties, as chief strategist and Jeff Sessions, who has faced allegations of racism for decades, as attorney general.  Those concerns were quickly borne out. From the first day of Black History Month, Trump repeatedly bungled attempts to commemorate the country's African American leaders and community. Here's a recap of the Trump administration's first Black History Month:  2/1: Trump's disastrous Black History Month kickoff  Trump began his speech at the White House's Black History Month kickoff event as follows:  Well, the election, it came out really well. Next time we'll triple the number [of black votes] or quadruple it. We want to get it over 51, right? At least 51.  It didn't get better from there. Trump paused briefly to reflect on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. but then used the civil rights icon to get in a few jabs at the \"fake news\" reporters who mistakenly said that Trump removed a bust of King from the Oval Office shortly after the presidential inauguration. \"So I think it was a disgrace, but that's the way the press is,\" Trump said. \"Very unfortunate.\"  Then Trump referred to 19th-century black abolitionist Frederick Douglass in the present tense, leaving many to wonder if Trump actually knew who Douglass was. \"Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,\" the president said.  Spicer struggled to clarify Trump's comments later that afternoon. \"I think there's contributionsI think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made,\" Spicer said. \"And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that [Trump's] going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.\"  2/1: Senate committee approves Sessions  Trump's pick for attorney general took a big step toward confirmation when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to move the Alabama Republican's nomination to the Senate floor. The move drew condemnation from civil rights groups with deep concerns about putting the agency in charge of enforcing civil rights laws in the hands of a man with a troubled racial history.  Black lawmakers were also not happy that Sessionswhose 1986 bid for a federal judgeship was derailed by allegations that he had made racially insensitive comments to an African American deputywas on the path to confirmation as attorney general.  2/2: #PenceBlackHistory  Vice President Mike Pence celebrated the second day of Black History Month by tweeting about Abraham Lincoln:  As #BlackHistoryMonth begins, we remember when Pres. Lincoln submitted the 13th Amendment, ending slavery, to the states #NationalFreedomDay  Vice President Pence (@VP) February 2, 2017  Pence's recognition of a white man to commemorate Black History Month did not go over well, sparking the #PenceBlackHistory hashtag on Twitter.  2/8: Spicer says Coretta Scott King would have changed her mind about Sessions  Senate Republicans blocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) from reading a 1986 letter written by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow, opposing Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship. In the letter, King noted that while serving as a US attorney in Alabama, Sessions had \"used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.\"  The next day, Spicer said he \"respectfully disagreed\" with King's assessment. \"I can only hope that if she was still with us today, that after getting to know him and to see his record and his commitment to voting civil rights, that she would share the same view that Sen. [Arlen] Specter did where he said, 'Although I voted against him, getting to know the man that is now, I regret that vote,'\" Spicer said.  Sessions was officially confirmed as attorney general later that day.  2/12: The Department of Education's 'W.E.B. DeBois' tweet  The Department of Education also tried its hand at celebrating Black History Month, only to misspell the name of famed black intellectual and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois.  Education must not simply teach work - it must teach life.  W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA  US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017  After heavy criticism, the Education Department corrected the tweet and issued an apology. Unfortunately, it misspelled part of its apology tweet, too.  2/16: Trump asks a black reporter to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus  During a Trump press conference described as \"surreal\" and \"an exhausting 77-minute extravaganza,\" American Urban Radio Networks Washington bureau chief April Ryan asked the president if he would take a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss his plan for inner cities. After first expressing confusion over Ryan's use of the CBC acronym, Trumpwho had called himself \"the least racist person\" earlier in the press conferencewent on the offensive.  \"Well, I would,\" Trump told Ryan, who is African American. \"Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Set up the meeting!\"  The Congressional Black Caucus then pointed out that it had been asking for a meeting since January:  Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We're the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad! Letter: https://t.co/58KiuHmITF  The CBC (@OfficialCBC) February 16, 2017  The White House is reportedly working to get something scheduled.  2/21: Trump visits the National Museum of African American History and Culture  Trump was \"visibly moved\" by the Smithsonian's newest museum. At one point, while looking at a slave auction block, Trump reportedly paused to say, \"Boy, that is just not good.\"  After the tour, Trump said his museum visit was \"a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance, and hatred in all of its very ugly forms\"nearly a month after signing an executive order temporarily barring refugees and residents of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the country.  2/23: Trump addresses those urban hellscapes  Trump frequently points to the uptick in violence in Chicago as evidence of the rising violence in the \"inner cities\" that he regularly (and misleadingly) spoke of on the campaign trail. Trump has called the violence \"very easily fixable,\" saying that the part of the fault lies with local officials who are \"overly politically correct.\" After seven people in Chicago were fatally shot in a single day, Trump tweeted:  Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there - totally out of control. Chicago needs help!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017  He repeated those sentiments in a speech the next day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, adding, \"We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\" The remarks did not sit well with Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who said that city officials have asked for federal help and gotten no response. \"We've made requests to the White House and the Justice Department for them to support our work,\" Johnson said in a statement. He added that Mayor Rahm Emanuel had made an in-person request of the administration earlier this month. \"We are hopeful the administration will finally respond,\" Johnson said.  2/25: Trump promises to support the black communitybut stays light on the details  Trump often refers to his \"New Deal for Black America\" proposal that he introduced during the campaign. In his last weekly address of the month, the president turned to that proposal again, promising to help African Americans. \"I want every African American child, family, and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities, and good-paying jobs,\" he said.  But Trump has provided few details on how he'll help black Americans. When discussing historically black colleges and universities during the address, Trump promised to \"promote\" their accomplishments more, saying that \"they are not given the credit that they deserve, and they are going to start getting that credit.\" For weeks, Trump has promised a new executive order supporting historically black colleges and universities, but the administration has yet to release it or explain how it will differ from the support offered by prior administrations.  There's still a chance for Trump. Some black college and university presidents say they are willing to work with the administration on initiatives such as increasing student grant accessibility. On Monday, the president briefly met with HBCU leaders in the Oval Office. His executive order could arrive as early as Tuesday. If Trump issues something substantive, his Black History Month may end better than it started.  2/27: Betsy DeVos honors HBCUs for pioneering school choice, misunderstands why they were created  So much for that. Hours after the meeting with HBCU leaders ended, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement that \"HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice\" and that \"their success has shown that more options help students flourish.\"  The Trump administration has strongly supported expanding school choicemeaning alternatives to traditional public schoolssaying that the programs will help black students. But framing black colleges as part of the school choice movement misses a key point: Historically black colleges and universities flourished because segregation had barred most black students from attending white institutions. As the Education Departments own website explains, during the segregation era, HBCUs were \"the principle means for providing postsecondary education to black Americans.\"  2/28: Sessions promises to protect civil rights, but moves policy in the opposite direction  During a brief address at a Black History Month film screening hosted by the Justice Department, Sessions promised that the agency will continue to protect civil rights. \"We will work to safeguard justice through law for all of our citizens,\" he said. \"...This is a key part of our mission.\" But the previous evening, the Justice Department had reversed its position on a key voter ID case in Texas. Under President Barack Obama, the department had argued that the state's voter ID lawone of the toughest in the nationintentionally discriminated against minorities. But Sessions, who believes there is widespread voter fraud despite minimal evidence of it, evidently disagrees. His deputy asked a federal court to dismiss the Justice Department's earlier arguments against the law.

In previous years, the law had been reauthorized without difficulty, but this time was different, sparking a year of debates in Congress over a set of additional protections introduced by Democrats. Still, when the measure returned to the Senate for a final vote, the result was overwhelming: 78 senators voted in favor, and just 22 were opposed. In the latter camp was Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who had told CNN, \"Fundamentally, you can't vote [for] a piece of legislation you don't think is sound.\"  Four years later, Sessions has been confirmed as attorney general, putting him in charge of carrying out the same version of the Violence Against Women Act that he opposed. That has advocates for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking worried that Sessions could oversee a shift in enforcement that will leave victims vulnerable.  During his time in the Senate, Sessions voted twicefirst in 2000 and again in 2005in favor of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA. Both reauthorizations passed unanimously. But when the law came up for review in 2012, it contained several significant additions: an increase in the number of visas available to battered immigrant women fleeing their abusers, new nondiscrimination protections for LGBT survivors of violence, and a provision granting tribal courts the authority to prosecute non-Native Americans who abused Native women on tribal land.  Senate Republicans argued that the new provisions were too broad and would invite abuse of VAWA funding. Sessions accused Democrats of including them to turn the reauthorization into a political battle. \"There are matters put on that bill that almost seem to invite opposition,\" he told the New York Times in 2012. \"You think that's possible? You think they might have put things in there we couldn't support that maybe then they could accuse you of not being supportive of fighting violence against women?\"  Sessions' opposition to the expanded VAWA has some advocates worried that his Justice Department will not prioritize protections for victimsparticularly victims who belong to marginalized groups, given Sessions' longstanding hardline conservative views on immigration, LGBT equality, and civil rights issues.  \"When you think about what a [Department of Justice] should be, the role that a DOJ can play, and juxtapose that with the record that Sen. Sessions has had historically with regards to civil rights, with regards to women's rights, it is clear to us that he should not [have been] confirmed to a position that is as crucial as this position is,\" says Fatima Goss Graves, a senior vice president at the National Women's Law Center, which examines how policies affect women.  Sessions' record offers little reassurance that he would work actively to help marginalized communities. He has voted against other measures that aim to protect some of the same groups covered by VAWA. LGBT groups are especially concerned, noting that Sessions supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and ardently opposed a 2009 hate crimes bill that expanded protections for LGBT people and rape victims. One day after Sessions assumed office, the Justice Department withdrew its legal defense of an Obama-era directive protecting transgender children in schools.  \"The Violence Against Women Act is currently the only law that includes explicit protections around sexual orientation and gender identity,\" says Emily Waters, senior manager of national research and policy for the New York Anti-Violence Project, which provides services for LGBT victims of violence. \"Without an attorney general who is willing to put resources behind that, a lot of the nondiscrimination protections lose a lot of their impact.\"  Sessions' previous opposition to increasing VAWA protections for immigrant women suggests he's unlikely to consider domestic violence when helping implement Trump's recent executive order calling for increased deportations. Earlier this month in El Paso, Texas, a transgender victim of domestic abuse appeared in court to seek a restraining order against her assailant. While in the courtroom, she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after it was revealed that she was undocumented. Early reports suggested that her abuser tipped authorities off to her immigration status.  \"If you care about violence against LGBTQ people, against communities of color, against immigrant communities, [you] should really, really be paying attention to Jeff Sessions.\"  Stories like this suggest that undocumented victims might be less protected under a Sessions Justice Department that is likely to crack down on undocumented immigrants. \"What we know from experience is that when an immigrant community knows that local law enforcement is regularly collaborating with ICE, victims are not going to come forward,\" says Grace Huang, policy director of the Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence and a member of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. \"They are going to stay in the shadows. And that harms all of us.\"  She adds, \"We're probably going to have to change our advice to survivors on how to stay safe.\"  Last October, Sessions was asked about the controversial 2005 Access Hollywood video that showed Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals without their consent. \"I don't characterize that as sexual assault,\" he told the Weekly Standard. \"I think that's a stretch.\" He later said his comments were mischaracterized. During his confirmation hearing last month, Sessions said that if a woman were grabbed without her consent, \"clearly it would be\" sexual assault.  Lisalyn Jacobs, a former Justice Department staffer during the Clinton administration, says the incident illustrates not only Sessions' poor understanding of assault but also his willingness to defend Trump in any situation. \"[Sessions] may have been hired by Donald Trump to do that job, but Donald Trump is not his client,\" says Jacobs, who is also a member of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.  Sessions has been silent on his plans for the Justice Department's Office on Violence Against Women, which is responsible for enforcing VAWA and funding services for victims. But a blueprint from the Heritage Foundationa powerful conservative group with close ties to the Trump teamcalls for eliminating all Violence Against Women grants. The blueprint was widely circulated last month and is reportedly being used as a guide for the administration, reinforcing advocates' concerns about the future of many VAWA programs.  \"If you care about violence against LGBTQ people, against communities of color, against immigrant communities, [you] should really, really be paying attention to Jeff Sessions,\" says Waters. \"We really have to continue to watch him and never pretend that he is going to be an advocate for marginalized communities.\"", "date": "2017/02/22", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sessions-justice-department-violence-against-women-act-enforcement", "title": "Jeff Sessions Is in Charge of Enforcing the Violence Against Women Act, and Victims' Advocates Are Worried"}, {"text": "When Carina Guzman arrived in Troutdale, Oregon, almost nine years ago as an undocumented teenager from Colombia, she wasn't prepared to navigate the vast range of services available in the state. She knew that she wanted contraception, but her inexperience with Oregon's health care system and inability to obtain insurance due to her citizenship status left Guzman confused about her available options. \"When it came to choosing to access reproductive health care services, I was pretty much on my own,\" she says.  Guzman eventually found out that she could purchase birth control, but without any insurance, a 12-month supply would set her back hundreds of dollars. A friend told her she could go to Planned Parenthood andthanks to Oregon's involvement in the federal Title X family-planning programget a year's worth of birth control free of charge.  Now in her early 20s, Guzman's circumstances have changed considerably. A few years ago she was able to secure documentation of her immigration status, she found a job after graduating from high school, and she now has health insurance through her employer. She points to Planned Parenthood and the contraceptive security it provided as one of the reasons for her success. Without the organization, she says, it \"would have been five years of me not accessing anything.\"  But in the near future, with a wave of anti-abortion legislation emerging from conservative statehouses across the country, the fate of the Affordable Care Act in question, and Planned Parenthood's federal funding in jeopardy, women in many states may soon not have Guzman's options.  As Congress and several GOP-controlled states ramp up efforts to curb access to abortion and roll back reproductive health care, Oregon may be moving in the opposite direction. Last week, a coalition of activists and community advocates announced the launch of a new promotional campaign in support of the Reproductive Health Equity Act of 2017, a bill that would make the state the first in the nation to establish reproductive health equity by protecting no-cost birth control and extending full coverage of reproductive health services to immigrant women, transgender and gender-nonconforming people, and the uninsured. The legislation is the brainchild of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Oregon, a collective of local reproductive rights advocates, community organizations, and racial and gender justice groups. The measure was filed by two Democrats, state Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson and state Rep. Jeff Barker, ahead of the upcoming legislative session and will be officially introduced in the beginning of February when the Oregon Legislature reconvenes.  Oregon is one of 28 states that currently mandate contraceptive coverage, meaning that coverage would still exist even if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. But some older insurance plans \"grandfathered\" in when the state first set up its health care exchange do not cover the full cost of contraception, forcing some women in the state to share the cost.  The Oregonian notes that the bill would \"require health insurers to cover other reproductive health services, including well-woman care, prenatal care, breastfeeding support and testing for sexually transmitted infections,\" in addition to providing for post-partum care and covering screenings for cervical cancer, breast cancer, and gestational diabetes. The legislation would also add abortion to the list of reproductive health services that commercial insurance plans on the state's Affordable Care Act Exchange must cover with no additional costa change that would set Oregon apart from the 25 states that restrict plans on state exchanges from covering abortion. It does offer religious employers an exemption, allowing them to opt-out of providing insurance plans covering contraception and abortion.  Groups that face significant barriers to accessing affordable health care and are often prevented from accessing insurance that covers their needs, such as immigrant women and transgender and gender-nonconforming communities, also stand to gain if the legislation is passed. While Oregon has moved to eliminate barriers facing undocumented immigrants, some 48,000 women of reproductive age in Oregon are unable to access insurance because of their citizenship status, and insurance coverage often relies on one's gender-marker, limiting the ability of transgender men to access reproductive care. Advocates note that the bill contains provisions that will aid both groups, adding that the measure would be one of the first in the country to bar discrimination in reproductive health care coverage.  \"The Reproductive Health Equity Act...would ensure that all Oregonians, regardless of income, citizenship status, gender identity, or the type of insurance that they have, have the freedom to decide if and when they have children.\"  \"The Reproductive Health Equity Act is legislation that would ensure that all Oregonians, regardless of income, citizenship status, gender identity, or the type of insurance that they have, have the freedom to decide if and when they have children,\" says Laurel Swerdlow, the advocacy director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, one of the groups on the Pro-Choice Coalition's steering committee.  The Oregon Legislature has a democratic majority, possibly curbing strong conservative opposition to the measure. But previous efforts to pass proactive reproductive health care legislation in Oregon have run into difficulty. In 2015, the Comprehensive Women's Health Bill, a measure that would have required insurance companies to cover a range of reproductive health services at a low cost, was proposed. The bill had a strong start in the Legislature but was killed by Democrats out of fear that a provision covering abortions would be too controversial.  This time, advocates hope that the Reproductive Health Equity Act won't suffer the same fatedespite the bill containing a similar provision covering abortionsarguing that the national climate around reproductive rights, when coupled with the legislation's nondiscrimination protections, make a compelling case. \"Oregonians and their legislators now understand in personal terms and in public health benefits that the full spectrum of reproductive health services needs to not only be safe and legal, but affordable and accessible,\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon Executive Director Mary Nolan said in a statement.  The Oregon measure was being worked on well before the election, but supporters of the legislation say Donald Trump's surprising victory has added new urgency to the need for the laws. Monnes Anderson says fears of an Affordable Care Act repeal are a motivating factor, telling the Oregonian, \"We want to get ahead of what may happen at the federal level.\"  Recent actions on Capitol Hill support their concerns. During a vote earlier this month, Senate Republicans rejected an Affordable Care Act amendment that requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of contraceptives, a move that could leave millions of women without no-cost birth control if Republicans succeed in dismantling the ACA.  Proactive reproductive health legislation may become more common in liberal states eager to mitigate the effects of an ACA repeal. The New York state assembly recently passed two measures, the Reproductive Health Act and the Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act, that would protect abortion and contraceptive access if the ACA is dismantled. On Saturday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that health insurers in the state would be required to cover most forms of contraception and medically necessary abortions at no cost. A Democratic legislator in Illinois is considering introducing a bill that would expand abortion coverage for women on Medicaid and some forms of state insurance. In Virginia, Democrats have introduced several bills to counteract attacks on reproductive health; one of themthe Birth Control Access Actwould allow women to obtain an entire year of birth control at one time.  Oregon has had a long history of supporting reproductive rights with policy initiatives. In 1969, the state became one of the first to legalize abortion, and it does not have any laws restricting the procedure. Last year, Oregon became the first state to enact a law allowing women to get a birth control prescription without needing to visit a doctor. That law and the Affordable Care Act's birth control mandate have helped expand contraceptive use in the state, contributing to a 15 percent drop in abortions between 2011 and 2014. Last week, the Guttmacher Institute released a survey that found the national abortion rate has hit the lowest point since the the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade, noting that increased contraceptive use has likely played a large role in the decline.  Advocates hope the insurance mandates will protect that progress, but they also argue that the state should go further when it comes to supporting the reproductive health of underserved communities, adding that during the Trump administration, the Reproductive Health Equity Act is a practical necessity and an important statement. \"Oregon has often been at the forefront on health care policy, but there have also been individuals left behind,\" says Amy Casso, the gender justice program director of Oregon's Western States Center. \"We are working to ensure that no one has to be denied necessary lifesaving care.\"", "date": "2017/01/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/oregon-reproductive-health-equity-act", "title": "Oregon Just Showed States How to Fight Back Against the War on Women"}, {"text": "A new survey released today has sparked a debate on both sides of the abortion divide with its finding that the abortion rate has hit its lowest point since the 1970s. The survey, \"Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2014,\" was released by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports abortion rights.  \"If there are women_who want abortions but can't get them because there aren't any clinics that they can get to, and that's why abortion's going down, that's not a good thing,\" the survey's principal researcher, Rachel Jones, told NPR. \"But we think the story that's going on in a lot of situations, in a lot of states, is that fewer women are having unintended pregnancies and in turn fewer abortions, and that is actually a good story.\"  To conduct the survey, researchers collected information from abortion providers across the country, combining the self-reported numbers with state- and national-level population data to get an estimate of how many abortions were performed in each state in 2014. The survey found that the rate of abortion in 2014 was 14.6 per 100,000 peoplemeaning that roughly 19 percent of all pregnancies in 2014 ended in an abortion. That marks the lowest abortion rate recorded since the Supreme Court legalized abortion with its 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. After a consistent decline, the total number of abortions performed in the United States dropped below 1 million for the second year in a row.  The researchers noted that the number of abortions performed in 2014 declined in all but six statesArkansas, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Vermontbut understanding the reasons why this happened is more complicated. The surveys authors acknowledge that abortion restrictions passed in a number of states could have limited abortion access, but they also note that increased access to contraception has likely prevented unintended pregnancies and limited the need for abortion.  Advocates on both sides of the abortion rights debate claimed credit for the good news in the report. In an interview with NPR, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards argued that the lower abortion rate suggests that contraceptive access has improved. Richards said the decline, when coupled with lower incidents of unintended pregnancy and teen pregnancy, \"shows that we're finally doing a better job of helping women get access to birth control that's affordable and that's high-quality.\"  Anti-abortion advocates point to laws regulating clinics, or those that require women to undergo ultrasounds or view information about fetal development before an abortion, as successful deterrents and evidence of the effectiveness of restrictions on reducing abortion. \"These have been game-changers, and we see the abortion rate dropping in response,\" Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick told NPR.  Examining the possible effect that state-level regulations on abortion providers might have had on the lower rate, the researchers found that while the overall number of available providers declined 6 percent between 2011 and 2014, \"reductions were not always associated with declines in abortion incidence.\" The abortion rate declined in some states like New Jersey, where the number of available clinics actually increased, while some states with a reduced numbers of clinics, like Michigan, saw a slight increase in the abortion rate. The researchers also note that 90 percent of counties in the United States did not have a clinic that provided abortions in 2014, leaving almost 40 percent of reproductive-age women without an abortion provider.  Since the survey only analyzed data from 2014, the most recent year that has information available, the effect of more recent abortion restrictions remains unseen. More than 60 new abortion restrictions were passed in 19 states in 2016, and state legislatures have already considered a wave of anti-abortion legislation, from 20-week abortion bans to bills criminalizing abortion, in the first month of 2017. At the federal level, the new Republican-led Congress has pledged to restrict abortion, introducing several abortion restrictions in the past week. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood, a move that would limit reproductive health access for low-income women.", "date": "2017/01/17", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/new-survey-finds-decline-abortions", "title": "Conservatives Are Taking Credit for a Record-Low Abortion Rate. Not So Fast."}, {"text": "Update, January 9: After hours of impassioned debate on Saturday, January 7, the Kentucky House passed the 20- week abortion ban in a 79-15 vote. The Senate also passed the ultrasound measure in a 32-5 vote. Both bills now go to Gov. Matt Bevins desk.  After a year during which 19 states passed more than 60 new restrictions on abortion access, conservative state legislatures are already working overtime to get additional restrictions on the books in 2017. Kentucky launched its offensive earlier this week with the introduction of a 20-week abortion ban and a bill requiring women to receive ultrasounds at least 24 hours before an abortion. Both measures have moved quickly through the Legislature and could become law as soon as this weekend.  The late-term abortion ban, which would prohibit nearly all abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization, was introduced in the state Legislature on Tuesday, the first day of the legislative session. The measure would only allow late-term abortions in medical emergencies that pose a risk of bodily harm or threaten the life of the mother. Early reports suggested the bill would also provide exceptions in cases of rape or incest, but the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Brandon Smith, says that is not the case and the exception does not appear in currently available copies of the legislation. According to a draft of the legislation, physicians who perform late-term abortions in violation of the law could have their medical licenses suspended and be forced to pay punitive damages sought by women who received the procedure.  The legislation has barreled through the committee process, clearing the Senate's Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection Committee Wednesday evening. The measure was brought to the Republican-led Senate Thursday afternoon and sailed through the chamber after a 30-6 vote. The ban now goes to the House, where Speaker Jeff Hoover, a Republican, expects it to pass with \"overwhelming support.\"  The ultrasound measurewhich comes one year after the state passed an informed-consent law requiring women to have a medical consultation at least 24 hours before undergoing an abortionhas also moved quickly, passing the House's Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon. The bill was approved by the Kentucky House on Thursday and will likely clear the Senate when it comes up for a vote.  Local reproductive rights advocates have voiced their frustrations with the fast-tracking of the bills, arguing that the legislation has not been properly screened. \"This legislative session measures are being advanced at unprecedented speed,\" the Kentucky divisions of the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood said in a joint press release, according to the Huffington Post. \"Things are moving so quickly, members of the public and press were unable to obtain copies of the 20-week abortion ban and ultrasound bills before they received a reading and were headed to committee for a vote.\"  But Senate President Robert Stivers was not concerned about the process, telling the Lexington Herald-Leader earlier this week, \"I think we are very well aware of the issues as it relates to this bill and are ready and willing to proceed.\" Stivers added that he would like to see abortion banned even before the 20-week mark.  The Kentucky Legislature is also considering a third abortion-related restriction that would block public funding of Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Federal law already prevents these groups from using public funds to cover abortions, but they do receive money to provide non-abortion health care services to low-income women. On Thursday, GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan said House Republicans would move to strip all federal funding from Planned Parenthood.  In the previous legislative session, Kentucky Republicans controlled the state Senate and the governors mansion, leaving the Democratic-led House as a possible backstop to legislative overreach. But with that chamber falling into Republican control after the November elections, the GOP now has a supermajority in the Legislature and a Republican governor who will likely sign the legislation. Other states with a \"Republican trifecta,\" such as Missouri and Iowa, are also likely to pass extensive abortion restrictions this year. Missouri alone has already seen 14 anti-abortion measures filed in the weeks leading up to the beginning of its legislative session.  The 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion at any point before \"fetal viability\"typically 24 weeks into pregnancy. Nonetheless, 20-week abortion bans are increasingly proving to be an effective approach to limit abortion access. Nearly 20 states have banned late-term abortions in recent years, and other statesVirginia, for exampleare hoping to push though laws this year. Last month, Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a 20-week abortion ban into law after vetoing a \"heartbeat bill\" that would have banned the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Proponents of the measures argue that a fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks, an argument that has been refuted by reproductive rights advocates and has not been confirmed by medical research.  Advocates are still planning their next steps and have not announced if they will file a lawsuit if Kentucky's 20-week ban becomes law. But Republican politicians say they see no problem with their moves to restrict a woman's legal options. \"This is my belief: There are two viable beings involved,\" Stivers said earlier this week. \"One had a choice early on to make a decision to conceive or not. Once conception starts, another life is involved, and the Legislature has the ability to determine how that life proceeds.\"", "date": "2017/01/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/kentucky-gop-pushes-20-week-abortion-ban", "title": "Kentucky Is the Latest State to Consider a 20-Week Abortion Ban"}, {"text": "A decade after deriding her as irresponsible and dishonest, Donald Trump has hired the controversial reality star-turned-political operative Omarosa Manigault to advise him in the White House. The incoming Trump administration announced Wednesday afternoon that Manigault will serve as assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of public liaison.  The hire marks the latest twist in the former Apprentice contestant's longstanding relationship with her reality television boss. Manigault was a prominent surrogate for Trump during the campaign, helping organize a meeting between Trump and several black pastors in 2015. Last year, she served as the vice-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, a grassroots network of nonwhite Trump supporters unaffiliated with the campaign. In July, Manigault officially joined the Trump campaign as the director of African American outreach, overseeing an outreach effort that was frequently criticized for relying on stereotypes of black communities. She currently serves as a member of Trump's transition team.  Despite Manigault's extensive work for his campaign, Trump hasn't always had the highest opinion of her. In a 2004 interview with Playboy, Trump said that she was \"difficult for people to handle\" during her time on The Apprentice and that she was a far better reality TV villain than he had expected. \"I couldn't believe she was lying on camera like she was,\" he said. \"She's got a problem or something.  When asked if he would ever serve as a business reference for Manigault, Trump said that he would not recommend her for an executive position, but that he \"might serve as a reference for her to be on a soap opera.\" He added, \"She's wonderful on TV, and she gets ratings. I just wouldn't necessarily want her running my church.\"  Manigault's new gig won't be her first time working for a presidential administration. She previously worked in the Clinton administration, where, according to People, she was fired from four different jobs in a two-year span. The experience didn't seem to sour Manigault on Democrats: Before Trump jumped into the race, she eagerly voiced her support of Hillary Clinton.  But once her former boss entered the fray, it didn't take long for Manigault to change her tune and her party. \"Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,\" she told PBS's Frontline last year in an interview before the presidential election. \"It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.\"", "date": "2017/01/04", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-hires-omarosa-white-house", "title": "Trump Hires an Adviser He Once Called an Untrustworthy Liar"}, {"text": "Update March 2, 3:30 p.m. ET: After much backlash from animal advocates and lawmakers, the USDA released a statement on February 17 saying it would again post certain animal welfare reports on its website. Not all previously-scrubbed documents will be available, only those pertaining to certain research and federal facilities inspected by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services. Records on animal breeders, zoos, and horse trainers are still unavailable.  Since the original purge of documents on February 3, many lawmakers have taken action. More than 100 signed a letter to President Trump, asking him to make sure the reports were reinstated. Representatives in Oregon also proposed a bill that would force the USDA to re-publish all the reports that were removed from the site.  It may have just gotten a lot harder to spot puppy abusers: A section of the US Department of Agriculture's website that provided documents detailing animal abuse was taken down last Friday, without warning. For more than 10 years, the government agency posted information on violators of the Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act. Citizens, journalists, and animal advocacy organizations like the Humane Society relied on these reports to identify zoos, animal research labs, horse breeders, and dog breeders who violated the laws.  The USDA said in a statement last week that it had taken action after conducting a review of the types of information it posts, and stated that it is committed to the \"privacy of individuals with whom we come into contact.\" The agency said people will now have to file Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain the same information, though this process can take many months, if not years.  \"Here we have a government action that benefits no one except people who are caught abusing animals and don't want the public to know,\" said the Humane Society's John Goodwin.  The Humane Society says three of its campaigns will be deeply affected by the change. John Goodwin, the senior director of the organization's Stop Puppy Mill campaign, uses the reports to create the Horrible Hundreda list of \"puppy mills,\" or producers who breed large numbers of dogs in unsanitary conditions. \"Here we have a government action that benefits no one except people who are caught abusing animals and don't want the public to know,\" Goodwin said.  Marty Irby, a senior director of the Humane Society's Rural Outreach and Equine Protection, likened the reports to the Department of Justice's public information on sex offenders. \"If your neighbor severely abuses a dog who is kept in a cage for breeding purposes and gets caught,\" he said, now \"that person is going to be protected.\" Irby added that the USDA reports provided an easily accessible resource for people looking to buy or show horses. Now, he argues, violators of the Horse Protection Act can more easily hide.  The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service stated that a review of this process has been going on for a year and cited the Privacy Act as a reason for removing the information. Yet the decision came at a time when people are paying extra attention to how Trump's USDA will differ from his predecessor's. As my colleague Tom Philpott reported last December, Brian Klippenstein, the leader of Trump's USDA transition team, lobbied against Humane Society-backed initiatives in Massachusetts that would curb the use of pig gestation stalls and chicken cages in the state. Before he was appointed to the transition team, Klippenstein was the executive director of Protect the Harvest, a nonprofit that aims to \"inform America's consumers, businesses, and decision-makers about the threats posed by animal rights groups and anti-farming extremists.\" The group makes its feelings about the Humane Society clear on its website, dubbing the organization a \"fake charity\" and claiming it wants to put breeders out of business by heavily regulating them.  Klippenstein stepped down as executive director of Protect the Harvest in December. A spokeswoman for the nonprofit told Mother Jones that while it had no involvement in the USDA's decision to remove the reports, the nonprofit is \"concerned about the privacy of people who obey the law\" and that \"all government agencies should be protecting the privacy of people who submit compelling information.\" She later called back to say that Protect the Harvest has no position on the issue.  It's still unclear whether the removal of the information on the USDA website is a permanent change. In the meantime, this isn't just bad news for animal welfare advocates. Since 2011, pet store owners in seven states have been required to source puppies from companies that have no USDA violations. Without these reports, business owners will have a tougher time knowing whether their suppliers violate anti-puppy mill laws.  Investigative reporters have referenced the USDA's documents to uncover and report on animal abuse in the past. Mother Jones senior editor James West used nearly 1,000 USDA documents to investigate severe animal negligence at a roadside zoo in Maine. The zoo owners were subjects of Yankee Jungle, a reality show on Animal Planet that was canceled after MoJo published West's story.  The Humane Society of the United States filed legal action against the USDA on Monday. Goodwin said the organization plans to fight the USDA's decision \"all the way.\" \"The USDA has a lot to explain for denying public access to this information,\" he said.", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/usda-animal-welfare-puppy-mills-trump-humane-society", "title": "How Trump's USDA Could Hurt Puppies"}, {"text": "Lauren Paquette dreams of owning a home with a pool. But the 34-year-old fifth-grade science teacher knows it's a pipe dream: She recently had to find a roommate to help with the monthly rent of $1,425 on her three-bedroom house in Houston. Although that's relatively cheap compared with rents across the country, it's tough on a teacher's salary. Saving up for a down payment is out of the question, said Paquette, a single mother.  \"It's not like I went into this job thinking I'd make a bunch of money, but I expected to be able to make ends meet,\" Paquette said. Finances have been easier since she left North Carolina for Texas (North Carolina ranks in the lower tenth of states for teacher pay), but Paquette's struggles aren't unique.  As housing prices have soared in all the usual major metropolitan areasas well as in cites like Las Vegas, Sacramento, Atlanta, and Minneapolisteachers' wages haven't kept pace. And with school districts already struggling to recruit and retain educators, this rising gap is just another barrier to keeping teachers in the profession.  Redfin, a real estate brokerage firm, compared listed home prices in more than 30 cities with average teachers' salaries to gauge what percentage of available homes teachers could afford. (Administrators, principals, and special-education teachers were not included in the data, and New York City was not studied.) The number of homes within reach for a single teacher has declined in some places by more than 25 percent since 2012.  That's no surprise in San Francisco, where just 14 out of the 2,244 listed houses were within reach on the average teacher salary of $71,000. But the dearth of affordable options has worsened in Las Vegas, Sacramento, Chicago, and Dallas, where in each city less than 25 percent of listed houses are affordable for teachers.  Of course, home ownershiptraditionally an economic engine of the middle classisn't out of reach for just teachers. High housing prices are pushing middle-class workers out of many cities. Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson said the notion that civil servants live in the communities they serve is becoming a thing of the past: \"These are middle-class salaries, but middle-class people can't afford to buy homes.\"  Rental prices mirror the housing market, so teachers who rent are also getting pushed out of the cities in which they teach. Meanwhile, attempts to fix the crisis in Los Angeles have backfired, and other novel solutionslike Sen. Corey Booker's eight-building Teacher Village in Newark, New Jersey, or plans for teacher-only residential units in the San Francisco Bay Areaeither just opened or are still years away. Despite creative housing solutions for our cities' educators, many critics of these plans argue that the real solution is simply paying teachers higher salaries.  David Fisher, the vice president of the Sacramento City Teachers Association, lived in a studio apartment with his wife and son for 15 years before he could afford a house in Sacramento. \"These aren't McMansions in the suburbs,\" Fisher said. \"These are modest houses is modest neighborhoods.\" Besides, he said, most teachers are concerned with paying off student loan debt before even considering buying a home.  There are a few cities where it's not so bad. In Philadelphia, where teachers' salaries saw a 15 percent increase since 2012, more than 35 percent of houses for sale are affordable for teachers. Like most civil servants, teachers have more options anywhere the housing supply is larger.  Paquette, the science teacher, figures that she may be able to buy a house in 10 yearsand says she'll stay in Houston as long as she can afford it. Whether she'll stay in education is another question. \"I get that itch quite often,\" she said, \"to leave the classroom.\"", "date": "2017/02/04", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/buying-house-nearly-impossible-teachers-these-cities", "title": "Buying a Home Is Nearly Impossible for Teachers in These Cities"}, {"text": "More than 1,000 Yemeni-owned shops in New York City are closed today in response to President Donald Trump's \"Muslim ban.\" The executive order, signed last Friday, banned immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Yemen.

The effect, public health advocates worry, would be to further decrease access to substance abuse treatment at a time when drug overdoses are claiming more 50,000 American lives per yearmore than car accidents or gun violence.  Their concerns with the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare, titled the American Health Care Act, fall into two broad categories: The legislation limits who qualifies for public insurance, and it eliminates the requirement that many insurance plans cover substance abuse and mental health treatment.  Freezing Medicaid expansion  One of the most significant (and controversial) parts of Obamacare was a provision that expanded Medicaid to millions more poor Americans. Under the Affordable Care Act, those who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for this government-funded insurance program. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could choose whether or not they wanted to participate in the program, and 31 states have done soresulting in health coverage for an additional 11 million Americans through Medicaid expansion. Of those, an estimated 1.3 million used their newly acquired insurance for substance abuse or mental health services, according to an analysis by researchers Richard Frank of Harvard Medical School and Sherry Glied of New York University.  The Republicans' health care plan would freeze Medicaid expansion, cutting off funds for states adding new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already enrolled in Medicaid expansion plans by 2020 would continue to receive the benefits, but they would be at constant risk of losing that insurance. Anyone who has a gap in insurance coverage of more a monthsay because they miss a deadline or their income temporarily changeswould lose eligibility. (A lack of private health insurance would be penalized too: Going more than 63 days without coverage would increase premiums by 30 percent for a year.) These provisions have a lot of public health advocates worried. It's not uncommon for people, particularly those with serious mental health and addiction problems, to drift in and out of insurance coverage.  Eliminating \"essential\" services  Under Obamacare, insurers are required to offer so-called \"essential health benefits,\" including mental health and substance abuse services. In order to sell insurance, insurers have to cover addiction treatment. (Other essential benefits currently include contraception, preventative care, and emergency serviceshere's the full list). That set of guarantees also applied to how states must structure their Medicaid programs.  The GOP plan would remove the entire package of essential benefit requirements, including mental health and substance abuse treatment, from Medicaid expansion insurance, as well as from some other Medicaid plans. Starting in 2020, each state could choose whether the insurance offered by Medicaid would include these benefits. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), an outspoken critic of the legislation, pressed GOP lawyers on the matter on Wednesday:  .@RepJoeKennedy confirms that the #GOPrepeal bill would remove all essential benefits, incl. #MentalHealth, for Medicaid expansion enrollees pic.twitter.com/oKR43lyeSZ  Energy Commerce Dems (@EnergyCommerce) March 8, 2017  Medicaid, which provides insurance coverage for more than 70 million Americans, is the largest payer for addiction services across the country. Eliminating a chunk of that funding could be particularly crippling for many of the communities that voted Trump into office, notes Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who advised the Obama administration on drug policy.  West Virginia and Ohio, for example, have some of the highest rates of opioid overdoses in the country. In those states, which both adopted Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, Medicaid pays for more than 40 percent of the cost of buprenorphine, a life-saving opioid addiction medication. \"This will hurt the worst in the places that supported these politicians the most,\" says Humphreys. \"They voted in this Congress that is now going to stick a knife in them.\"", "date": "2017/03/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/trumpcare-ryancare-disaster-mental-health-addiction-treatment", "title": "Trumpcare Would Make America's Opioid Epidemic Even Worse"}, {"text": "After the GOP's Obamacare replacement was revealed on Monday night, President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation.

Here's what they're saying. We'll keep this list updated as more reactions come in.  GOP senators who think Trumpcare would harm Medicaid recipients  One of the most significant, and controversial, parts of Obamacare was a provision enabling states to greatly expand Medicaid coverage for poor residents. In the 31 states that opted to expand Medicaid, anyone earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid. But under Monday's version of the legislation, enrollment would freeze on January 1, 2020: After that, Americans in those 31 states would no longer be eligible to sign up for Medicaid under the Obamacare conditions.  Four Republican senators from states that expanded MedicaidRob Portman (Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (W. Va.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)penned a letter to Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shortly before the latest version of the bill was released Monday expressing concern that an earlier draft of the replacement \"does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion programs.\" While the senators support replacing Obamacare, they say they won't vote for \"a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states.\" There's no indication that Monday's version of the bill addressed their concerns. Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three votesfour would prevent the bill's passage unless a Democrat votes for it.  We need to protect Medicaid expansion populations & provide more flexibility for states:https://t.co/LeTYvlw0H8  Rob Portman (@senrobportman) March 6, 2017  Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, told Katie Couric that she \"has a lot of concerns\" about the billparticularly the estimates that 6 to 10 million people could lose their health insurance. Collins objected to the roll-back of Medicaid expansion and also warned that the bill could increase health care costs for seniors. In addition, Collins opposed to a provision in the bill defunding Planned Parenthood. (Under Obamacare, Planned Parenthood can accept Medicaid funding for non-abortion procedures.) \"In my state, Planned Parenthood provides essential health care services to more than 10,000 people,\" she said. \"Where are those people going to go?\" Murkowski has made similar arguments.  GOP lawmakers who think Trumpcare is too close to Obamacare  Many more Republican lawmakers have criticized the GOP bill for not going far enough to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They see the new legislation as a betrayal Republicans' promises to repeal Obamacare altogether.  The House Freedom Caucusa group of about three dozen conservative members of Congressblasted the replacement bill for being another \"entitlement program\" that offers refundable tax credits to poor Americans. \"This is Obamacare by a different form,\" said former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to Politico. \"There's nothing 'wonderful' about the GOP plan,\" tweeted Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.). \"It repackages Obamacare, breaks promises & doesn't lower costs.\" Some other conservative Republicans agreed. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) called the bill a \"stinking pile of garbage\" written by the \"insurance lobby,\" according to the Washington Examiner.  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been outspoken in calling for a full repeal of Obamacare, said the GOP legislation was \"dead on arrival.\" Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) expressed similar frustration, calling the bill a \"missed opportunity and a step in the wrong direction.\"  Th House leadership plan is Obamacare Lite. It will not pass. Conservarives are not going to take it. #FullRepeal  Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 7, 2017  Conservative advocacy groups and think tanks  Major conservative and libertarian groups have denounced the legislation, urging congressional Republicans to go further in dismantling Obamacare.  Americans for Prosperity launched the #YouPromised campaign, demanding \"full repeal.\" Monday's legislation \"falls far short of the promises Republicans made to the American people in four consecutive federal elections,\" AFP President Tim Phillips told The Hill.  The replacement will make coverage unaffordable for millions, Congress. Go back to the drawing board. #YouPromised https://t.co/3SyF3fcNSk  AFP (@AFPhq) March 8, 2017  Heritage Action for America CEO Michael Needham called the GOP legislation \"bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy.\" He added, \"Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act.\"  BREAKING: The new GOP plan is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. https://t.co/OJGI8sVC6d pic.twitter.com 5JEuiykJto  Heritage Action (@Heritage_Action) March 7, 2017  FreedomWorks public policy director Jason Pye called the legislation \"ObamaCare-lite,\" saying that a provision allowing insurers to charge more for consumers who don't keep continuous coverage is \"an individual mandate by another name.\"  Club for Growth President David McIntosh called the bill a \"warmed-over substitute for government-run health care.\" He added, \"The problems with this bill are not just what's in it, but also what's missing: namely, the critical free-market solution of selling health insurance across state lines.\"  CATO Institute health policy expert Michael Cannon denounced the legislation on Fox News as \"a fresh coat of paint on a building the Republicans have already condemned.\"  .@CatoInstitute's @mfcannon describes the Obamacare repeal as a \"train wreck waiting to happen\" in his latest post: https://t.co/MwdeRXHQR1  Cato Press (@CatoPress) March 7, 2017  Conservative news outlets  Breitbart News, which Trump strategist Steve Bannon ran for years, published headlines including, \"Obamacare 2.0 Guts Enforcement, Gives Illegal Aliens Health Care Through Identity Fraud\" and \"Conservatives: Paul Ryan\"s Healthcare Plan Replaces Obamacare with Obamacare-Lite.\"  \"Conservatives: Paul Ryan\"s Healthcare Plan Replaces Obamacare with Obamacare-Lite.\" The National Review called the replacement a \"disappointing start\" because it doesn't repeal all of the Obamacare regulations.  Medical and patient groups  The American Medical Association, the nation's largest physicians group, sent a letter to Congress opposing the replacement because, the organization argues, it would make coverage unattainable for vulnerable populations. \"By replacing income-based premium subsidies with age-based tax credits, the AHCA will also make coverage more expensiveif not out of reachfor poor and sick Americans,\" said AMA President Dr. Andrew Gurman.  ACA replacement, as written, is not a bill the AMA can support -- reductions in coverage are too critical a flaw. https://t.co/pbXPPuX7wz pic.twitter.com/DjPDypiVit  AMA (@AmerMedicalAssn) March 8, 2017  The American Hospital Association and six other hospital groups penned a letter to Congress with similar concerns, saying the replacement would \"result in a substantial reduction in the number of Americans able to buy affordable health insurance or maintain coverage under the Medicaid program.\"  The American Nurses Association, which strongly backed Obamacare, tweeted, \"The #AHCA threatens health care affordability, access, & delivery for individuals across the nation. Therefore, we oppose. #ProtectOurCare\"  The AARP, which represents nearly 40 million older Americans, opposed the legislation in a letter to Congress arguing that the act would increase the cost of health care for older people. The criticism also took the form of a snarky video in which a squirrel helps explain the harmful impact of what the group calls the bill's \"age tax.\" Older Americans generally spend more on health care, but under Obamacare, insurance companies couldn't charge them more than three times as much as younger clients. The replacement bill pushes that ratio to 5-to-1. According to the group, the age band provision is \"Washington politician speak for overcharging older Americans for their health insurance while lining the insurance companies' pockets.\"  RETWEET: The age tax would force Americans age 50-64 to pay thousands of $$$ more for health care.

Last week, Alaska became the latest state to declare the opioid epidemic a public health disaster.  President Donald Trump has particularly strong support in areas that have been hit hard by the crisis. Yet if Obamacare is repealed, as Trump has repeatedly promised, thousands of Americans would lose access to their daily or weekly treatment for opioid addiction.  Here's what gutting Obamacare would mean for the people who depend on it to fight America's opioid epidemic:  What's the connection between the opioid epidemic and Trump?  Kathleen Frydl, a historian and the author of The Drug Wars in America, recently found that in nearly every Ohio and Pennsylvania county with high drug overdose rates, Trump's share of the 2016 vote was 10 points higher than Romney's in 2012, Clinton's share was 10 points lower than Obama's in 2012, or both. While the link between the drug epidemic and Trump's popularity is circumstantial, \"When you're dealing with counties that have overflowing hospital parking lots, the message that America is already great doesn't resonate with people,\" Frydl says.  It's not just overdoses: Trump overperformed in counties with high rates of \"deaths of despair,\" or deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide, according to research by Penn State sociologist Shannon Monnat. Counties with high despair death rates and high Trump turnout weren't necessarily the poorest, but they were, generally speaking, financially worse off than they were a generation ago. \"They're places that have been experiencing economic downturn for at least the last three decades,\" Monnat says. \"There's been a heavy loss in manufacturing jobs, natural resource extraction jobsthere's a sense in these places that there's been a dismantling of the American dream.\"  Where are people most reliant on Obamacare for addiction treatment?  What has health advocates particularly worried is that the states with the highest overdose rates also rely the most on Obamacare. West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Massachusetts, have the first, second, third, and seventh highest overdose rates in the country, respectively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of uninsured residents in those four states would roughly triple if the ACA were repealed.  These maps from the Department of Health and Human Services show this overlap. In the first map, red states have the highest overdose rates; in the second, red states have the most residents per capita who would lose their insurance if Obamacare is repealed.  What would repealing Obamacare mean for addiction treatment?  If Obamacare disappears, nearly 3 million Americans with addiction disorders would lose some or all of their health insurance coverage, according to recent research by Richard Frank and Sherry Glied, professors of health economics at Harvard and public service at New York University, respectively. Of those, about 222,000 would lose opioid addiction treatment.  Last December, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act, which will allocate $1 billion over the next two years to expand access to opioid addiction treatment. But Frank and Glied estimate that repealing the ACA provisions that address substance abuse and mental disorders would take away at least $5.5 billion annually from the treatment of low-income Americans with mental health and addiction disorders. A one-time $1-billion increase in spending would \"not even serve as much of a bandage,\" they write.  Why is Obamacare a big deal for opioid treatment?  The ACA has been particularly important for those seeking addiction treatment, says Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who advised the Obama administration on drug policy. \"It was designed to be very broad, but at the same time we knew that if there was anything that this would help a lot for, it's addiction,\" he says.  Before the ACA went into effect, a third of individual market insurance policies didn't cover substance abuse treatment, including medications like buprenorphine that have proven critical to keeping former opioid users off of drugs. The ACA deemed substance abuse and mental health treatment to be essential health benefits, and now insurance plans are required to cover them. In states that expanded Medicaid, 20 percent of hospital admissions for substance abuse and mental health disorders were uninsured in 2013, before the bulk of the expansion provisions kicked in. By the middle of 2015, the uninsured rate had fallen to five percent.  In addition, Obamacare covers Americans who are are most at risk of becoming addicted to opioids: People with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty line have a 50 percent higher risk of having an opioid problem than people with higher incomes. Humphreys adds that most users start using heroin or pain-killers when they're young. Since the ACA lets children stay on their parents' health insurance until they're 26, it's easier for young users to access treatment.  Without the ACA, says Humphreys, \"We're back where we were before: bad access, low quality of care, and a lot of patients being turned away.\"  What could Obamacare do better?  The ACA hasn't fixed everything. While it's increased the number of people with coverage, there's still not nearly enough treatment capacity, leading to big gap between the number of people who have treatment and those who need it. About 420,000 people who suffer from opioid addiction don't have access treatment. Frank and Glied estimate that repealing the ACA would widen this treatment gap by 50 percent, bringing the number Americans who can't get opioid treatment to 640,000.  Apart from the ACA, there's the more general issue that federal funding for addiction treatment and services has flatlined over the past decade, says Andrew Kessler, founder of health policy consulting firm Slingshot Solutions. Overall, states get about two thirds of their funding for addiction prevention from Department of Health and Human Services block grantsand given the rate of inflation, those grants have lost about a quarter of their purchasing power. Under Mick Mulvaney, the former representative from South Carolina who was confirmed as Trump's budget director last week, \"we're bracing for a very austere budget,\" says Kessler.  What will come after Obamacare?  Congressional Republicans have long promised to repeal Obamacare. Many proposals that Republicans have put forward, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's \"A Better Way,\" would eliminate the requirement for insurance policies to cover essential benefits, including substance abuse and mental health treatment.  This has some GOP leaders worried. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose state has been hit particularly hard by the opioid epidemic, warned fellow Republicans in January about the implications of Obamacare repeal. \"What happens to drug treatment, what happens to mental health counseling?\" he asked. As Humphreys puts it, Republicans \"ought to realize that they will really harm their own constituents pretty substantially if they took this away.\"", "date": "2017/02/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/affordable-care-act-obamacare-substance-abuse-opioids", "title": "Gutting Obamacare Would Leave 3 Million Americans Without Drug Treatment"}, {"text": "When Tyler Tabor was booked in a jail outside Denver on a spring afternoon in 2015, he told a screening nurse that he was a daily heroin user and had a prescription for Xanax. A friendly, outdoorsy 25-year-old with a son in kindergarten, Tabor had started using opioids after he injured his back on the job as a welder. When he was arrested on two misdemeanor warrants, his parents decided not to pay his $300 bail, thinking he would be safer in jail and away from heroin for a few days.  Three days later, Tabor died of dehydration at the Adams County jail, according to a coroner's report. The alleged cause: drug withdrawal.  A lawsuit filed by the Tabors against the county and Corizon Health, the jail's private health care provider, describes in chilling detail the three days of missed opportunities and seemingly callous medical care. It draws on video footage, some of which is shown below, from a surveillance camera in Tabor's cell. By the end of the first day in jail, Tabor was in the throes of severe withdrawal: vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure. He was too dehydrated to provide a urine sample. A day later, he could no longer walk or unclench his fingers. When a nurse came by to give him the usual withdrawal medicationsa cocktail of things like Gatorade and Pepto Bismolhe fell to the ground, trembling. Later that night, he begged for an IVhe knew from a previous detox that withdrawing from the combination of heroin, an opioid, and Xanax, a benzodiazepine, was particularly risky. But, according to the complaint, he was told IVs were only used when \"absolutely necessary.\" He died six hours later, leaving behind a wife and a five-year-old son.  \"A simple IV would have almost certainly saved his life,\" reads the complaint.  Adams County officials declined to comment on the case. Martha Harbin, a spokesperson for Corizon Health, said the allegations in the complaint were \"inconsistent with the known facts.\" She added, \"It certainly is not our policy to deny a patient appropriate and indicated treatment.\"  Yet as the nationwide opioid epidemic continues to spiral, more and more inmates who use heroin, painkillers, or methadone are showing up in jails across the country, where withdrawal treatment can be rudimentary. \"So many more people are coming in hooked on opioids,\" says David Lane, the attorney representing the Tabors. \"If the jails are not trained and they're not ready for it, you get a Tyler Tabor.\"  No organization tracks how many people have died from drug withdrawal in jail, but Mother Jones found 20 lawsuits filed between 2014 and 2016 alleging that an inmate died from opiate withdrawal complications. That number likely represents just a fraction of all jail withdrawal deaths, Lane says. In addition to the counties, many families also sue the companies that public jails often contract with to provide health carelike Corizon Health, in the Tabors' case.  By the time of Tabor's death, in May, at least four other inmates in jails around the country had died that year from complications of opiate withdrawal, according to lawsuits filed by their families. In March, 37-year-old Jennifer Lobato was booked into Colorado's Jefferson County jail, just a half hour from where Tabor would die, for shoplifting $57 of merchandise from Old Navy with her son. A guard scoffed at Lobato, a regular heroin user, as she vomited before collapsing, according to a subsequent investigation by the sheriff's office. A month later, an 18-year-old aspiring artist named Tori Herr collapsed in Pennsylvania's Lebanon County jail. \"I just want something to drink,\" she said to her mom on the phone days before she died. \"I want lemonade.\"  Jefferson County settled the Lobato case for $2.5 million last fall. County spokesman Mark Techmeyer said the jail's withdrawal treatment and evaluation protocols changed in response to Lobato's death; Lebanon County officials declined to comment on the Herr case.  Outside of jails, dying from opiate withdrawal is exceedingly rare because, with few exceptions, it is so preventable. Dehydration, the withdrawal symptom that usually kills people, can be treated with intravenous fluids. It's nearly unheard of to withdraw from opioids without slowly tapering or having emergency medical care, says Kevin Fiscella, an addiction specialist who sits on the board of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), which accredits correctional health services. \"What's happening in jails, it's kind of a natural experiment to see what happens,\" he says. \"And in fact some people do die.\"  When a user quits opioids cold turkey, the body quickly starts to experience the opposite effects of the original drug, resulting in a rarely fatal but often tortuous withdrawal process that can persist for days or weeks. Where opioids reduce pain, withdrawal makes the body hypersensitive to it. Opioids induce euphoria; withdrawal feels like the world is going to end. Opioids cause constipation; withdrawal causes diarrhea and vomiting. If a person going through withdrawal can't keep fluids down and is not given an IV, he or she can succumb to dehydration.  \"I can't assess somebody three times a shift when there's one nurse for 700 inmates.\"  Fiscella notes that a number of factors can make withdrawal behind bars risky. Inmates don't always tell nurses during the screening process that they're drug users; sometimes, withdrawal kicks off a domino effect that makes other health conditions, like heart problems, act up. Lots of opioid users are also on benzodiazepines like Xanax or Valium, known for enhancing and extending the effects of heroin, painkillers, or methadone. Benzodiazepines can make withdrawal much more dangerous.  What's more, many cash-strapped jails lack basic medications or medical equipment like IVs. And often, Fiscella says, there simply aren't enough health care staff to check in regularly on each and every withdrawal patient. \"In a lot of these deaths, people were simply ignored,\" he says.  Of the 20 alleged opiate withdrawal deaths in jails that Mother Jones found, five occurred in jails served by a privately held company called Correct Care Solutions. Based in Tennessee, CCS is one of the country's largest correctional health care services, providing medical services to 250,000 patients in jails, prisons, state hospitals, and forensic treatment centers throughout the country.  In 2015, the company brought in nearly $1 billion in revenue, according to the Nashville Business Journal. CCS President Patrick Cummiskey told the Journal that the company had \"grown 20 percent-plus annually since inception, so growth is our norm.\"  Despite the company's robust finances, treating withdrawal can fall through the cracks, according to four jail nurses who currently or recently worked for Correct Care Solutions. Their names have been changed to protect their privacy.  During the evening shift at the Brown County jail in Green Bay, Wisconsin, there is one nurseand no other medical stafffor roughly 700 inmates, according to nurses who worked at the facility. \"I had people detoxing, I had people with chest pain, I had people getting into fights, I had emergencies where people aren't breathing,\" said Abby, who worked at the facility for nine months before leaving last fall. \"I can't assess somebody three times a shift when there's one nurse for 700 inmates, and do a meaningful assessment, and also provide interventions when I have 20 people on opiate withdrawal.\"  Abby says she bought her own medical supplies because the blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and stethoscopes provided by CCS didn't always work. She often found herself stuck between a rock and a hard place: There was no IV therapy in the jail, but sending inmates to the hospital was frowned upon. In order to send a withdrawal patient to the hospital, she said, the inmate would \"need to be at the point where their vital signs were dropping, their internal organs were starting to become compromised.\"  Abby left CCS last fall because she was worried that the quality of care at the jail was so low that she was violating her nursing license. \"If I was called into court, I couldn't say truthfully that I am providing good nursing care,\" she said.  Brown County declined to comment for this article.  Greta, a nurse at a different jail served by CCS, described a similar scene. During a typical medical check, Greta had about 30 seconds to take an inmate's vital signs, hand out medications, and gauge withdrawal symptomsoften in dim lighting and always standing next to a deputy jail guard. On top of it, she said, \"You're using your eyes and your ears because you don't really have technology. You're lucky to have a blood pressure cuff.\"  Asked about the allegations, CCS spokesman Jim Cheney wrote in an email to Mother Jones, \"While it is very difficult to respond to an anonymous source when determining the credibility of their assertion, CCS employs regional executives across the country to ensure that the service standards we have established are upheld. It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which a facility was not provided the instruments necessary for routine healthcare, and should there be a need, our nurses have immediate and direct access to administrative teams who can facilitate those resources in short-order.\" He added that the staffing ratio is determined by \"facility capabilities,\" and the company does not frown upon the use of outside providers. In the event that the medical needs of an inmate fall beyond what the facility can provide, he said, \"we rely on our medical partners in the community for support.\"  But in some cases no one calls for support before it's too late. A video strikingly similar to that of Tabor shows David Stojcevski, a 32-year-old from outside Detroit, losing 50 pounds over 16 days of vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling on the ground before his death in the summer of 2014. Stojcevski had been booked at the Macomb County Jail, also served by CCS, for being unable to pay a $772 fine for driving carelessly. Though he notified nurses of his prescriptions to methadone and Xanax, an opioid and a benzodiazepine, respectively, he never received either medication in jail, according to a lawsuit later filed by his parents.  A Department of Justice investigation of the case found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of Macomb County or CCS, saying there wasn't enough evidence that jail staff acted with criminal intent to prosecute the case. The lawsuit filed by the family is ongoing; county officials declined to comment on the case. Cheney described CCS's withdrawal protocol as \"one of most advanced and respected in the industry,\" adding that CCS follows standards from the NCCHC and the American Correctional Association. He added that \"while tragic situations do occur, there are exponentially more circumstances in which our professionals save lives and improve the health of the individuals that they treat.\"  \"I feel like I am very close to death,\" one inmate wrote on a medical form shortly before she died. \"Can't hear, seeing lights, hearing voices. Please help me.\"  Corizon Health, the health care provider in Tabor's case and the nation's largest privately held correctional health company, is currently facing at least one other lawsuit alleging an opiate withdrawal death. A year before Tabor died, Madaline Pitkin, a 26-year-old from Portland, Oregon, died of heroin withdrawal after repeatedly requesting help on medical forms, according to a lawsuit filed by her family. In her final request, she wrote, \"This is a 3rd or 4th call for help. I haven't been able to keep food, liquids, meds down in 6 days_I feel like I am very close to death. Can't hear, seeing lights, hearing voices. Please help me.\"  Harbin, the Corizon spokesperson, declined to comment on the specifics of Tabor's or Pitkin's cases because of active litigation and patient privacy rules. \"One of the most common misconceptions about our company is that we somehow benefit from providing lower quality care,\" she wrote in an email. \"To the contrary, what makes good medical sense and good business sense is proactive preventive careintervening early to treat conditions before they become serious and more costly to treat.\"  Tabor's family, meanwhile, is still reeling from their loss. Tyler's son, D.T., an energetic six-year-old who loves fishing and biking, still regularly asks when his dad will come home. Tyler's father, Ray, a manager at the local Safeway, tells D.T. that he went to heaven. \"It's one thing to lose a child,\" says Ray. \"But it's another thing knowing that he died in a jail cell alone on the floor, asking for help.\"", "date": "2017/02/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/opioid-withdrawal-jail-deaths", "title": "Go to Jail.

The daughter of Chinese dissidents, Wen grew up in inner-city Los Angeles, where she saw classmates and neighbors suffer from gun violence and drug addiction. At 18, she graduated summa cum laude from California State University. Then came medical school and residency, a Rhodes Scholarship, and work as a professor and emergency room physician at the George Washington University hospital. All the while, Wen made a name for herself as a patient advocate, giving several TED talks and penning a book, When Doctors Don't Listen.  It leads people in our city to wonder, is it because there are now white people in suburban and rural areas that are dying from overdose?  Her boundless energy is needed in Baltimore. The city of 600,000 has one of the highest overdose rates of any city, with 393 fatal overdoses in 2015. During her tenure, Wen has revamped the way the city responds to clusters of overdose calls and made it easier for drug users and their families and friends to access naloxone, the overdose reversal drug. On the city's overdose prevention campaign, DontDie.org, she demonstrates how to use it. Last spring, she testified before Congress and spoke on a panel with President Barack Obama about the city's approach to addressing the crisis.  Despite the whirlwind jobWen works \"all the hours,\" as her assistant told The Atlantic's Olga Khazanthe commissioner takes the long view when it comes to the drug epidemic making the headlines. Substance abuse and addiction aren't new to Baltimore, she argues, and they're at the root of seemingly unrelated problems that the city has faced for years. Shortly after the death of Freddie Gray, she wrote a pointed Washington Post op-ed about how the beleaguered city's high arrest and incarceration rates and seemingly intractable poverty draw back to the need for substance abuse and mental health treatment. \"Other reforms will not be successful unless these core issues are resolved,\" she wrote.  I talked to Wen about the stigma around addiction and the city's response to the drug overdose crisis.  Mother Jones: Baltimore's been getting a lot of attention for the opioid crisis there. What's going on?  Leana Wen: The issues of addiction tie into every part of our city: poverty, health disparities, mental health, unemployment, lack of housing. Traditionally, it's been seen that if you have an addiction, it's a moral failing. It's a personal choice. Now, we're calling it a disease. It leads people in our city to wonder, is it because there are now white people in suburban and rural areas that are dying from overdose? We have faced overdose and addiction in our city for decadesit is relatively newer to many other parts of the country.  MJ: How does stigma against drug users affect your work?  LW: There are people in our city dying of overdose at nearly twice the number of those dying from homicide. Around the country, there are more people dying from overdose than there are dying from car accidents. If there were tens of thousands of people dying from any other disease, we would have declared it a public health emergency of epic proportions. Imagine if tens of thousands of people were dying of Zika, or tens of thousands of people are dying of measleswe would be doing everything we can to address it. But unfortunately there is so much stigma surrounding addiction and there is so much misunderstanding about the nature of addiction, we as a society have not understood it to be the disease that it is.  MJ: How is Baltimore tackling this?  LW: We have taken a three-pillar approach in Baltimore. We have to focus on getting naloxone, also called Narcan, into every single person's hands. We got legislation changed so that I am now the single prescriber to every resident in our city for naloxone. We've done 18,000 [naloxone administration] trainings this past year. Everyday people have saved the lives of 620 of their fellow residents because of our efforts. The first focus is on saving lives [and] getting naloxone into everyone's hands.  The second thing: We have to increase capacity for treatment. The recent surgeon general's report found that only 1 in 10 people with a disease of addiction can access the treatment that they needwhich we would never find accessible for any other disease. We started a 24/7 phone hotline for anyone to access for anything related to substance use. We are working on center to [provide] 24/7 treatment at the time that people need.  The third pillar is increased education and reducing stigma. We started a city wide [naloxone education] campaign called Don't Die. We're also educating our doctors on better ways to prescribe pain medications to avoid people from getting addicted in the first place.  MJ: You recently wrote a Baltimore Sun op-ed about the high cost of prescription drugs. Has cost been a big issue when it comes to opioid treatment in Baltimore?  LW: Absolutely. We are limited by the amount of naloxone that we can provide because unfortunately the cost of naloxone has skyrocketedmore than doubled in the last couple of years. There should be no reason as to why this medication is suddenly so expensive. Also, treatment capacity just isn't there. For substance abuse disorder, we know the treatment that works is a combination of medication and psychosocial treatment. It's important that we have all of those services available at the time that someone needs it. It's inappropriate and costing individuals lives if they're unable to get treatment at the time that they need.  MJ: Baltimore has seen a big spike in fentanyl-related deaths. How are you handling the influx of fentanyl?  That's our message: There is fentanyl here, so be wary and help each other.  LW: Fentanyl is a substance that I know personally very well because I use it in my medical practice in the ER. Fentanyl is many times stronger than morphine, it's dozens of times stronger than heroin, so if it's mixed in with other drugs and the person using it doesn't know, then that person could be overdosing and dyingwhich is what we're seeing. We know based on medical examiner data that we have a serious issue with fentanyl in our city: There are nearly 20 times the number of people dying from fentanyl now compared to [2013] in Baltimore. Fentanyl, as we understand it, is being trafficked in from China, Mexico, other placesand so the law enforcement side of targeting trafficking is important. Our side, though, involves educating individuals who use substances about the substances.  MJ: Do you track when fentanyl is making its way into the drug supply on the street?  LW: We have a system where we get real-time alerts form hospitals, from EMS, from fire departments, and from police on where it is that overdose clusters are occurring. We're then deploying outreach teams immediately to let [users] know that there is now fentanyl in their area. Very likely what has occurred is that there is a batch of drugs being sold within that area, within a small radius, that has high concentrations of fentanyl. This is a relatively new issue across the country so we don't have data on whether this particular method is successfulwe just launched it a couple months ago.  MJ: What does that outreach look like?  LW: We have individuals who often are in recovery themselves and are trusted members of the community to do outreach. They'll go to street corners, they'll go to our needle exchange vans, they'll go to wherever it is that people are to let them know about fentanyl and teach them about naloxone use and hand out Narcan. It's targeted outreach by individuals who are from the communities that they're serving.  MJ: Fentanyl is not always lethal, thoughwhat if users want the strong high from fentanyl?  LW: The mind of someone who is addicted to drugs is hard to understandthere are individuals who want the strong stuff. We have found in our city that people who use drugs all know someone who has overdosed, they all know about the problem of fentanyl. And our message will always be, please get into treatment, please stop using drugs. But our other message is, now that there's fentanyl out there, please don't use drugs alone. Please make sure that you're trained to use Narcan so that you can help save someone's life if they're overdosing. That's our message: There is fentanyl here, so be wary and help each other.", "date": "2017/01/25", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/opioids-baltimore-public-health-leana-wen", "title": "Meet the 33-Year-Old Genius Solving Baltimore's Opioid Crisis"}, {"text": "E-cigarettes, long touted as a tool to discourage smoking, are actually doing the opposite, according to a landmark study published Monday in Pediatrics. In this first-of-its kind national analysis, researchers found that the devices attract kids who otherwise would not have been likely to pick up smoking.  \"E-cigarettes are encouragingnot discouragingyouth to smoke and to consume nicotine, and are expanding the tobacco market,\" said a study co-author.  \"E-cigarettes are encouragingnot discouragingyouth to smoke and to consume nicotine, and are expanding the tobacco market,\" said Stanton Glantz, a co-author and director of the University of California-San Francisco Center for Tobacco Control Research.  Last year, the Food and Drug Administration announced sweeping regulation of e-cigarettes, which included restricting purchase by those under 18.  The researchers analyzed data from the Center for Disease Control's National Youth Tobacco Survey between 2004 and 2014, completed by more than 140,000 middle and high schoolers. They found that while cigarette smoking rates declined, the introduction of e-cigarettes had no effect on the decline. Meanwhile, the total use of tobacco products (cigarettes combined with e-cigarettes) has increased. That's concerning, the researchers say, since several longitudinal studies have found that kids who use e-cigarettes are three times more likely to smoke cigarettes a year later.  Past research has found that certain characteristics measured in the CDC surveylike living with a smoker, wearing clothing with a tobacco company logo, or saying they would accept cigarettes from a friendare predictors of a teen's likelihood of picking up smoking.  But the Pediatrics study found that e-cigarette smokers displayed fewer of these characteristics, leading the researchers to conclude that e-cigarettes are attracting a new population rather than just being used by existing smokers.  Gregory Conley, the president of the American Vaping Association, says that the study's findings \"strain credulity,\" as youth smoking is rapidly declining, teens typically use vapor products occasionally rather than habitually, and \"only a fraction of recent users report using the products with nicotine.\"  Lauren Dutra, a study co-author and researcher at RTI International, counters that smoking rates were already falling before the advent of e-cigarettes, and that nicotine levels in e-cigarettes are not yet regulated by the FDA.  \"I don't want to say if e-cigarettes didn't exist, these kids never would have been exposed to nicotine,\" says Dutra. But \"perhaps these kids wouldn't have picked up a cigarette or wouldn't have used nicotine at all had it not been for the existence of e-cigarettes on the market.\"", "date": "2017/01/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/e-cigarettes-encouraging-youth-smoking", "title": "Giant Study Shows That\u0089\u00db\u00d3Surprise!\u0089\u00db\u00d3Vaping Entices Non-Smokers"}, {"text": "This story originally appeared on ProPublica.  Donald Trump's selection of Rick Perry to lead the Department of Energy has prompted many Democrats to question Perry's qualifications for the position. While he governed a state rich in fossil fuels and wind energy, Perry has far less experience than President Barack Obama's two energy secretaries, both physicists, in the department's primary work, such as tending the nuclear-weapons stockpile, handling nuclear waste and carrying out advanced scientific research. That's not to mention, of course, that Perry four years ago called for doing away with the entire department.  However, there's one realm in which Perry will have plenty of preparation: doling out taxpayer money in the form of government grants to the energy industry.  What often gets lost in all the talk of the Texas job boom under Perry is how much economic development strategy was driven by direct subsidies to employers who promised to relocate to the state or create jobs there. Of course, many states have for years engaged in the game of luring companies with tax incentives. But by the count of a 2012 New York Times investigation, Texas under Perry vaulted to the top, giving out $19 billion in incentives per year, more than any other state.  There's one realm in which Perry will have plenty of preparation: doling out taxpayer money in the form of government grants to the energy industry.  Perry's economic development largesse came in many forms, but among the most high-profile were two big pots of money that he created while in office. In 2003, he founded the Texas Enterprise Fund, which he pitched as a way to help him close the deal in bidding wars for large employers thinking of moving to the state. Over the course of Perry's tenure, which ended in early 2015, the fund gave out more than $500 million. In 2005, Perry created the Emerging Technology Fund, which was intended for startups. It gave out $400 million before being shuttered last year by his Republican successor, Greg Abbott.  Disbursements from both funds were controlled by Perry, the lieutenant governor and the speaker of the House. The technology fund had a 17-member advisory board, all appointed by Perry. With such scant oversight, it did not take long for political favoritism and cronyism to creep into the programs. In 2010, the Texas Observer reported that 20 of the 55 Enterprise Fund grant recipients up to that point had contributed directly to Perry's campaign or the Republican Governor's Association, of which he became chairman in 2010. Also in 2010, the the Dallas Morning News reported that some $16 million from the Emerging Technology Fund had gone to firms backed by major donors to Perry. For instance, after Joe Sanderson received a $500,000 Enterprise Fund grant to build a poultry plant in Waco in 2006, he gave Perry $25,000. And the Emerging Technology Fund gave $4.75 million to two firms backed by James Leininger, a hospital bed manufacturer and school voucher proponent who had helped arrange a last-minute $1.1 million loan to Perry in his successful 1998 run for lieutenant governor and contributed $239,000 to his campaigns over the ensuing decade.  In theory, companies receiving Enterprise Fund grants were accountable for their job creation pledges and had to make refunds when they fell short. In practice, the numbers proved hard to quantify and few companies had to make refunds. The watchdog group Texans for Public Justice determined that by the end of 2010, companies had created barely more than a third of the jobs promised, even with Perry's administration having lowered the standard for counting jobs. And in 2014, the state auditor found that $222 million had been given out to companies that hadn't even formally applied for funds or made concrete promises for job creation. \"The final word on the funds is that they were first and foremost political, to allow [Perry] to stand in front of a podium and say that he was bringing jobs back to Texas,\" said Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for Public Justice. \"From the very start those funds lacked transparency and accountability.\"  This being Texas, it was not surprising that many of the leading beneficiaries of the taxpayer funds were in the energy industry.  This being Texas, it was not surprising that many of the leading beneficiaries of the taxpayer funds were in the energy industry. Citgo got $5 million from the Enterprise Fund when it moved to the state from Tulsa in 2004, even though it made clear that it had strategic reasons to move there regardless of the incentive. Chevron got $12 million in 2013 after agreeing to build a 50-story office tower in downtown Houstona building that three years later remained unbuilt.  Most revealing of the problems associated with the Perry model of taxpayer-funded economic development, though, may have been a $30 million grant in 2004 to a lesser-known outfit called the Texas Energy Center. The center was created in 2003 to be a public-private consortium for research and innovation in so-called clean-coal technology, deep-sea drilling, and other areas. Not coincidentally, it was located in the suburban Houston district of Rep. Tom DeLay, the powerful House Republican, who, it was envisioned, would steer billions in federal funding to the center, with the help of Washington lobbyists hired by the Perry administration, including DeLay's former chief of staff, Drew Maloney.  But the federal windfall didn't come through, and the Enterprise Fund grant was cut to $3.6 million, which was to be used as incentives for energy firms in the area. Perry made the award official with a 2004 visit to the Sugar Land office of the Greater Fort Bend Economic Development Council, one of the consortium's members, housed inside the glass tower of the Fluor Corporation. In 2013, when I visited Sugar Land for an article on Perry's economic development approach, his administration still listed the Texas Energy Center as a going concern that had nearly reached its target of 1,500 jobs and resulted in $20 million in capital investment.  There was just one problem: There was no Texas Energy Center to be found. Here, from the 2013 article in the New Republic, is what I discovered:  The address listed on its tax forms is the address of the Fort Bend Economic Development Council, inside the Fluor tower. I arrived there late one Friday morning and asked for the Texas Energy Center. The secretary said: \"Oh, it's not here. It's across the street. But there's nothing there now. Jeff handles it here.\" Jeff Wiley, the council's president, would be out playing golf the rest of the day, she said. I went to the building across the street and asked for directions from an aide in the office of DeLay's successor, which happened to be in the same building. She had not heard of the Texas Energy Center. But then I found its former haunt, a small vacant office space upstairs with a sign on an interior wallthe only mark of the center's brief existence. Later, I got Wiley on the phone. There has never been any $20 million investment, he said. The center survives only on paper, sustained by Wiley, who, for a cut of the $3.6 million, has filed the center's tax forms and kept a tally of the jobs that have been \"created\" by the state's money at local energy companies. I asked him how this workedhow, for instance, was the Texas Energy Center responsible for the 600 jobs attributed to EMS Pipeline Services, a company spun off from the rubble of Enron? Wiley said he would have to check the paperwork to see what had been reported to the state. He called back and said that the man who helped launch EMS had been one of the few people originally on staff at the Texas Energy Center, which Wiley said justified claiming the 600 jobs for the barely existing center. In at least one instance, this charade went too far: In 2006, a Sugar Land city official protested to Wiley that, while it was one thing to quietly claim the job totals from a Bechtel venture in town, it was not \"appropriate or honest\" to assert in a press release that the Texas Energy Center had played a role. \"There is a clear difference between qualifying jobs to meet the [Energy Center's] contractual requirement with the state and actively seeking to create a perception of [it] as an active, successful, going concern,\" wrote the official, according to Fort Bend Now, a local news website. In this case, reality prevailed, and Wiley declined to count the Bechtel jobs.  There was just one problem: There was no Texas Energy Center to be found.  Today, the $20 million in capital investment from the Texas Energy Center has vanished from the state's official accounting of Enterprise Fund impact, but the 1,500 jobs remain, part of the nearly 70,000 jobs that the state claims the fund has generated.  Drew Maloney, the former DeLay chief of staff who lobbied for federal funds for the Texas Energy Center, is now the vice president of government and external affairs at the energy giant Hess Corporation.  And Perry is on the verge of being put in charge of vastly larger sums of taxpayer dollars to disburse across the energy industry. (Requests for comment from the Trump transition team went unanswered, as did a request to Jeff Miller, an unofficial Perry spokesman who now works for Ryan, a Dallas-based tax consultancy that helps clients, including ExxonMobil, get tax incentives from Texas and other states.) The Department of Energy has a budget of around $30 billion, oversees a $4.5 billion loan guarantee program for energy companies, and distributes more than $5 billion in discretionary funds for clean-energy research and development. (The loan guarantee program was the source of the $535 million loan that solar-panel maker Solyndra defaulted on in 2011, but it has had plenty of successes as well.) Many of the department's programs have well-established standards for disbursement, but as secretary, Perry would have a say over at least some of the flow of dollars.  Trump himself, in announcing his nomination of Perry, said he hoped Perry would bring his Texas strategies on energy and economic development to Washington. \"As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state,\" Trump said, \"and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy.\"", "date": "2017/01/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/rick-perry-texas-energy-grants", "title": "19 Billion Reasons Why Rick Perry Can't Wait to Give Your Money to Energy Companies"}, {"text": "Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch appearing for the first time with President Donald Trump  During his confirmation hearings, scheduled to begin March 20, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch will face a thorough grilling about his legal philosophy. Among the topics likely to come up are his views on \"natural law\" and his relationship with John Finnis, the Oxford University professor who advised Gorsuch on his Ph.D. thesis and one the world's leading proponents of this arcane legal theory.  Natural law is a loosely defined term, but to many of its conservative US adherents it is essentially seen as God's lawa set of moral absolutes underpinning society itself. In recent years, natural law believers have invoked this legal theory to defend a range of anti-gay policies.  Natural law has been a source of controversy for at least two previous Supreme Court nominees in recent decadesfor dramatically different reasons. In 1991, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas because he would be the \"first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to maintain that natural law should be readily consulted in constitutional interpretation.\" Reagan nominee Robert Bork, on the other hand, was criticized for not believing in natural law by then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), no less. Biden told Bork at his confirmation hearing, \"As a child of God, I believe my rights are not derived from the Constitution_They were given to me and each of my fellow citizens by our creator.\"  Bork, who was ultimately rejected by the Senate, had scoffed at the idea that judges could know God's law and implement it. Later, in a 1992 essay, he warned that if natural law proponents \"persuade judges that natural law is their domain, the theorists will find that they have merely given judges rein to lay down their own moral and political predilections as the law of the Constitution. Once that happens, the moral reasoning of the rest of us is made irrelevant.\"  Natural law theory dates back to Thomas Aquinas and the Greeks before him. It isn't necessarily liberal or conservative. Lawyers from the natural-law legal camp helped formulate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, a seminal document in which 48 countries committed to pursuing progressive measures that would protect human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In the United States, natural law has taken on a variety of interpretations. One proponent was David Lane, a white supremacist implicated in the murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish radio talk show host in Gorsuch's hometown of Denver. Lane's followers gunned down Berg in his driveway in 1984. Lane, who died in 2007, claimed that natural law justified any act, however heinous, that preserved the perpetuation of a racein his case, the white race.  American conservatives, including Justice Thomas, use the term \"natural law\" to suggest that the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were divinely inspired. Former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), now the president of the conservative Heritage Institute think tank, explained in an essay last summer, \"Our rights as Americans are considered unalienable only because they were inherent in the natural order of life established by the laws of nature and nature's God.\"  Where does Gorsuch fit into all this? In the 1990s, he studied legal philosophy at Oxford under Finnis. Gorsuch, who received his doctorate in 2004, has remained close to his former mentor, whom he credits in the 2006 book that grew out of his Oxford thesis, The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. In a 2011 speech at Notre Dame law school honoring the Australian-born academic, Gorsuch fondly recalled the \"red ink he poured so carefullyand generouslyover the papers we produced.\" He declared, \"I have encountered few such patient, kind and generous teachers in my life.\" (Finnis did not respond for a request for comment. He has publicly declined to discuss Gorsuch, telling the Guardian earlier this month, \"I have resolved not to say anything to anyone at all.\")  Finnis, who is 76, is considered a brilliant and influential legal philosopher. In 1980, he published a definitive text on natural-law legal theory, Natural Law and Natural Rights, in which he identified seven \"basic goods\" that are central to human well-being: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability of friendship, practical reasonableness, and religion. From there, he sought to outline an ethical framework for viewing law and justice. He believes all human life is innately valuable and intrinsically good, and not because it might be useful to others, as some utilitarian philosophers might argue.  Melissa Moschella, an assistant professor of philosophy at the Catholic University of America who knows Finnis, says natural law is \"a theory about what's right and wrong, and it's based on what, through reason, we can know about what's good and bad for human beings, so that we act in ways that are always respectful of the well being of ourselves and others.\"  On many levels, Finnis' philosophy is profoundly humane. It led him to oppose the death penalty and to become an outspoken advocate for nuclear disarmament in the 1980s. He believed that even threatening to use nuclear weapons was immoral because it indicated a willingness to kill innocent civilians indiscriminately. Natural law also made him a foe of abortion and assisted suicide. While his work doesn't invoke the divine, as DeMint and others have, Finnis' views square with his Catholic faith: He converted to Catholicism in 1962 and has advised the Vatican on Catholic social teaching.  Not long after his conversion, Finnis discovered Germain Grisez, a French American natural-law philosopher and a prominent defender of the Church's opposition to contraception. Griesz and Finnis began to collaborate, and Finnis' work grew both more conservative and more focused on sex, particularly gay sex.  In 1993, Finnis testified for the state of Colorado in a case challenging Amendment 2, a ballot initiative that would have banned local governments from passing human rights ordinances or other anti-discrimination laws that would protect LGBT people. State Solicitor General Timothy Tymkovich, who now serves alongside Gorsuch on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, brought Finnis in to explain the allegedly classical roots of anti-gay prohibitions going back to Socrates. In his trial testimony, Finnis compared gay sex to bestiality \"because it is divorced from the expressing of an intelligible common good,\" according to part of his deposition published by The New Republic.  Martha Nussbaum, a prominent professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago, served as an expert for the other side, suggesting that Finnis was misinterpreting the Greeks, who clearly had some acceptance of homosexuality in their culture. Nussbaum's side ultimately prevailed at trial and at the US Supreme Court in its landmark decision in Romer v. Evans.  Nussbaum says Finnis \"is a very fine moral philosopher\" and \"author of important books that I admire.\" But she notes that his work on sexual orientation has less going for it. \"Finnis's book Natural Law and Natural Rights is entirely different from the 'new natural law' work inspired by Germain Grisez that he got into later,\" Nussbaum writes in an email. \"The former is excellent philosophy, the latter arcane and strange conservative argument. In England Finnis on the whole focused on philosophy, and people were shocked by some of the things he published beginning in 1994.\"  That year, he authored an article titled \"Law, Morality, and 'Sexual Orientation.'\" In it, Finnis insisted that \"homosexual orientation\" was a \"deliberate willingness to promote and engage in homosexual actsa state of mind, will, and character whose self-interpretation came to be expressed in the deplorable but helpfully revealing name 'gay.'\"  Finnis' students have deployed his legal theories to battle same-sex marriage in the United States. Among his best-known acolytes is Princeton professor Robert George, who co-founded the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage. George filed a brief in the 2013 Supreme Court case over the same-sex marriage ballot initiative in California, Proposition 8, and he also testified for the state of Colorado in the 1993 anti-discrimination case along with his former teacher.  Gorsuch's long relationship with Finnis has put him in close company with George and other anti-gay figures. When Gorsuch spoke at Notre Dame in 2011, he shared the stage with anti-gay theorists including George and Germain Grisez. Gorsuch has also worked with George on academic projects, including his tome on assisted suicide, which was part of a series of books George edited at Princeton University Press. George recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post supporting Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination.  Whether Gorsuch adheres to the same natural law philosophy as George and Finnis about the alleged societal harm of homosexuality is hard to know. His book on assisted suicide mentions Supreme Court cases involving gay rights, but only as reference points for analyzing the court's thinking, not his own, and its relevance to euthanasia. He's hired openly gay clerks and attends a liberal Episcopal church in very liberal Boulder, Colorado, and gay friends attested to his openness in a recent New York Times story.  But he also voted in favor of Hobby Lobby, the craft store whose owners sued the Obama administration, alleging that the company's religious freedom rights were violated by the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers contraception. That decision might square with a natural-law view respecting the exercise of religion as a critical human right, but it also may have led to more persecution of LGBT people. The Supreme Court decision upholding that ruling has since been used to defend businesses that have discriminated against LGBT peoplea view some lower courts have upheld. The Hobby Lobby case was brought by the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, a religious nonprofit law firm on whose board George serves.  Catholic University's Moschella says Finnis makes a distinction in his work between morality and the law. He believes that what a judge does on the bench is not determined by natural law but rather by the laws of that nation. So if Gorsuch really does endorse Finnis' philosophy, Moschella says, his moral views on abortion, gay rights, and other hot-button issues and what natural law says about them is irrelevant. She says, \"What is relevant to his work as a judge is his commitment, which is also a moral commitment, to upholding the law of the land.\"", "date": "2017/02/21", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/supreme-court-nominee-neil-gorsuch-was-student-natural-law", "title": "Does Donald Trump's Supreme Court Nominee Believe the Constitution Is God's Law?"}, {"text": "First lady Melania Trump on the campaign trail in November  On November 3, Melania Trump gave a rare speech on the campaign trail for her husband, Donald. At the end of the speech, she made an announcement: If her husband were elected, she would focus on combating cyberbullying from the White House. \"We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other,\" she said. \"We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media. It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I'm privileged enough to become your first lady.\"  The announcement was met with derision by people who noted that her husband was perhaps the world's most prominent cyberbully. Lady Gaga tweeted at Melania directly:  .@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for \"anti-bullying\" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed.  xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016  Three months later, Melania Trump is indeed first lady. But what of her pledge to take up cyberbullying? Mother Jones contacted a wide range of organizations and individuals who work on cyberbullying, and not a single one of them reported being contacted by Trump or anyone in the Donald Trump administration.  \"No one has reached out to us as of yet,\" says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor at Florida Atlantic University. \"People are posting unsolicited editorials in our space, asking Melania to do this or do that in an open letter on various sites, but her and her team have not reached out to us or anyone we know. And it's a pretty small circle of experts, so you'd think we'd have heard by now.\"  Not even Monica Lewinsky, who broke a decade of public silence in 2014 to become an anti-bullying advocate, has heard from the new first lady. Lewinsky might seem an obvious partner for Melania, given her history with President Trump's campaign opponent. Lewinsky has even spoken up to defend Melania and Donald Trump's son, 10-year-old Barron, from social-media trolls. But no one in the Trump administration has reached out to Lewinsky, according to someone who works with her on the issue. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Melania Trump's cyberbullying campaign seemed ill-fated from the start. Over the past 20 years, anti-bullying efforts have largely been driven by advocates for LGBT youth, who are disproportionately represented among victims of bullying. The role of LGBT groups in anti-bullying campaigns has resulted in a widespread backlash against these campaigns among right-wing evangelicals, a large voting bloc that supported Donald Trump in the election. Religious right advocates see efforts to combat bullying as another way of spreading the \"homosexual agenda.\"  In 2009, President Barack Obama tapped Kevin Jennings to become the \"anti-bullying czar\" at the Department of Education. Jennings is a former teacher who founded one of the first efforts to reduce bullying against LGBT kids, called the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). When Obama appointed him, Fox News and other conservative groups viciously attacked Jennings, claiming that he had condoned child molestation and spent his career teaching children how to perform sexual acts. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group that has supported Trump, launched a \"Stop Kevin Jennings\" campaign. Among those who joined was Mike Pence, then a congressman from Indiana and now vice president. He was one of more than 50 House Republicans who wrote to Obama demanding that Jennings be removed from the post, claiming that \"Mr. Jennings has played an integral role in promoting homosexuality and pushing a pro-homosexual agenda in America's schools.\"  Right-wing evangelicals see efforts to combat bullying as just another way of spreading the \"homosexual agenda.\"  Given the religious right's hostility to anti-bullying efforts, it's not clear who might help the new first lady promote her cause. One of the most prominent anti-bullying advocates is Lady Gaga, who started the Born This Way Foundation. Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, serves on the board of Born This Way. She says that neither she nor the singer has heard from the first lady.  Several advocates in the anti-bullying community say they would be eager to work with Melania Trump. \"I certainly would, as I do not want us to go backward or lose any momentum that we have gained in the last two decades,\" says Dorothy Espelage, a psychology professor at the University of Florida and a prominent anti-bullying crusader.  But it's unlikely that the White House will encourage Trump to forge a prominent alliance with any group that recognizes the unique issues faced by LGBT youth. \"It is hard to know what Melania is even thinking or who is advising her,\" Espelage says. \"I wonder myself the extent to which she will take the 'gendered' lens, which is really needed to prevent bullying as a precursor to sexual harassment, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence.\"  If Trump doesn't work with LGBT groups on the issue, who can she work with? Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, the founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York, has reached out to the first lady and offered the resources of her organization, which uses scientific research to combat cyberbullying. \"I think we can do this in an apolitical way,\" she says hopefully, though Trump hasn't responded to her.  Perhaps the most likely candidate to help Trump is Donna Rice Hughes. People of a certain age will remember the National Enquirer cover photo of Rice sitting on the lap of Democrat Gary Hart, whose 1988 presidential campaign she helped tank. Since her days of traveling to Bimini with Hart on his Monkey Business yacht, Rice Hughes has found God. She has spent the last two decades working at Enough Is Enough, a religious nonprofit focused on combating internet pornography, child exploitation, and, to a lesser extent, cyberbullying.  Rice Hughes endorsed Donald Trump during the campaign, and he was the only presidential candidate to sign her organization's pledge to aggressively enforce federal laws to prevent the sexual exploitation of children if elected. After Trump won, Rice Hughes issued a statement saying, \"We applaud our next First Lady Melania Trump's commitment to make cyberbullying her cause while in the White House, and look forward to supporting Mrs. Trump's efforts to be an agent of change for Internet safety and responsibility.\"  But even Rice Hughes seems to be getting stiffed. When I contacted her last month, a spokeswoman wouldn't say whether Rice Hughes had been approach by the Trumps or the administration, only that \"she stands ready to help.\" And so far, Melania Trump has sent no signalsto the public or the anti-bullying communitythat she is serious about the pre-election promise she made.", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/whatever-happened-melania-trumps-anti-cyberbullying-campaign", "title": "Whatever Happened to Melania Trump's Anti-Cyberbullying Campaign?"}, {"text": "Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President Trump's nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  During Tom Price's confirmation hearing last week, Sen. Orrin Hatch quizzed him on his commitment to eradicating Medicare fraud, which the Utah Republican noted had cost the government billions of dollars. If confirmed to head the US Department of Health and Human Services, Price, a Republican congressman from Georgia, will oversee the agency's efforts to protect government-run health care programs from scammers. \"I think they're a minority,\" Price replied, \"but there's some bad actors out there_If we were to focus on those individuals that were the bad actors specifically, then I think we could do a much better job of not just identifying the fraud that exists out there, but ending that fraud.\"  Those bad actors aren't as rare as Price suggested. In fact, a company closely linked to his medical practice was ensnared in a multimillion-dollar Medicare fraud case. In 1999, Price became a partner in Resurgens PC, what is now Georgia's largest orthopedic practice, where he also served as a board member until 2004, when he ran for Congress. Resurgens doctors performed surgeries at an outpatient facility that had been incorporated as a separate corporate entity, Resurgens Surgery Center LLC. In 2005, the surgery center agreed to repay $2.5 million to the federal government to settle allegations that it had fraudulently billed Medicare and Medicaid and violated a federal anti-kickback law.  Price was not implicated in the casethe wrongdoing allegedly occurred between 1993 and 1997, before he joined the practiceand he didn't hold a direct financial stake in Resurgens Surgery Center. But the payout by Resurgens Surgery Center highlights one of the conflicts he may face if his nomination is approved. As HHS secretary, he will be charged with helping enforce the very laws the Justice Department accused Resurgens Surgery Center of violating. A spokeswoman for Price did not respond to questions from Mother Jones.  There are other reasons to question how aggressively Price will go after Medicare scammers. He was a longtime member of a conservative medical organization, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, that has strongly opposed fraud investigations by HHS, claiming that \"misguided enforcement actions\" target honest physicians.  \"It's worth wondering how tough [Price is] going to be on these issues,\" says Marc Smolonsky, a former associate deputy secretary at HHS during the Obama administration and an expert on health care fraud. \"I'm not saying he's not going to be tough, but it's certainly something to ask.\" He notes that Congress earmarks almost $1.5 billion a year for HHS to probe fraud. \"Most of that is under his purview.\"  The case against Resurgens Surgery Center began in 2001, when a whistleblower named Robert Allen filed a federal False Claims Act lawsuit against the company in a Georgia federal court. Between 1995 and 1997, Allen had been a consultant and then an administrator for a group of anesthesiologists who worked closely with Resurgens Surgery Center. Allen alleged that the anesthesiologists had colluded with Resurgens Surgery Center to illegally collect \"facility fees\" from Medicare and Medicaid for services they performed in a Resurgens facility. The government health care programs allows certain health care providers, such as hospitals or outpatient surgery centers, to bill extra fees to help cover the overhead of running the facility on top of those charged for medical care.  But to claim such facility fees legally, federal regulations require a health care facility to have a certificate of need and a government-issued billing number. Resurgens Surgery Center had the right paperwork, but the suit alleged it covered only orthopedic services, not pain management or anesthesia. The anesthesiologists named in the whistleblower suit allegedly had neither a billing number nor a certificate of need. In fact, federal rules specifically bar anesthesiologists from collecting facility fees from Medicare. So, Allen's suit alleged, the anesthesiologists and Resurgens Surgery Center set up a lucrative but illegal arrangement. The anesthesiologists would provide pain treatments to their patients at the Resurgens facility and use its billing number to charge the federal government for use of the premises. In return, the anesthesiologists allegedly kicked back a portion of the facility fees to Resurgens Surgery Center.  Allen claimed this arrangement began in 1993 and continued after he left the anesthesiologists' practice in 1997. And he alleged that he told the doctors their setup was illegal but they declined to put an end to it.  The Department of Justice can intervene in private whistleblower suits if it believes serious misconduct has occurred. In 2002, it did so in Allen's case. In 2004, the anesthesiologists settled for $1.3 million. The following year, shortly after Price was elected to Congress, Resurgens Surgery Center also settled, agreeing to repay $2.5 million in fees it had billed the government. Neither Resurgens Surgery Center nor the anesthesiologists admitted to wrongdoing in the settlement.  Doug Lundy, co-president of Resurgens PC, did not respond to requests for comment. But after the 2005 settlement was announced, Charles C. Murphy, an attorney for Resurgens Surgery Center, told a local Georgia newspaper that the company made a \"business decision\" to settle the case. \"The Resurgens doctors believed they had done nothing improper,\" he said. \"Nonetheless, the case was becoming a significant distraction, and Resurgens Surgery Center believes the more prudent course was to put the matter behind it.\"  Since Price entered Congress, his former Resurgens colleagues and other company employees have been major backers of his campaigns, donating nearly $225,000 since 2004. In July 2015, Lundy hosted a fundraiser for Price. After Price was nominated to HHS, Resurgens issued a statement congratulating Price. (The statement was subsequently removed from the company's website.) A full vote by the Senate on his nomination is expected next week.  The Obama administration made a big push to crack down on Medicare billing fraud, which is believed to sap nearly $100 billion a year from Medicare and Medicaid. It aggressively rooted out crooked doctors and hospitals that were bilking the system, and it included tougher anti-fraud rules in the Affordable Care Act. In June, HHS and the Department of Justice spearheaded the largest Medicare fraud takedown in history. The investigation resulted in charges against more than 300 people and involved nearly $1 billion in fraudulent billing. Sixty-one of the people charged were doctors.  Will a Secretary Price continue to pursue this kind of aggressive enforcement? Dr. Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute and a former member of the government's Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, is skeptical. \"He clearly thinks doctors should be left alone,\" Berenson says. \"[Billing fraud] is the kind of thing that happens when they are left alone.\"", "date": "2017/02/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/tom-price-resurgens-surgery-center-medicare-fraud-settlement", "title": "A Company Closely Linked to Tom Price's Medical Practice Paid a Big Medicare Fraud Settlement"}, {"text": "The silver fox wins. Supreme Court watchers had been speculating for days that President Donald Trump would nominate a justice who most looks like he could play one on TV. Of all the conservative candidates on Trump's short list, 10th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch most fit that bill.  The administration rolled out the president's Supreme Court pick Tuesday evening with dramatic flair more appropriate for a reality TV series. Trump summoned his two top picks, Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman, who serves alongside Trump's sister on the 3rd Circuit of Appeals, to heighten the suspense. And he unveiled his selection during a prime-time Oval Office address.  \"The qualifications of Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute,\" he declared in making the announcement, noting that Gorsuch had been confirmed unanimously to his current seat. \"That's unanimouscan you believe that? Nowadays with what's going on? Does that happen anymore?\"  After Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Republicans refused to allow President Barack Obama to fill his seat on the high courtObama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, didn't even receive a hearing. That gamble appears to have paid off. Gorsuch is seen by many on the right as a fitting heir to Scalia. Appointed to the 10th Circuit by President George W. Bush in 2006, Gorsuchlike Scaliais a so-called \"textualist,\" meaning he looks only to the words on the page, and not to legislative history when looking at the law. He's expected to hew to Scalia's approach of interpreting the law through the lens of the Founders' original intent. Unlike Hardiman, whose blue-collar background and years driving a taxi gave him a compelling and unusual personal story for a potential Supreme Court justice, Gorsuch has an Ivy League background. He was in Obama's class at Harvard Law School, studied philosophy at Oxford, and served in the Bush Justice Department. (In his announcement, Trump noted that \"education is very, very important to me.\")  Now Gorsuch could serve alongside Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he once clerked. But Gorsuch's views on the lawand especially the power of the regulatory statemay have been shaped as much by his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, who was the first woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency. During her brief tenure as President Ronald Reagan's EPA administrator, Burford waged war on environmental regulations, including trying to roll back limits on lead in gasoline. She became the first agency head in American history to be held in contempt of Congress for withholding documents from the House, which was investigating mismanagement of a Superfund cleanup project. Burford had previously served in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of the \"House Crazies,\" a group of legislators who might have been considered the Tea Party Caucus of their day.  As a federal appellate judge, Neil Gorsuch won conservative fans with his rulings in cases involving Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor, in which he rejected the Obama administration's attempt to force both entities to provide contraception coverage in their health insurance plans. He also recently dissented in a decision by his court to deny the rehearing of an appeal from the state of Utah, which had tried to defund Planned Parenthood but was blocked by the appellate court.  Despite Gorsuch's extremely conservative record on the bench, anti-abortion purists had been lobbying against his nomination because they considered him insufficiently pro-life. But other abortion foes, such as Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ed Whelan, have countered that Gorsuch is clearly on record as pro-life. He wrote a book on assisted suicide, and in that book he made clear that he didn't see a constitutional rationale for placing the value of a mother's life over that of her unborn childa clear enough signal about his views on Roe v. Wade, the controversial Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.  With Gorsuch's nomination, Trump seems to have fulfilled one of his primary campaign promises of appointing a pro-life justice to fill Scalia's seat. As he said before announcing his pick, \"Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for president for me. I am a man of my word.\"  Whether Gorsuch will live up to Trump's promise to overturn Roe v. Wade \"automatically\" remains to be seen. In 2005, Gorsuch wrote an essay for National Review decrying the increasing politicization of the judiciary, which, he wrote, \"undermines the only real asset it hasits independence.\" Gorsuch added, \"Judges come to be seen as politicians and their confirmations become just another avenue of political warfare.\" Gorsuch may prove to have an independent streak to match the justice he'll be replacing (or simply a fondness for opining in conservative news outlets like his future colleague Samuel Alito). Regardless, at 49, he will be the youngest justice on the court since the first President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, who was 42 at the time. Actuarial tables suggest Gorsuch will have many, many years on the court to make good on Trump's pledge.", "date": "2017/01/31", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-picks-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court", "title": "Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court"}, {"text": "10th Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman, one of the candidates on President Trump's Supreme Court short list  President Donald Trump said on Monday that he will announce his Supreme Court during prime time on Tuesday night. He has reportedly narrowed his choices to three candidates, down from 21 potential nominees he identified during the presidential campaign.  But with Trump, there's always the possibility of a big surprise. Assuming he doesn't go completely off script (Judge Judy?), here are the candidates he's likely considering.  William Pryor Jr.  A federal judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Pryor previously succeeded Jeff Sessions as Alabama's attorney general. Sessions, Trump's nominee for US attorney general, has been Pryor's top backer. Given Sessions' considerable influence within the administration, this makes Pryor a leading candidate for the court. But Pryor would face a particularly contentious confirmation hearing. He was filibustered for his first federal judicial appointment during the George W. Bush administration because of what critics called his extremist anti-gay views.  He hails from the Republican camp that believes Americans should be liberated from government interference, except when it comes to their sex lives. He's vehemently opposed to abortion and called the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion the \"worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\" As Alabama attorney general, Pryor defended a ban on the sale of sex toys in the state, writing in a legal brief that \"the commerce in sexual stimulation and auto-eroticism, for its own sake, unrelated to marriage, procreation, or familial relations is an evil, an obscenity_detrimental to the health and morality of the state.\"  Pryor was an early favorite to fill the empty high court slot, but he seems to have fallen out of favor in the past few weeks. Despite his long record of rulings hostile to gay rights, anti-gay groups have recently opposed Pryor's potential nomination because he once ruled in favor of a transgender woman who was fired when she began her transition.  Thomas Hardiman  He comes with an endorsement from Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who serves with Hardiman on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. But when George W. Bush nominated Hardiman to a federal trial court in 2003, the American Bar Association gave him a lukewarm \"qualified\" rating.  Hardiman has a compelling personal story: He's the first member of his family to go to college, and he put himself through Georgetown law school driving a taxi. He speaks Spanish and volunteered to help undocumented immigrants in DC at the nonprofit legal clinic Ayuda. His wife, Lori Zappala, is part of a powerful Democratic family in Pittsburgh.  While those parts of his rsum might make Hardiman more moderate than some of Trump's other potential candidates, he isn't liberal by any stretch. Before joining the federal bench, Hardiman was active in the Pennsylvania GOP and represented the state party in a number of state political fights. In 2006, the late Sen. Arlen Specter described Hardiman as a \"protg\" of former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). Hardiman was one of several Bush appointees Salon identified as donating to Bush and other Republican politicians with influence on judicial nominations at the same time they were being considered for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.  In private practice, Hardiman represented communities looking to block low-income housing developments in their neighborhoods, and his history led Democratic senators to question his civil rights record when Bush elevated him to his current seat on the 10th Circuit in 2007. Hardiman doesn't seem to have ruled in an abortion case, so his views on that contentious issue are unclear. But he does appear to share Pryor's Puritanism. He once dissented in a 3rd Circuit case in which the court held that a school could not ban \"I  Boobies\" breast cancer awareness bracelets. Hardiman disagreed, fearing for the delicate sensibilities of middle-schoolers. He wrote, \"Many twelve-and thirteen-year-old children are susceptible to juvenile sexualization of messages that would be innocuous to a reasonable adult.\" Hardiman envisioned that the ruling could open the floodgates for more risqu slogans.  Neil Gorsuch  Many court watchers, noting Trump's \"central casting\" approach to staffing, consider the 10th Circuit judge the favorite for the high court seat, if for no other reason than \"he looks the part,\" as Empirical SCOTUS blogger Adam Feldman put it. David Lat, founder of legal affairs blog Above the Law, tweeted recently that Gorsuch seems like the obvious choice for Trump because \"we all know Trump cares about looks, & Neil 'Silver Fox' Gorsuch is taller & handsomer than (the already good-looking) Bill Pryor.\" Lat also noted, \"Judge Gorsuch is a 'winner'brilliant, pedigreed, tall, handsomeand Trump likes winners.\" Unlike Pryor and Hardiman, Gorsuch is also an Ivy Leaguer.  An Oxford and Harvard grad, Gorsuch, 49, is also one of the youngest sitting federal judges on Trump's lista selling point for a president looking to leave a lasting legacy on the court. He is a conservative in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and is considered an \"originalist\" who tries to interpret the law as the Founders would have. Also in his column: As one of the 10th Circuit judges who ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby against the Obama administrationexempting the company from federal requirements to provide employees with insurance plans that included free contraceptive coveragehis religious-right bona fides are solid.  But hard-core anti-abortion activists have been lobbying against Gorsuch and recently asked Trump to consider judges with a more proven record of anti-abortion advocacy from the bench. Andrew Schlafly, son of the late conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, recently sent out an alert to supporters arguing that Gorsuch is \"NOT pro-life\" because he wrote an opinion noting his obligation to follow court precedent. Schlafly sees adherence to precedent as a deal-breaker and a sign that a judge won't overturn Roe.  Pryor, Hardiman, and Gorsuch are the leading candidates for the Supreme Court job, but Trump is unpredictable. So maybe he'll go with bomb-thrower Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett, who calls himself Texas' most conservative justice. Willett sees very little role for the government in regulating health and safety issues. He once joined with the state court to strike down as unconstitutional training requirements for people who perform eyebrow threading, a hair removal procedure that can spread various diseases, including ringworm and pink eye.  A Reason columnist declared Willett's concurrence in the case \"easily one of the most libertarian legal decisions I've ever read.\" Willett wrote with outrage about the greater threat to liberty of regulating eyebrow plucking:  This case raises constitutional eyebrows because it asks building-block questions about constitutional architectureabout how we as Texans govern ourselves and about the relationship of the citizen to the State. This case concerns far more than whether Ashish Patel can pluck unwanted hair with a strand of thread. This case is fundamentally about the American Dream and the unalienable human right to pursue happiness without curtsying to government on bended knee.  As far as appearances go, Willett doesn't necessarily have the central-casting looks that seem so important to Trump. But he does have one quality Trump clearly appreciates: With more than 75,000 followers, Willett is really good on Twitter.", "date": "2017/01/31", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/here-are-top-contenders-trumps-supreme-court-pick", "title": "Meet the Top Contenders for Trump\u0089\u00db\u00aas Supreme Court Pick"}, {"text": "Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) at a tea party rally on Capitol Hill in 2010  Last week, the Senate Health Committee grilled Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), on his plan to dismantle Obamacare and his extensive trading in medical stocks. But when senators on the finance committee question him on Tuesday before voting on his nomination, they might want to ask about a line in his rsum that suggests he poses a much broader threat to government regulation of health care. Price has long been a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a fringe medical group that is deeply opposed to any government role in regulating doctors.  AAPS got its start in the 1940s, with the help of members of the John Birch Society, the extreme right-wing group known for peddling outlandish conspiracy theories. It has fought the government over health care ever since. Its statement of principles declares it \"evil\" and \"immoral\" for doctors to participate in Medicaid and Medicare.  AAPS has been a vocal player in the anti-vaccine movement. Its medical journal has attacked immigrants as the source of disease outbreaks, including leprosy, and suggested that HIV doesn't cause AIDS but that abortion causes breast cancer. The scientific consensus rejects all these claims. AAPS was the primary source of rumors during the presidential campaign that Hillary Clinton was suffering from a major illness. It has opposed electronic medical records, calling them a form of \"data control\" like that used by the Stasi, the former East German secret police. Researchers estimate that medical errors kill more than 250,000 Americans a year, making them the third leading cause of death, but AAPS dismisses such reports as a bogus pretext for more government regulation of health care. AAPS was a prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, and Price appeared regularly at its protests and events, speaking out against the health reform bill.  Price has been listed as a member of AAPS as far back as 2009, when the group touted him as a member in a press release. Multiple news accounts last month stated that Price was an active member of the group. However, AAPS general counsel Andrew Schlafly could not confirm whether Price is still a member of the group, and Price's congressional office did not respond to a request for comment.  As HHS secretary, Price would be in charge of multiple federal offices involved in improving health care safety, a job that includes oversight of the regulation of individual physicians. But AAPS has opposed a wide range of government measures to hold individual doctors accountable, and even some private ones. It has fought to limit malpractice lawsuits and battled proposals to require board-certified specialists to recertify every 10 years to ensure their scientific knowledge is current. It has worked to strip disciplinary power from state medical boards and even gotten involved in lawsuits to weaken federal protections for the peer review process, in which doctors vet their colleagues.  \"I think that Dr. Price has the potential to cripple the delivery system reform that is making patients safer and giving them better care every day,\" says Michael Millenson, an adjunct professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine who consults with the health care industry on reducing medical errors.  AAPS has suggested that HIV doesn't cause AIDS but that abortion causes breast cancer. It was the primary source of rumors that Hillary Clinton was suffering from a major illness.  AAPS, though, is thrilled with his nomination. \"The hope is that Tom Price will try to steer HHS in the right direction,\" says Schlafly, the son of the late anti-feminist icon Phyllis Schlafly. \"We were glad he got picked. We support him. We like him. He's a good guy.\"  AAPS has long been a bad doctor's best friend. Over the years, it has waged concerted campaigns to protect doctors accused of misconduct.  In 2007, AAPS sued the Texas medical board when it tried to discipline some physicians for particularly egregious misconduct, including one doctor the board believed was injecting patients with jet fuel and formaldehyde as part of his \"chemical sensitivity\" treatments. (The doctor later explained that he was merely injecting patients with the \"electromagnetic imprint\" of carcinogens as part of his homeopathic treatments and was eventually allowed to keep his license, with some restrictions.) After six years of litigation, AAPS ultimately lost its lawsuit against the medical board. But in 2011, the group succeeded in persuading the Texas Legislature to strip the board of much of its power.  AAPS has defended doctors criminally charged with drug trafficking for overprescribing pain medication, a key factor in the opioid epidemic. One of those doctors, William Hurwitz, was alleged to have prescribed one patient 1,600 pain pills in a day. One of his patients allegedly died of an overdose after he prescribed her massive doses of morphine. After Hurwitz was sentenced to prison for 25 years, AAPS filed a brief as part of his appeal. (He was eventually retried and sentenced to just under five years.) In 2009, Price headlined the AAPS annual meeting where the conference materials included a poem Hurwitz wrote from prison.  The group championed Parvaz Dara, a New Jersey oncologist whose medical license was revoked in 2011 after his unsanitary medical practice infected at least 29 cancer patients with hepatitis B. AAPS issued press releases decrying Dara's persecution, published his writing in its medical journal, and invited him to speak at its conferences. (The New Jersey medical board restored his license in 2014, with some restrictions.)  Schlafly says AAPS gets involved \"when there's an unfair action against a doctor for exercising his independent judgment.\" He adds, \"We're more about standing out against government, against big hospital systems, against big insurance companies. There's a libertarian streak in our organizations.\"  AAPS is so opposed to any questioning of doctors that it's fought peer review, the process used by doctors to evaluate each other's work. Peer review is sacrosanct in medicine, and it's enshrined in a federal law that protects doctors from lawsuits by other doctors to encourage them to participate in the process. AAPS has filed legal briefs in support of doctors who, after peer review, were denied hospital privileges because of their poor care and threat to patients; the group frequently argues in these cases in favor of making it easier for doctors to sue colleagues who blow the whistle on them.  Price has long supported the crusade against malpractice lawsuits. In Congress, he has advocated federal limits on malpractice suits, and his proposed Obamacare replacement legislation would restrict suits against doctors. But even without legislation, Price would have tremendous power as HHS secretary over how the government regulates doctors. For instance, he would oversee a national database aimed at preventing dangerous doctors from moving across state lines and continuing to practice. \"Boy, our members dislike that National Practitioners Data Bank,\" says Schlafly, who wants to limit hospitals' ability to report disciplinary action to the database.  In 2011, Price introduced legislation to do just that. It didn't pass, but he'll have the ability to undermine the database at HHS. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently found that hospitals and medical boards routinely evade database reporting requirements, allowing many doctors accused of sexual assault to keep practicing. HHS could crack down on this problem, but Price seems more likely to weaken the reporting requirements than to enforce them.  AAPS' opposition to federal efforts to improve health care extends beyond regulation of doctors. It has opposed federal funding for comparative effectiveness research to figure out, for instance, whether spine surgery is better than physical therapy for most back pain. (It's not.) There's little private support for such research because it threatens the health care industry's bottom line, so it relies on federal funds. AAPS sees this sort of work as a gateway to government-rationed health care. That's because the research could be used to end Medicare payments for ineffective care, such as lucrative but unnecessary spine surgeries or useless but expensive drugs. The group believes doctors should have the ultimate authority over all treatment decisions. Price apparently does, too. One of the many bills he sponsored to overturn Obamacare included language that would have banned comparative effectiveness research from being used to deny coverage for a treatment or procedure in a government health care plan. The bill would also have restricted the publication of the results of such researchpotentially leaving the public in the dark about medical choices.  Patient safety advocates are particularly concerned that much of Price's work as health secretary to advance AAPS' agenda could occur out of the public view. \"This is someone who belongs to a group that has singled out functions that protect the public that the public doesn't even know exists,\" says Millenson. \"You're talking about someone with a detailed agenda, and a detailed agenda to mess things up. If that doesn't worry you, I'd like to know why.\"", "date": "2017/01/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/tom-price-health-secretary-fringe-medical-group", "title": "Trump's Health Secretary Pick Tied to Fringe Medical Group That Defends Doctors Accused of Misconduct"}, {"text": "President-elect Donald Trump at the funeral of Phyllis Schlafly, with her son, anti-abortion activist Andrew Schlafly  During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to nominate pro-life Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade \"automatically,\" and he released a list of 21 candidates he would consider for a spot on the high court. The conservative legal organization the Federalist Society, as well as the Heritage Foundation, an influential right-wing think tank, helped draft the list. But since the election, some pro-life activists have been pushing the Trump team to jettison most of the people on his short list on the grounds that they aren't sufficiently committed to overturning the landmark 1973 abortion ruling.  In mid-December, Andrew Schlafly, president of the Legal Center for the Defense of Life and son of the late anti-feminist icon Phyllis Schlafly, wrote an open letter to Trump, signed by more than 70 anti-abortion activists, urging him to appoint a Supreme Court justice with a \"proven pro-life record.\" In a not-so-subtle reminder that pro-life voters may have played a huge role in putting Trump in the White House despite his obvious moral failings, Schlafly wrote:  Exit polls in the election showed that 21% of voters felt that this issue of the Supreme Court was 'the most important factor' in determining for whom they voted. Among that group of voters, you defeated your opponent by a landslide of 15%, 56-41%.  \"I'm worried that Trump's advisers will pull a Souter,\" Schlafly explains, referring to President George H.W. Bush's nomination of Justice David Souter. Souter was something of a blank slate when he was nominated, and he proved to be far more liberal than Republicans had believed. When it comes to the Supreme Court, Schlafly and his supporters don't want to leave anything to chance, which means a nominee who doesn't just profess pro-life convictions, but has a documented track record of ruling in abortion cases. But Schlafly suspects some of the people advising Trump on a court pick want \"a stealth candidate, someone without a record,\" who would generate less opposition in a confirmation hearing.  Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the federal bench by George W. Bush, won't be pro-life on the bench...because he doesn't invoke the term \"unborn child\" in his decisions or public comments.  Among those he's singled out for supposedly pushing such a candidate is Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Societywhich Schlafly insists is \"not a pro-life organization,\" despite Leos stated opposition to abortion. (Leo did not respond to a request for comment.)  Among those whom Schlafly has targeted on Trump's short list are some pretty stalwart conservative federal judges, including Diane Sykes, a 7th Circuit judge who reportedly ranks as one of Trump's top two choices. Schlafly believes Sykes is not pro-life because as a Wisconsin* state court judge she sentenced two anti-abortion protesters to 60 days in jail for a clinic protest. Later, on the federal bench, she also helped strike down a law defunding Planned Parenthoodanother black mark against her in his book. Another potential nominee, 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the federal bench by George W. Bush, won't be pro-life on the bench, according to Schlafly, because he doesn't invoke the term \"unborn child\" in his decisions or public comments.  Candidates who meet Schlafly's litmus test are few and far between, but there are two women from the highly conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas, Judges Edith Jones and Jennifer Elrod, who make the cut. Jones is a conservative poster gal who has been floated as a candidate for a GOP Supreme Court slot so many times that she's been dubbed the \"Susan Lucci\" of Supreme Court nominations, after the soap opera star who was nominated 18 times for an Emmy before finally winning. As Tim Noah explained in Slate in 2005, \"Presidents have been not choosing Jones since 1987,\" back when Ronald Reagan needed a Supreme Court nominee to replace Robert Bork, whom the Senate rejected as too much of an extremist.  Today, Jones' far-right views would make the late Bork look like a bleeding-heart liberal. In 2006, Jones made the Texas Observer's list of worst judges in the state for rulings such as the one that upheld the execution of a man whose lawyer slept through his trial. Her performance in a sexual-harassment case was also noteworthy. \"After hearing testimony that a woman had endured, among other things, a co-worker pinching her breast at work, Jones retorted, 'Well, he apologized,'\" wrote the Observer.  In 2014, lawyers and law students filed a judicial misconduct complaint against Jones over a speech she gave at a 2013 Federalist Society event. Jones allegedly said the death penalty provided a \"positive service\" to defendants because they are \"likely to make peace with God only in the moment before imminent execution.\" She also allegedly said, \"African Americans and Hispanics are predisposed to crime\" and \"prone to commit acts of violence.\" (Because there was no recording of Jones' remarks, the complaint against her was dismissed.)  But for anti-abortion activists, her record is stellar: She was part of a three-judge panel that upheld a 2012 mandatory sonogram law in Texas, forcing doctors to give women seeking an abortion medically unnecessary information designed to persuade them to change their minds. In 2014, she was on a panel of judges considering a challenge to a Texas abortion law that closed 22 abortion clinics in the state. During oral arguments, she told lawyers for the Texas clinics that the 300-mile round trip some women would have to endure to reach a clinic under the new law was no big deal if they drove fast. The road, she said, was flat.  Elrod, who is also on Schlafly's short list, wrote a circuit opinion in a preliminary phase of the case upholding that controversial law, which was struck down by the US Supreme Court last year in Women's Whole Health v. Hellerstedt. In her opinion, Elrod gave almost complete deference to the state's argument that the abortion-closing law was designed to protect women's health, despite having no evidence to support that claim. She wrote, \"In our circuit, we do not balance the wisdom or effectiveness of a law against the burdens the law imposes,\" suggesting that the difficulties women might face obtaining an abortion in Texas were not relevant to her deliberations.  Florida Supreme Court Chief Judge Charles Canady is one of Trump's potential candidates who meets with Schlafly's approval as well. Canady, as a member of Congress in 1995, coined the term \"partial-birth abortion\" when he sponsored legislation banning dilation and extraction abortions in which doctors removed an intact fetus after collapsing its skull to minimize health complications in the woman. As a state court judge, he blocked a young woman from getting an abortion without her parents' consent. His anti-abortion credentials are rock solid.  Schlafly complains that Trump's advisers, including the Federalist Society's Leo, are pushing him to tap younger judges while ignoring older, more proven judges such as Jones, who is 67, or Canady, 62. He wrote recently, \"Mr. Leo's approach runs afoul of conservative principles, which recognize that the longer someone is in D.C., the more liberal they generally get. That's apparently true for some think tank executives as well, by the way.\"  The anti-abortion movement as a whole has not gotten on board with Schlafly's campaign, largely because everyone on Trump's Supreme Court list is very conservative and likely to be hostile to abortion, even if they have not yet ruled on it. The signatories of Schlafly's letter to Trump are B-listers of the anti-choice movement. Many of them represent state chapters of his late mother's organization, the Eagle Forum, or the much-diminished Operation Rescue. But the most politically powerful anti-abortion groups such as Americans United for Life, National Right to Life, and the Family Research Council have not weighed in on his picks. Even anti-abortion stalwart Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, has shied away, despite being approached by Schlafly for support, saying that Schlafly's letter \"doesn't reflect my judgment on all of the candidates.\"  Ed Whelan, a former Scalia law clerk and attorney in the George W. Bush administration's Department of Justice, has been one of the most outspoken conservative critics of Schlafly's abortion purity campaign. He declined to comment for this story, but in his \"Bench Notes\" column in National Review, Whelan has explicitly defended potential Trump nominees from Schlafly's attacks. He points out, for instance, that Schlafly's own mother approved of the judges on Trump's list before she died. In her last book, The Conservative Case for Trump, she and her co-author wrote, \"It is to Trumps credit that his shortlist is as good as it is.\"  Schlafly's own mother approved of the judges on Trump's list before she died.  And he counters Schlafly's criticism of the 7th Circuit's Sykes by noting that while Sykes did rule in a case involving abortion protesters, \"she didn't sentence them for protesting abortion. She sentenced them for cementing their legs to the front of a car parked at the entrance to an abortion clinic and thus shutting down the clinic. What sentence does Schlafly believe Sykes should have imposed?\"  But Whelan's primary opposition to Schlafly's campaign is that he believes the anti-abortion purists \"want judges to indulge pro-life values to misread the law in order to reach pro-life results,\" something he argues Scalia would never have approved of. Schlafly dismisses Whelan's criticism as sour grapes: \"Ed Whelan was a strident opponent of Trump himself.\"  On Wednesday, during his first press conference since July, Trump said he would announce his Supreme Court choice during the first week or two after the inauguration. It's unclear whether he's taking Schlafly's input under advisement. Neither Trump nor his advisers have responded to Schlafly. But Schlafly notes that his letter was featured on Fox News, and he's hopeful it's making an impact. \"Nothing else a president does even compares to the significance of this decision,\" Schlafly says, noting that its ramifications could last 30 years or more. Yet he thinks when it comes to the potential justices, Trump's team hasn't done its homework on the abortion issue, and he's simply trying to fill in the research gaps. \"Everybody knows that's what's at stake,\" he says. \"A very thorough vetting process is in order.\"  Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the state court on which Sykes served. She was a state court judge in Wisconsin, not Indiana.", "date": "2017/01/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/anti-abortion-activists-reject-trump-high-court-picks", "title": "Anti-Abortion Activists Say Trump's Court Picks Aren't Extreme Enough"}, {"text": "Gavin Grimm at Bindle & Keep, a tailor shop in Brooklyn, in February  Early on a Sunday morning last month, I rode with Gavin Grimm, a transgender teen from Virginia, in the back of a New York taxi to Bindle & Keep tailor shop in Brooklyn. There, the 17-year-old high school senior would shed his baggy jeans and a gray hoodie for a new suit, which he planned to wear to the Supreme Court hearing of his landmark case on transgender rights.  The issue isn't just about bathrooms, Grimm and his lawyers argue, but about the right to exist in public space.  Looking out the window at the passing skyscrapers, Grimm remarked that he prefers big cities to his hometown in Virginia. Going to school in rural Gloucester can be a nightmare, he tells me: Because he's transgender, he's not allowed to use the boys' bathroom, so he has to walk to a private room near the nurse's office anytime he needs to pee. Grimm sued his school board in 2015, saying the policy violated federal civil rights law by discriminating against him on the basis of gender identity. His case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which has never before considered questions about transgender rights.  In an amicus brief for Grimm's case, parents wrote about how their trans children have been humiliated and stigmatized as a result of such policies at other schools. The issue isn't just about bathrooms, Grimm and his lawyers argue, but about the right to exist in public space. Without access to bathrooms, it's hard to sit through class, run errands, or hold a job.  At the tailor shop, about a month before the scheduled Supreme Court hearing, Grimm's mother, Deirdre, noted that the dark suit made her son seem more confidant. \"Now if we can just win,\" she said through tears, after thanking the tailors for their help. \"For all these kids and all these other moms.\"  But Grimm won't get a chance to wear the suit this month: On Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it would no longer hear the case. After the Trump administration gave schools across the country permission to block trans kids from bathrooms of their choice, the justices are sending it back to a lower court. It could be years before the high court takes up the question again. I caught up with Grimm at the tailor shop and again this week to hear what it's like going to school in Virginia and how he's taking the news from the Supreme Court.  Mother Jones: What's your town like, and what about your high school?  Gavin Grimm: The school is not tiny, but that's because it's the only one in the county. It's got a country-conservative vibe, teachers and students alike, but there are plenty of more open-minded students. [Gloucester] is more intensely conservative. You would not believe the amount of Trump signs I saw.  \"I really would like to sit down with someone who thinks it's appropriate for me to be in the girls' room and talk through that with them,\" Grimm says.  MJ: What do you do for fun?  GG: I pet my cat probably too much, and I dote over the [pet] pig probably too much, and then I just hang out with my friends. We hang out at someone's house or we go see a movie. We go to Walmart. That's the only thing to do around here.  MJ: When did you realize you were transgender?  GG: That's kind of a hard question, because it boils down to vocabulary. When was I first aware of the word? When I was like 12. When did I feel like I was a boy? I was like two. It was something that was more abstract to me as a kid. I have a twin brother, and I was like, \"On some level I feel like we are identical in our presentation, and like I'm no different from him.\" As a little kid I was allowed to just harass snakes and play with bugs and play with dirt, whateverI was just kind of allowed to be. But then the social aspects came in, like my dad would treat me like a girl, in a very old-fashioned way, which infuriated me. I didn't want to be called a princess or anything like that.  MJ: I heard you were shy when you were younger, though I totally don't get that vibe from you now. Has it been hard having a lot of attention on you because of the case?  GG: I was shy because I was bullied horrendously and I didn't really have any friends, so I was extremely insecure. I was really, really anxious all the time, and so interacting with people was extremely challenging for me, even people I knew, like family members. But once I transitioned and I was able to be myself, that radically changed. And as far as the attention, regardless of where I am now with my gregariousness, I am still not the kind of person that's like, \"Oh all the attention on me, yay, that's fun!\" This has been really hard to adjust to.  MJ: Not being able to use the boys' bathroomhow does that affect you?  GG: Well day to day, there's a practicality issue. I have to go to the nurse's room, which is farther away from my classes than any of the actual restrooms, so I have to take a ridiculous amount of class time. Not like eight hours, of course, but compared to the three minutes that it would take [to use the boys' room], it's unacceptable. And it's just very stigmatizing, and it's embarrassing. If I ever stay after school or go to any sporting function, where the only bathrooms are the ones outside, I don't have anywhere to go. Like I have to leave the campus to go to the bathroom.  \"I don't enjoy any aspect of school. Like I'm a very social person, but that climate is so uncomfortable for me, and I also don't have a friggin bathroom there, so that's a problem.\"  MJ: Some people say you should just use the girls' bathroom. Why can't you?  GG: I really would like to sit down with someone who thinks it's appropriate for me to be in the girls' room and talk through that with them. Like I don't think anyone wants me in there to begin with. It's funny because people say I'm definitely not allowed in the boys' room because I'm \"a girl.\" But then no one wants me in the girls' room either.  I can't go to the girls' room because I'm not a girl. It starts and ends there. It's a real simple concept.  MJ: Have other kids at the school been supportive of you?  GG: Some people treat me with this distance, or this \"ew,\" or they'll like whisper around me or whatever. Some people, like people I used to talk to and stuff, they don't speak to me anymore, but they're not necessarily malicious. And then there are people who are like, \"Hey, go you, you're great.\" So it's a really mixed bag.  MJ: What's your favorite part about school?  GG: Going home. I don't enjoy any aspect of school. Like I'm a very social person, but that climate is so uncomfortable for me, and I also don't have a friggin bathroom there, so that's a problem. I guess if I had to choose, I enjoy the moment in the morning before the bell rings where I just get to hang out with all my friends.  MJ: I heard you talking in the taxi about genetics. Do you have an interest in that for your career?  GG: I love science. What I would really like to do one day is start my own practice where I do family planning through genetics. A lot of people, if they have a devastating condition, they don't want to pass it on. I'd give people consultations about what might be best for their future, gene-wise.  MJ: Some people have called you a hero for the transgender community. Who are your heroes, or who do you look up to?  GG: I do have heroes, but then I always blank on this one. One person I can think of off the top of my head is Ellen DeGeneres. With me and my mom, it's kind of a family affair to watch her. Her love and care and just selflessness has always been so inspirational to me.  MJ: Since you're a senior now, you might graduate before you get a resolution in your case. Does that mean it won't affect you?  GG: I have some underclassmen friends, and if I were to ever go back to a football game or go to a function or whatever, I would still be barred from the restroom, so it does affect me in that way. But you're right in saying it primarily is not going to affect me. So my focus right now is on my trans friends that still go to that school or just anyone who might come after me that's trans going to that school, or any other school.  MJ: Where were you when you found out the Supreme Court was kicking your case back to the lower court?  GG: I was in class. I was very disappointed, of course, that this was not going to be over as soon as I had hoped. Not only will it take a bigger chunk of time out of my life, but also, more importantly, the kids that are stuck in limbo in the meantimeI'm so upset that that part of it will drag on even longer. But I mean, that's just how the cookie crumbles. So rather than focusing on what I can't control, I just set my sights on what I can control, and that's what I do going forward.  MJ: Have lots of people been reaching out to you to thank you for standing up in this cause or tell you their story?  GG: Hundreds of people. I've had so many narratives shared with me, from people who say, \"You help me understand my child,\" to people who say, \"I'm an educator and you help me support my students.\" It's been so beautiful that people feel safe to share those with me. I love hearing it every time.  \"This isn't the end of the road...This case isn't over, it hasn't gone away.\"  MJ: You protested outside the White House last month after the Trump administration rescinded the Obama-era guidance protecting trans kids in schools. Can you describe what that night of protest was like? What was your main message for Trump?  GG: You know, it was really surreal. When I was younger, I was politically activejust in my day-to-day life, I tried to stay as informed as possible. I always sort of thought that when I was an adult I'd participate in things like that, but I never, ever thought I'd be participating in something central to myself. I thought I'd be standing beside other people for a common cause but never thought I'd be that common cause, and my rights and the rights of trans youth would be that common cause. So it was absolutely breathtaking and surreal and just totally, totally humbling. It really showed me how much love and support I have, to a more tangible degree.  And then to your second question, I don't really have a message directly to the administration. My goal is to promote positivity, and I think rather than address that head on, I'd like to voice a message of support and encouragement to the trans youth out there who are feeling scared and lost and alone and angry and sad: You know, this isn't the end of the road, there are still people fighting for them. This case isn't over, it hasn't gone away. Regardless of what happens with this case specifically, in the end equality will absolutely prevail, absolutely. I believe that with every fiber of my being. And I hope they can keep that in mind and try to find time to love themselves going forward.", "date": "2017/03/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/gavin-grimm-will-keep-fighting-transgender-rights", "title": "Gavin Grimm Is a Transgender Teen Hero\u0089\u00db\u00d3And He\u0089\u00db\u00aas Just Getting Started"}, {"text": "Gavin Grimm talks with reporters during a protest outside the White House on February 20.  The Supreme Court on Monday kicked a historic transgender rights case back to a lower court, after the Trump administration changed the federal government's position on whether trans students can use bathrooms matching their gender identities.  The highly anticipated case, which had been scheduled for a Supreme Court hearing later this month, centers on a 17-year-old transgender boy named Gavin Grimm who is suing for access to the boys' bathroom at his school in Virginia. Grimm's case argues that the school's decision to block him from that bathroom violates Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in public schools. Had the Supreme Court chosen to hear the case, it would have been the first time the justices had ever considered a question about trans rights.  \"Today our momentum was sent on a detour, but nothing can stop it. We will fight. We will win,\" tweeted one of Grimm's attorneys.  Grimm, who was born a girl but identifies as a boy, started using the boys' bathroom at school his sophomore year, after doctors diagnosed him with gender dysphoria and recommended that he be treated as a boy. But when parents at his school complained, his school board intervened, saying he'd either need to go back to the girls' room or use a private bathroom near the nurse's office. The school board said it was trying to protect the privacy of other students.  Last May, the Obama administration put out a directive warning that public schools could lose federal funding if they blocked trans kids from using the bathrooms of their choice. The directive said Title IX prohibited discrimination based on gender identity, not just based on sex. But in February, President Donald Trump's administration changed the federal government's position, saying that it wasn't sure how to interpret Title IX and that schools could go back to blocking trans kids from bathrooms. Because the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had relied heavily on the Obama administration's interpretation in its decision about Grimm's case last year, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the circuit court to reconsider the case. Now it'll be up to that lower court to decide what Title IX means, and whether the law prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.  Over the past couple of years, the debate over transgender rights and bathrooms has heated up nationally. Only one state, North Carolina, has enacted legislation requiring trans people to use bathrooms matching their birth sex instead of their gender identity. But at least 10 other states have considered similar legislation already this year, and schools across the country have instituted similar policies. In an amicus brief filed last week, parents wrote about how their trans children have been humiliated and stigmatized as a result. Many others also submitted briefs in support of Grimm, including nearly 200 members of Congress, dozens of major corporations, 18 states and over 30 US cities, the NAACP, and the National Parent-Teacher Association (PTA).  The issue isn't just about bathrooms. \"It's about the right of trans people to exist in public spaces,\" Grimm told reporters on a press call on Monday. Without access to bathrooms, he says, it's hard for trans people to sit through class, run errands, or hold jobs.  The case will not come before the Supreme Court again this term, Grimm's attorneys say, and possibly not for another few years. \"We will not have our day in the high court this term but we will continue to fight in the lower courts,\" Chase Strangio, one of his lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote. \"Today our momentum was sent on a detour,\" he added in a tweet, \"but nothing can stop it. We will fight. We will win.\"  Grimm was sitting in class on Monday morning when text messages started flooding his phone with the Supreme Court's announcement. He was disappointed but vowed to keep fighting. Whether it takes another year or 10, he says, \"I'm in it for the long haul.\"", "date": "2017/03/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/supreme-court-wont-decide-landmark-transgender-rights-case", "title": "Thanks to Trump, the Supreme Court Just Left Trans Kids Hanging in a Big Way"}, {"text": "With a stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump threw Shadi Heidarifar's world into a tailspin. The 23-year-old philosophy student lives in Tehran, Iran, and has spent years trying to get into a university in the United States. She was recently admitted to NYU, her top choice, and was preparing to apply for a student visa. (Each year, some 4,000 Iranians receive visas to study at American universities.) But with Trump's executive order on Friday, the United States has put a temporary block on immigration from Iran and six other predominantly Muslim countries, which means Heidarifar may not make it to class this fall. I reached out to hear her storytold in her own words below.  My name is Shadi Heidarifarin Persian, Shadi means \"happiness.\" I'm 23 years old, and I've lived my whole life in Tehran, the capital of Iran. My father recently retired from his job as a manager at a gas station, my mother is a housewife, and I have a younger brother in high school.  I was the first in my family to go to universityI finished my bachelor's in philosophy at the University of Tehranand I recently got admitted to NYU's philosophy department, where I planned to get a master's degree. It was very difficult to come up with the money for the application. Most American universities have an application fee of around $70 to $100, which is enough for a month of living expenses in most cities of Iran. Money can be tight sometimes, so I worked part time at a bookstore near my university for more than a year to pay the application fees.  I'm interested in studying ethics and political philosophyquestions like what should our values be in a modern society, how can we act morally, and what it's like to have a democracy. I hope I can teach in these areas. I want to help this country and other countries come together and have good relations, by thinking about the choices we should make in social and political relations.  When I was accepted at NYU, I was over the moon. It's the first-ranked university in my major, so every philosophy student dreams about NYU. I spent three years trying to get admitted, to improve my English, to keep in contact with the faculty there.  I've never been to the United States before because it's too hard to get a tourist visa for Iranians, but since I was in high school, I've liked the idea of living in NYC. I think US culture is popular among most young people around the worldmost people know Hollywood and watch lots of movies. I myself am interested in jazz music, like Sinatra and Armstrong. Of American food, pizza is most famous in Iran, and most fast food from the USA is popular. For me, NYC is among the greatest cities in the worldit is a big, crowded, modern city like Tehran, and its diversity is unbelievable.  If he wants to make America great againand I think it is already great nowmaybe he should only sign orders that affect diversity in a democratic way that everybody feels is respectful.  And education is important in my family. \"It will help you live a much better life than your parents lived,\" my father says to me all the time. It may sound a little strange because people in most Western countries think differently about our life in the Middle East, but my father is my greatest supporterhe wants me to never give up. Still, while there have been many improvements, it's hard for women to continue their studies here. In almost every major, it's a priority for universities to choose men instead of women students. This situation gets worse at the graduate degree level, and this is one reason why I want to study abroad. Also, it is hard for women here to find work and get paid equally after they graduate.  At the end of August I'm supposed to start classes, but getting a student visa is so hard for us, so if we want to reserve an appointment [with the US Embassy], we should do this now. Now I can't, and I'm afraid I will miss the fall semester. In fact, I'm really worried I might not be able to go at all. If I cannot get a visa in time, I will enroll in another universityI've been admitted to schools in Canada, the UK, Germany, and Austria. But I believe NYU is a better place for me. I wanted to work there with the greatest philosophers in my majorDavid Chalmers, Ned Block, Paul Boghossian.  It's not just me. A lot of Iranian students spend so much energy and time, studying hard to get admission to American universities. Some have gotten a visa but now cannot catch a flight, and some caught their flight but cannot enter the United States. Some Iranian men and women are in the USA and their spouse is in Iran; they cannot see each other. All of us are really hopeless. But here is one point that we strongly believe, even without visiting the USA: We Iranian students strongly believe that diversity in ethnicity, race, religion, and color is one of the greatest strengths of the United States. And Trump's Muslim ban will destroy this.  I did not expect him to win the election. I thought Hillary Clinton would win. Anyway, I think he loves the USA, but his way of protecting the country is different. Building a wall, separating families from each other, and banning visas to people in Muslim countries just makes our world too scary. If he wants to make America great againand I think it is already great nowmaybe he should only sign orders that affect diversity in a democratic way that everybody feels is respectful. Remember that America is not a country just for Americans; there are lots of Iranians, Mexicans, Chinese. There are too many American families that have a foreign member, and his decision will tear so many families apart.  I don't know how he could sign an order that doesn't make sense. It is ridiculous to call a person a terrorist or a supporter of ISIS just because of her religion or nationality. Iranian students think the most prosperous universities around the world are in the United States. We don't support ISIS or anything like thatwe hate them. We also have so many different religions in Iran. Also, most of the Iranian students in the USA are really successful and help American society to become better in different ways, such as working in great companies, becoming businessmen, professors, etc. This will make us lose everything we built over the years to get admission to US universities.  I study philosophy because I think it can help us to know how to keep ourselves, how to keep our commitments to democracy, how to help make the world great. I think it's unfair for Iranian students to lose our dreams, our hope, and our admissions just because we are Iranian and Muslim.", "date": "2017/01/29", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/iranian-student-trump-immigration", "title": "I'm an Iranian Woman Whose Dream Is to Study in America. Here's My Message for Trump."}, {"text": "Rex Tillerson during an Economic Club of Washington event in DC in 2015  This week, Congress will consider whether to confirm President-elect Donald Trump's appointment for secretary of state. Trump's choice, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, has come under fire for his close relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin and his lack of government experience. As Tillerson seeks to become America's top diplomat, another aspect of his past should come under scrutiny: his former company's troubling ties to allegations of torture and other grave human rights abuses in Indonesia.  Until recently, Exxon Mobil worked extensively in Indonesia's Aceh Province, home to one of the globe's largest natural gas fields. A company executive once said that for a time, Exxon Mobil's operations in the region were \"the jewel in the company's crown.\" Back in the 1970s, Mobil Corp.which in 1999 merged with Exxon Corp.obtained exclusive rights to extract gas from the area and began a joint venture with the Indonesian government to process it. The company soon started employing Indonesian soldiers to protect its operations there. But in the 1990s and early 2000s, amid a war between the Indonesian military and armed separatists in the region, some of the soldiers working for the company allegedly detained, tortured, and even killed local Indonesian people who lived and worked nearby, according to a lawsuit first filed in the United States in 2001. Another lawsuit was filed on behalf of more Indonesians in 2007 and consolidated with the first.  According to the lawsuits, one plaintiff was allegedly shot in the knee by an Exxon Mobil security official while riding his bike home from a local plantation, where he worked as a laborer. When another plaintiff tried to intervene, a security official stomped on his head. A third plaintiff said security officials shocked him in the genitals with electricity and brought him to a pit filled with human heads. Their lawyer, Terry Collingsworth of International Rights Advocates, says he's met dozens of people in Aceh with similar complaints. In response to my questions about the case, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil told me the company \"categorically denies any complicity in any human rights abuses committed by Indonesian soldiers during an Indonesian civil war.\"  The Indonesian plaintiffs say top Exxon Mobil executives in Texas knew or should have known about the alleged abuse but kept the soldiers on board for security anyway. During the first few years of abuse outlined in the complaints, Rex Tillerson was executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Company, a subsidiary that develops Exxon Mobil's exploration and production projects around the world. He became senior vice president of Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2001 and its president a few years later. Exxon Mobil says Tillerson had no responsibility for operations in Aceh \"during the relevant time period.\" Collingsworth says there's no evidence to suggest he was making decisions related to the retention of Indonesian soldiers as security.  But it's hard to believe Tillerson wouldn't have had some idea of what was happening in Aceh. The abuse was covered by news organizationsincluding the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journalas early as the 1990s. \"There wasn't a single person in Aceh who didn't know that massacres were taking place,\" a former top government official in Aceh told BusinessWeek in a 1998 investigation. In 2001, Time magazine wrote that in Aceh, \"people literally line up to tell stories of abuse and murders committed by troops they call Exxon's army.\" Marco Simons, a legal director for the advocacy group EarthRights International who filed a brief in support of the Indonesians in 2010, says it's troubling that some of the problems in Aceh happened while Tillerson was among the company's top executives: \"Either he knew about it and condoned it or he didn't have sufficient control over his operations to know about what was going on.\"  After the first lawsuit was filed in 2001, the abuse allegedly continued for a few years, until a brutal tsunami devastated Aceh and essentially ended the ongoing war between the separatists and Indonesia's military. Exxon Mobil continued to employ the soldiers after that. In 2005, Exxon Mobil's shareholders asked the company to report back to them about security arrangements with Indonesia's military, but the company's directors objected.  In 2006, Tillerson took the reins as Exxon Mobil's CEO. The company continued employing Indonesian soldiers in Aceh, according to the 2007 complaint. \"Defendants have refused demands to investigate, improve, or cease its security forces' abusive actions,\" the plaintiffs charged. Years earlier, Tillerson and other Exxon Mobil executives had met with officials in Indonesia; some, like former CEO Lucio Noto and former executive vice president Harry Longwell, had discussed the security problems in Aceh, but it's not clear whether Tillerson broached this subject during his meetings. In 2015, Exxon Mobil sold its Aceh assets to Indonesia's state oil company.  The litigation between Exxon Mobil and the Indonesian plaintiffs has now dragged on for about 16 years. A judge ruled in 2015 that the case could continue to move forward, stating that \"the Court accepts as true for purposes of this motion\" the assertion that \"Exxon exercised substantial control over the activities of these soldiers.\" Collingsworth says his clients are still waiting for justice. \"Some part of that is Rex Tillerson,\" he says. \"He [was] the CEO. He could say, 'These people got hurt, the war's over, why don't we help them?'\"  Collingsworth worries a State Department under Tillerson could intervene to side with big companies like Exxon Mobil in future human rights abuse cases. There's some precedent for this: In 2002, the State Department under President George W. Bush warned a court in the United States that allowing the Indonesians to pursue their lawsuit against Exxon Mobil could have a \"potentially serious adverse impact\" on US government interests. Now, Collingsworth said, the State Department has the power to determine whether his plaintiffs and witnesses can get visas to travel to the United States for trialhe adds that a trial date is imminent. More generally, he adds, the State Department can play a role in promoting rule of law in countries abroad. But if Tillerson, \"the most prominent of all CEOs of the biggest oil company,\" is appointed, he says, it'll send a message to people around the globe: \"The world is open for businessenvironment and human rights be damned.\"", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trumps-pick-secretary-state-rex-tillerson-linked-human-rights-abuses-indonesia", "title": "Torture Allegations Shadow Rex Tillerson's Time at Exxon Mobil"}, {"text": "On an icy Saturday afternoon in early February, the rebuilding of the Democratic party was happening in Jessica Williams' Long Island living room. Williams, a social worker who in her free time hosts a podcast about dance, supported Bernie Sanders during the presidential primary but hadn't volunteered for a political campaign in years. Everything changed in November. \"I was like, holy crap, this democracy business is a whole lot more fragile than I realized,\" she says.  Williams discovered a new group, Knock Every Door, that was organizing post-election canvasses in areas that had swung toward Trump in November. She signed up to host her own event and posted an invitation on Facebook. Eight people, mostly millennial supporters of Sanders who had never canvassed before, responded.  Their assignment was to go door-to-door in Williams' neighborhood in Stewart Manor, New York, asking anyone who was home a series of questions about the 2016 election. But it was a wholly different kind of canvassing than the kind typically conducted by political campaigns, which target select voters from curated lists and train volunteers to be as efficient as possible. Williams did not have a list of names. There was no literature to hand out. She had no candidate or policy to talk up. The object was to get voters talking about the electionand not let them stop.  \"Think of this as like a Terry Gross interview,\" Williams suggested, as they munched on pizza before heading out. \"We're just trying to get them to open up a little more.\" Each volunteer toted a clipboard with several pages of questions (\"How do you think the country will change in the next four years?\" \"Who do you think will benefit as a result of Trump being president?\") designed to give structure to the conversation.  Knock Every Doorformed in January by a group of Sanders campaign alums and led by his organizing guru Becky Bondis an oddity among the hundreds of liberal groups that have popped up in the wake of Trump's election. The name gives away its mission; the group is focused on reaching two groups of voters: people who voted for Obama in 2012 and then flipped to Trump four years later, and the people who simply didn't vote at all.  \"Think of this as like a Terry Gross interview,\" Williams suggested, as they munched on pizza before heading outside. \"We're just trying to get them to open up a little more.\"  Part of the mission is data-collection. Bond, who helped build Sanders' national field organization, believes that the party's fealty to Big Data and analytics caused it to miss something significant, and perhaps obvious, about the electorate. Knock Every Door wants to hear from the voters Clinton missed to make sure that doesn't happen again. \"We find ourselves in an election and we don't know how to talk to people,\" Bond says. The group plans to turn over the info it gathers to local Democratic groups, so that candidates will know who to connect with and how.  But the group also believes that the style of conversation itself, known as \"deep canvassing,\" could play a part in winning these voters over. Bond's theory, inspired by the groundbreaking work of the Leadership Lab, a gay-rights organization in Los Angeles, is that the most effective way to soften people's politics may be to hear them out. The Leadership Lab schools its canvassers in personal, and long-winded encountersin contrast to the staccato interactions campaigns usually emphasize. The results are intriguing: A 2016 study in Science found that a 10-minute conversation with one of the Leadership Lab's organizers caused voters to view transgender rights more favorably three months down the road.  For its grand ambitions, Knock Every Door has been assembled with duct tape and scratch paper. Bond and a few co-conspirators came up with the idea 10 days before the inauguration and held their first series of canvasses on the day of the women's march. A Sanders colleague lent them a peer-to-peer messaging service he'd devised for the campaign to help wrangle the thousand people who signed up within the first 30 days, and two other veterans of the campaign's digital operation built a website. Bond folded the group into an existing political action committee she'd set up, and a Sanders donor promised to match all donations up to $15,000. It was enough, anyway, to get the operation off the ground and into the streets.  Its numbers are growing fast. In February, Knock Every Door joined forces with SwingLeft, a new organization formed after the election that matches progressive activists with the nearest competitive congressional district. Starting in March, SwingLeft's members will start going door-to-door in swing districts engaging in deep canvassing using the script distributed by Bond. The partnership expanded Bond's pool of volunteers by several orders of magnitude; within a few days of its first conference call with SwingLeft, Knock Every Door had picked up more than 800 new canvassers. So far members have already held 53 canvasses in 22 states.  Bond is not the only progressive organizer who believes the party's grassroots need to reintroduce themselves to their neighbors. In Nebraska, where Sanders supporters recently took charge of the struggling state party, Democrats are planning to embark on a statewide canvass that will, they hope, reach every door in the state. (Or almost every doorTom Tilden, an associate chair of the state party, said that while they hoped to reach every house in the state's small towns, the canvass would be more selective in population centers such as Lincoln and Omaha.)  These post-election exercises share a common inspiration in the work of the Leadership Lab and its founder, Dave Fleischer, who began experimenting with deep canvassing after his state passed Prop 8, a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Fleischer has offered pointers to Knock Every Door but has no role with the group. \"It reminds me of 2008 in California,\" he said of the climate on the left today. \"The polls all showed the LGBT issue winning, and then we lost. We didn't understand what had happened.\"  Fleischer understood the anger at voters who had turned against his community, but where his peers turned to protest, he focused on persuasion. If enough Prop 8 supporters could have friendlybut candidconversations with LGBT canvassers like himself, maybe it would move the needle. After years of tinkering, he settled on a script that appeared to work. Since then, progressive organizers have flocked to LA like Jedi to Dagobah, anxious to crack the code and try out his techniques in their communities.  \"It reminds me of 2008 in California,\" he said of the climate on the left today. \"The polls all showed the LGBT issue winning, and then we lost. We didn't understand what had happened.\"  On the day after the inauguration, Knock Every Door sent four people to shadow Fleischer on a post-election canvass about the election outside Los Angeles, and then worked with political scientists to draft a script for their canvassesthe same script that Williams' canvassers carried with them in Stewart Manor. (Fleischer's own project is focused on engaging Trump voters' racial prejudices.)  But Fleischer's success also carries a lesson for progressives hoping to mimic it. It took years of trial-and-error before he found something that worked on just one issue; Democrats might be screwed if they can't turn things around in just two years. The script that eventually produced a breakthrough was Fleischer's 74th attempt. He brings a videographer with him on his rounds and studies the tapes afterwards to figure out what worked and what didn't. When we met at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, he pulled out a laptop to show me footage of his first two post-election conversations in Los Angeles, and then peppered me with questions. What did I think about the Knock Every Door canvassers? How did it mesh with my conversations with Trump supporters? Fleischer is always canvassing, even when he's not.  After two hours of door-knocking in Long Island, Williams' volunteers returned to her dining room, where they sat at a picnic bench comparing notes over Belgian beer and samosas. They confessed to being timid at first. Their conversations had been a far cry from the skillful repartee I'd seen on Fleischer's laptop. But it hadn't been a wasted afternoon either. One thing they discovered was that it was the first time in years that any of the people in the neighborhood had been canvassedeven though they live in a congressional district that Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi won by just 17,000 votes last year.  And while there were plenty of dead-endsone woman, who had supported Trump, refused to open her door and shouted her responses through the glassthey found the experience as a whole to be encouraging. A man in a Yankees t-shirt, who'd voted for Obama twice before casting his ballot for Trump, confessed that he believed the president would be impeached before his first term was up. One resident, who had supported Hillary Clinton but preferred Joe Biden, invited a canvasser into his home to talk to a half dozen of his friends, including the town's former mayor.  No one came away feeling as if theyd flipped a voter from one side to another. But they saw value in making the introduction. Adrian Enscoe, a musician from Brooklyn who had never canvassed before, soon made plans to host his own meet-up in Bushwick. \"Apparently people just like talking,\" he said.", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/these-democrats-are-going-door-door-asking-trump-voters-simple-question", "title": "These Bernie Alums Think They've Found the Secret to Reaching Trump Voters"}, {"text": "And to think, that was the easy part. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was elected as chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, edging out Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison in the first competitive election for the job in decades. The 55-year-old Perez, the first Latino chair of the party, will now inherit the most thankless job in politicsrebuilding a party that is at its lowest point since the 1920s.  The race was often miscast as a proxy fight between supporters of Bernie Sanders and supporters of Hillary Clinton, a framing that was unfair to both Ellison and Perez, dynamic and progressive political operatives running for a job often reserved for staid political figures. In the end, Perez's win was not a rejection of Ellison's vision of the party; in key ways, his campaign was an affirmation of it.  Party chair is a position typically of interest only to political junkies. But with organizers still amped up from the presidential election, the race had the feel and structure of a competitive primary, with a half-dozen candidate forums across the country and an intensive push from rank-and-file voters that recalled previous courting of superdelegates. \"I've been lobbied consistently by phone, by email, by Facebook, by Twitter for the last month,\" said Melvin Poindexter, a DNC member from Massachusetts who was supporting Ellison.  Ellison, for his part, tried to tamp down the barrage of phone calls on his behalf, which one state party chair unfavorably described as \"anarchy.\" But aggressive lobbying proved critical. Kerman Maddox, a DNC member from California, explained that he'd chosen Perez in part because \"Tom called me more than any of the other Democratic candidates\"a sentiment echoed by other voting members.  After the results were announced, a dozen Ellison supportersincluding the congressman's brother, Ericchanted \"party for the people, not big money\" from the back of the Atlanta ballroom, with a few cries of \"bullshit!\" thrown in. While the formal final vote, sealed on the second ballot, was 235 to 200, in a show of unity, Perez was subsequently elected by acclamation. In his first move as chair, he announced that Ellison had agreed to serve as his deputy chair.  \"If you're wearing a 'Keith' t-shirtor any t-shirtI am asking you to give everything you've got to support chairman Perez,\" Ellison told the room. Afterward, they switched campaign pins in a show of solidarity.  In the run up to the vote, some Ellison backers argued that there was no real case for a Perez chairmanshipthat he was running as a check on Sanders' influence and little more. But DNC members I spoke with seemed to understand Perez's pitch quite clearly: he was a turnaround artist who had retooled complex bureaucracies toward progressive ends, first at the Maryland Department of Labor, then at the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, and finally as President Barack Obama's Labor Secretary. If progressives had forgotten what they liked about Perez, they needed to look no farther than the conservative Breitbart News, which once heralded Perez \"the most radical cabinet secretary since Henry Wallace,\" the New Dealer who eventually bolted the Democrats to mount a third party challenge in 1948.  The fights that Perez has waged over the course of his career track closely with those Ellison cut his teeth on in Minneapolishousing discrimination, voter suppression, and living wages. Neo-liberal stooges still have a place in the Democratic party. But the DNC chair isn't one of them.  Beyond their shared political priorities, Perez even offered a similar diagnosis as Ellison. The party had become top-heavy, focusing too much on the presidential race, and had neglected to compete on a county-by-county level. He advocated something resembling a restoration of former chair Howard Dean's 50-state strategy, and proposed to spend more time knocking on doors in off-year elections. There was no talk of compromising with President Donald Trump; Perez dubbed him \"the worst president in the history of the United States.\"  Ellison sought to win the same way he always has, through a mastery of coalition politics. His backers included American Federation of Teachers, the AFL-CIO, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, Rep. John Lewis, and Sandersmany of whom found themselves on opposing sides during the president primary. The threat by OJ Simpson counsel and Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz< to leave the party if Ellison won did not appear to have a substantial effect on voters. (Maybe they were waiting to hear from F. Lee Bailey.) He ran not as Sanders 2.0, but as a restoration of an even older form of Democratic progressivism, one evoked by the spruce-green colors on his t-shirts and tote bagsthe campaign colors of his political idol, the late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone.  Just a few hours before the election, there was an indication Ellison might come up short when the committee members voted on a resolution that would reinstate the party's ban on corporate donations. The ban, which was first implemented by president-elect Barack Obama in 2008, had been dropped last year by the previous party chair, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Ellison envisioned a party fundraising model in the mold of Sanders' small-dollar campaign, and many backers had supported the reinstatement of the ban, although the candidate himself did not back the resolution.* Perez, unlike Ellison, never expressed any interest in reinstating the contribution ban.  The resolution brought on the most contentious 10 minutes of a weekend that, up until then, had been a love-fest. Bob Mulholland of California, the leading critic of the ban, chided critics as naive. He cited corporate opposition to ousted North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory as proof that corporations aren't all evil. Supporters of the ban, some of the new party leaders whom had been recently elected to their posts with the backing of Sanders's supporters, implicitly tied the resolution to the senator's one-time candidacy, warning that the party risked alienating voters who cared about money in politics. Jessica Sell Chambers, a Sanders backer and the newly minted national committeewoman from Wyoming, offered a succinct appraisal: \"I belong to the party of the people and the last time I checked corporations aren't people.\"  Inside the Westin, where Democrats began assembling on Thursday, the notion that the chair candidates were engaged in a rancorous, existential fight seemed far-fetched. Perez, who was hoarse from two days of lobbying as he made a last-minute push Friday night, had taken to calling the event \"Unity Saturday.\" Even the most die-hard Ellison supporters were optimistic that the party would be in good hands win or lose. Each of the leading candidates devoted portions of their stump speech to a call for unity no matter who won.  \"I really just want to like put at least four of them together,\" said Dolly Strazar from Hawaii, a Sanders supporter who ended up backing Perez. Another voting member, Aleita Huguenin of California, predicted that the fight would quickly simmer down. \"I've been through too many of them,\" she said. \"People are a little disappointed, they have two dinners, and will be back together.\"  In reality, the contentious fight over the future of the party never really described the DNC racebut there is such a battle playing out across the country. Already, Sanders supporters, both organically and with the support of the Senator's non-profit Our Revolution, have begun targeting the party's apparatus at state, county, and local levels. They are poised to take over the California Democratic party in May, after winning a majority of delegates to the state convention in January. The Sanders wing is ascendant in Nebraska and Wyoming, and setting its sights on Florida and Michigan. Beyond party positions, re-energized Sanders supporters are talking openly about primary challenges to Democratic officeholders who support Donald Trump's policies.  Less than a year after only 39 of 447 DNC members endorsed Sanders' presidential campaign, his chosen candidate came about 15 votes short of taking over the whole thing. The numbers reflect Sanders' forces growing strength in the party, a gradual upheaval that may only be sped along by Perez's victory. DNC members from Wyomingwhere the Vermont senator notched a huge caucus victory but due to party rules emerged with few delegateswho are not on board are feeling the heat. When Bruce Palmer, the party's vice chair, told me he was supporting Tom Perez, he conceded that it may be to his own detriment. After all, he's got an election next month.  *Correction: this article originally stated that Ellison had backed the proposed ban on corporate PAC donations.", "date": "2017/02/25", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/dnc-chair-election", "title": "The DNC Chair Race Is Over.

Organizers have used Trump protests to recruit members for new groups such as Sister District.  Last fall, Rita Bosworth, a public defender in San Francisco, had an epiphany. \"I was thinking about how we were choosing between two Democrats for this open Senate seat,\" she said. Because California's open primary system leaves the possibility that two members of the same party will advance to the general election, state Attorney General Kamala Harris faced off against Rep. Loretta Sanchez in the race to succeed retiring Democrat Barbara Boxer. They combined to spend nearly $20 million on the contest, which Harris won, and \"all of it was being directed toward a race where it was liberal vs. more liberal,\" Bosworth says. \"It just struck me that this was silly.\" There had to be a better use of progressive manpower.  So in late November, Bosworth launched Sister District, a website that helps activists in safe blue areas support candidates in red states and swing districts who could use the help. Sister District, which boasts about 5,000 members and has been recruiting at anti-Donald Trump protests and on social media, is in the process of filing for tax-exempt status as a 527, allowing it to raise money and donate directly to candidates for state office. It recently joined forces with another organization with a similar agenda, Flippable, on a race they hope will demonstrate the power of the suddenly energized grassroots left: a special election for a Delaware state Senate seat that will determine the balance of power in the state Capitol.  The two groups have already raised more than $87,000 for the Democratic candidate, Stephanie Hansena remarkable sum for a state Senate special election in a small market. Sister District members have held five fundraisers, and they have another one planned later this month at a bar in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood.  In the age of Trump, coastal progressives such as Bosworth have increasingly come to believe that Democrats are fighting not just nativism, but also geography. In an op-ed for the New York Times three weeks before the election, reporter Alec MacGillis neatly summed up the Democrats' struggles. \"Democrats,\" he wrote, \"just don't want to live where they'd need to live to turn more of the map blue.\" The headline for the story offered a prescription: \"If you really want Democrats to win in Iowa, move there.\" The geographic clustering of liberals in major metropolitan areas and isolated college towns poses a logistical hurdle. How do you convert excess activist energy in one place into organizing power someplace else?  In addition to Sister District and Flippablea group focused on state-level races that promises to tell Democrats \"which races are most important, who's running, and how you can support them\"other groups have taken similar approaches to the ever-reddening political map. Resurgent Left, a political action committee led by San Francisco lawyer Kipp Mueller, promises to \"use advanced analytics to find Democratic candidates with the best chances to flip their state legislatures blue anywhere in the U.S.\" Code Blue, created by a Los Angeles-based executive producer of the Food Network series Cake Masters, has already raised money and made phone calls for state delegate candidates in Virginia, Minnesota, and Connecticut. Adopt-a-State, founded by a Maryland IT professional, invites members to host \"adoption parties\" to raise money for red-state Democratic parties. (In Brooklyn, supporters are donating to the North Carolina Democrats with proceeds from a monthly Park Slope happy hour.)  These fledgling outfits are more collaborative than competitive. They link to each other's websites on their home pages, share resources, and talk regularly to coordinate their activities. \"There are kind of these subtle variations between the groups,\" Bosworth says. \"For now, we're all happy and moving along.\" Flippable co-founder Catherine Vaughan, who worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in Ohio, calls her like-minded colleagues \"the Rebuilds\" and keeps in contact with fellow organizers through a Slack group. \"I'm in conversations with everyoneit takes up most of my day,\" she says. \"Among the Rebuilds there's a really strong sense of 'We're all in this together.' There's a lot of collaboration.\"  Sister District and co. are focused on down-ballot races, both because modest resources in these contests can make a big difference and because state legislatures control decennial redistrictingone of the factors that make the Democrats' regionalism more pronounced. In Virginia, for instance, Republicans control 66 of 100 seats in the House of Delegates even though they have not won a statewide race since 2009. But there's also a project for adopting congressional districts: SwingLeft, a site launched by Ethan Todras-Whitehill, a freelance writer and GMAT tutor in Amherst, Massachusetts.  Prior to this year, Todras-Whitehill's political experience consisted of a few phone calls on behalf of John Kerry in 2004 and a brief stint running get-out-the-vote operations for Barack Obama in 2008 in Warren County, Ohioone of the white Midwestern communities that swung hardest to Trump in November. A political junkie by habit, he had expected after the election to spend more time working on his fiction. Instead, he found himself at a coffee shop on November 9, playing around with a CNN.com map of every House district in the country.  Western Massachusetts is safe Democratic territory, so Todras-Whitehill searched for the closest district that wasn't. He settled on New York's 19th Congressional District, a Hudson Valley seat where Democrat Zephyr Teachout lost by 6 points to Republican John Faso. \"I went on Facebook and said I'm gonna focus on 2018 in NY-19,\" he says. \"And I started thinking, why did I have to do all this work? In this day and age, why isn't there a tool that will do this for me?\"  With two friends from Silicon Valley, he launched SwingLeft one day before Trump's inauguration and has collected more than 250,000 sign-ups. All you have to do is enter your zip codethen it matches you with the closest competitive district. Users receive regular updates on what's happening in the district and eventually get further instructions from a volunteer district leader. Although the founders have little political experience themselves, they have been talking to Democratic campaign professionals about how to proceed. (Todras-Whitehill recently finished reading Rules for Revolutionaries, the organizing handbook written by Bernie Sanders campaign veterans Becky Bond and Zack Exley.)  Some districts, such as Virginia's 10th (currently represented by Republican Barbara Comstock), already have tens of thousands of sign-ups, and that Northern Virginia chapter already held its first in-person meet-up last month. But the group's goal is for every swing district to have tens of thousands of progressives who live in noncompetitive districts helping out.  Todras-Whitehill is aware that the perception that a candidate is being propped up by money and manpower from outside the district can be a damaging onehe calls it the \"Hollywood effect.\" But SwingLeft isn't matching regions arbitrarily. The point of finding volunteers in neighboring districts is that they'll already be starting on a shared foundation. Someone who lives in a safe-blue suburban Denver district still has a lot in common with someone who lives in a 50-50 district next door. The goal is for \"people to know their swing district better than they know their own representative.\"  The need to reconcile the Democratic Party's uneven distribution of resources has not been lost on the candidates vying for leadership roles in the national party. In addition to full-time organizing hubs in the Rust Belt states Clinton lost, \"we should have satellite hubs in Alabama that connect with Philadelphia donors and Baltimore donors,\" says Elizabeth Jaff, a candidate for Democratic National Committee vice chair who is also the head of business development and campaigns at the digital fundraising platform Crowdpac. \"We should do sister districts, where California picks up different states that they're funding.\"  Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a front-runner in the race for DNC chair and a former community organizer, has made cross-pollination part of his campaign message. \"What if we took a nice, solid district where there's a lot of Democrats, and we went out to a red state, and we said, 'We're gonna partner you guys together'?\" he told an audience of Detroit Democrats in December. \"So that we are taking the benefits of what the blue state knows and put it with the red state and we're sharing. And they're doing phone banks, helping do some door knocks, help do some fundraising. It would help people understand each other a little better.\"  As the institutions of the Democratic Party slowly jolt into motion, the Rebuilds will have to adapt as well. Attrition is inevitable. But for now, with the DNC in a holding pattern as it awaits its leader, the influx of new groups into the same space is chaos by design. \"Who knows if Code Blues gonna be around in six months,\" says its founder, MJ Loheed. \"I hope it is, but it's good to have redundancies. I think it's a breeding ground for innovation.\" Vaughan recalled the message David Plouffe, Obama's former campaign manager, delivered on a post-election conference call with a small army of Democratic organizers and campaign professionals. Plouffe's message, as paraphrased by Vaughan: \"Let a thousand flowers bloom.\"", "date": "2017/02/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/swing-left-sister-district-flippable-delaware", "title": "The Secret Slack Group Plotting to Turn Your State Government Blue"}, {"text": "As the Democratic Party struggles to regain its footing following its disastrous November election, one vestige of the 2016 campaign has taken on much importance: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' email list. Sanders, who raised $218 million online from a record 2.8 million donors, rewrote the rules of email fundraising during his campaign by relentlessly courting small-dollar contributors. For many of those donors, Sanders was the first Democratic presidential candidate they had supportedor the first politician they had ever helped.  In an interview with the Huffington Post in December, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, a front-runner in the election for Democratic National Committee chair, said he wants \"to learn from Senator Sanders about how he did it.\" At a DNC chair debate in January, another candidate, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), whom Sanders has endorsed for the DNC job and who is widely seen as someone who can heal the party's Sanders-Clinton divisions, pledged to try to obtain the email list for the party if he wins. \"We're gonna call on everybody to give all the resources they have,\" Ellison said. \"We're in an emergency situation.\"  Democrats have made no secret they covet Sanders' list, which Sanders controls through his Senate campaign and the political nonprofit he founded, Our Revolution. The decision on what to do with it rests with Sanders. \"Our Revolution won't be giving over the list,\" says the group's president, Jeff Weaver, who was Sanders' presidential campaign manager. Sanders, for his part, has mostly stayed quiet about the future of the list, which one Democratic consultant referred to as his \"precious.\" He told the Washington Post in January that he would \"cross that bridge\" when he comes to it. \"There has been no discussion with the DNC about use of the list,\" says Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs.  Campaigns and political action committees regularly purchase supporter lists from other organizations, as a shortcut to raise money and recruit volunteers. Large, lucrative lists can become valuable commodities in the campaign marketplace. (President Barack Obama's presidential campaign rented his list to Organizing for Action for $1.2 million in 2015.) But former Sanders staffers and consultants scoff at the demand for the list. The way they see it, clamoring for access misses the point. The list wasn't the campaign's secret weapon; Sanders was.  \"They keep thinking it's the list,\" says Becky Bond, who as a senior adviser to Sanders helped build the candidate's national organizing operation. \"It's so crazy. It's like someone who buys a $12,000 bicycle and thinks they can win the Tour de France.\"  \"At the end of the day, it's not like there's something magical about Bernie's email listanyone can build an email list with the right investments, and you can also get millions of people on an email list,\" says Michael Whitney, who was an architect of Sanders' digital fundraising operation while working for the progressive consulting firm Revolution Messaging. \"The thing that differentiates Bernie's from any other email list has been that there is a message of people being in this together, and there was a message of empowerment.\"  \"They keep thinking it's the list. It's so crazy. It's like someone who buys a $12,000 bicycle and thinks they can win the Tour de France.\"  That may sound like campaign-strategist bluster, but in Sanders' case there's some truth to it. Sanders needed small-dollar donors because he was campaigning against the politics of big money, and supporters opened up their wallets in response to his assault on the well-heeled corporate and political establishment. His fundraising pitch and policy platform were in sync in a way that most campaigns can't match.  The Democratic National Committee, which can accept up to $33,400 in donations from individuals annuallyroughly 12 times the limit for a specific presidential or congressional campaigndoesn't work like that. It has traditionally banked its funds via the high-dollar fundraisers Sanders so despised. (Sanders supporters also came to loathe the DNC itself, which they accused of tipping the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton during the primary.) Detaching Sanders' list from his message, Sanders backers argue, would diminish what made it so valuable. \"Bernie Sanders' list isn't an ATM machine and just handing it over to the DNC might raise a little bit of money, but it won't produce a fraction of what it's capable of,\" says Tim Tagaris, who was Sanders' digital fundraising director for the campaign. \"They still need to figure out the PIN.\"  The fear among Sanders alums isn't just that the DNC can't recreate the magic. It's that the party will sap his supporters' energy with the kinds of gimmicky pitches the Sanders campaign swore off. Democrats often \"treat their email lists as Chicken Little, 'sky is falling,' trying to con money out of people, whereas Bernie took steps to actually bring people together and have messaging that they were a part of it and treat people with respect,\" Whitney says. As an example of what he and other Sanders supporters are afraid of, he points to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which peppers its email list at the end of each month with passive-aggressive \"final notice\" emails, warning them that their \"membership\" in the party will expire if they don't donate immediately.  \"They're straight up lying to people to get money,\" says Melissa Byrne, the digital director for Sanders' New Hampshire primary campaign, who is now running for vice chair of the DNC. She opposes renting the Sanders list to the party because she fears doing so will deepen the cynicism with which many Sanders supporters view the party establishment. The list is \"not something you just say, 'hey, hit export,' and then upload. People would feel like they were being disrespected. They would feel like they weren't being valued.\"  Still, these Sanders staffers don't think the DNC is a lost cause. They just think the solution is for the party to build its own Bernie list. It would require whoever takes over the DNC to be transparent with supporters about where the party was getting its money and what its goals were. And it would require some concrete structural changes within the organizationfor instance, by prohibiting donations from lobbyists, as Ellison has proposed. But if it plays its cards right, the cracks just might open. The recent fundraising success of the ACLU, which raised more than $25 million over three days after President Donald Trump announced his travel ban, speaks to the success an established organization can have in the Trump era.  So far, the leading candidates for DNC chair have both hinted at a more Sanderseque approach to fundraising. Ellison's platform promises to set a goal \"that low-dollar contributions from everyday Americans account for 33% of revenue.\" (That's about half as much as Sanders' campaign.) Perez promises to \"encourage and prioritize small-dollar fundraising,\" but he has not set a target percentage.  Or maybe there's a compromise waiting to be struck. As one former Sanders digital staffer joked in an email, noting that Sanders, via email appeals, had raised more money directly for Democratic candidates than any other politician in 2016, \"Maybe the DNC should turn their list over to Bernie?\"", "date": "2017/02/06", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/democrats-desperate-bernie-sanders-email-list", "title": "Democrats Are Desperate for Bernie Sanders' Email List"}, {"text": "Need proof that the surge of protests following the election of President Donald Trump is having an impact on members of Congress? Just listen to the complaints of Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), the former economics professor who was elected in 2014 after unseating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.  In a meeting with local conservative groups on Saturday, Brat, a fierce critic of the Affordable Care Act, lamented the vocal opposition he was facing from defenders of the health care law, and implored his supporters to write letters to the editor so they would not be drowned out. \"Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill wherever I go,\" he said. \"They come up to me and go, 'When's the next town hall?' And believe me, it's not to give positive input.\"  The video was posted to the Facebook page of \"7th District Town Hall,\" and reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The 7th District group exists for the sole purpose of persuading Brat to host a town hall meeting, at which point, presumably, he'll face a lot more questions about the Affordable Care Act.  But the Brat pack is one small part of a nationwide progressive awakening that is both spontaneous and organized, to grind Trump's agenda to a halt through direct action. Some 60,000 activists listened in on a January organizing call hosted by the founders of the Indivisible Guide, a new nonprofit founded by former congressional staffers that offers insider tips on how to get your elected officials to pay attention to you. (TL;DR: show up.) The organization's thousands of local chapters have sent delegations to representatives' and senators' district offices on an almost daily basis since Trump took office. The Town Hall Project 2018 Google doc, meanwhile, posts detailed information on all upcoming town halls being hosted by members of Congress, for the purposes of helping activists crash more town halls.  The result is that Brat isn't the only Republican who's feeling the heat. Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, who represents a deep-red district north of Houston, was confronted at a January 17 meeting at a local chamber of commerce by dozens of Obamacare supporters who showed up unexpectedly to a forum that had not been publicly announced. Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, who represents a Denver-area swing district, was caught sneaking out of a town hall filled with angry constituents in January:  While more than 100 people were waiting to meet with him, Mike Coffman sneaks out early from his own community event. #9News pic.twitter.com/NAZlXTKgQm  Nelson Garcia (@9NewsEducation) January 14, 2017  And activists have also targeted Democrats, hoping to apply leverage to elected officials who are still trying to figure out how best to take on the new administration. On Sunday, more than a thousand people marched to a town hall held by Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, to show their disapproval for his vote to confirm CEO director Mike Pompeo. (Whitehouse eventually addressed the protesters by megaphone.) That march was organized by a coalition of left-leaning groups, including the state Working Families Party, Demand Progress, and Resist Hate Rhode Island. That same day, 200 protesters rallied outside Sen. Dianne Feinstein's San Francisco home, after the sixth-term senator voted to confirm Trump's first four nominees.  When a group of Indivisible activists showed up at one of Feinstein's offices on Monday, a staffer was candid about the persistence of their efforts: \"Indivisible broke my BlackBerry, and it's close to breaking my desktop.\"", "date": "2017/01/31", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/dave-brat-women-obamacare-town-halls", "title": "\"The Women Are in My Grill No Matter Where I Go\""}, {"text": "Kara Lynum was meeting with a client Monday morning when she decided to run for office. The client was an undocumented man from Mexico, and Lynum, who is an immigration lawyer in St. Paul, Minnesota, brought up current events. \"I said to him, 'I'm really sad about Trump,' and he said, 'Yeah, you're sad, but I'm really worried about my family,'\" she says. Lynum, 35, had joined thousands of protesters at a march through the Twin Cities on Saturday and had spent weeks thinking about what the Trump administration's immigration policies would mean for her clients.  \"He was a nice guy,\" she says. \"He's been here for like 15 years. He's got a 12-year-old daughter. He said that, and I was so upset and I was like, 'You know what? I'm gonna sign up.'\"  In Virginia, a blue state in the last three presidential elections, Democrats have failed even to show up in some races: 44 of the state's 67 Republican delegates ran unopposed in 2015, including three Republicans in districts carried by Hillary Clinton.  So that afternoon, Lynum filled out an online form created by Run for Something, a new political nonprofit founded by two veteran Democratic digital organizers to recruit progressive millennials to run for office. Like many of the people contacting Run for Something, Lynum hasn't thought much about what position she'll end up running for. But she's in good company; according to the group's co-founder, Amanda Litman, more than 650 people contacted it about running in the six days since it launched on Friday. As Democrats wrestle with how to turn mass demonstrations against the new administration into political gains, Run for Something is one of a number of liberal organizations hoping the Trump era ushers in a new wave of first-time office-seekers.  Run for Something's mission is not to stop Trump in 2020, at least not directly. Its focus is on local races, where Democrats have been creamed over the last eight years, losing some 935 state legislative seats during the Obama era. In 2017, it is focusing its efforts on Virginia and North Carolina, two places where Democratic gains at the state level (the party controls the governor's mansion in both states) are undercut by conservative legislatures. In Virginia, a blue state in the last three presidential elections, Democrats have failed even to show up in some races: 44 of the state's 67 Republican delegates ran unopposed in 2015, including three Republicans in districts carried by Hillary Clinton. Democrats have a long way to go to recoup what they lost, but they've also left a lot of low-hanging fruit on the vine.  Litman, a Barack Obama campaign veteran who was email director for Clinton's 2016 effort, believes that replenishing the candidate pool has taken a back seat to other party staples, like building a get-out-the-vote program. \"Candidate recruitment isn't sexy, it takes a lot of manpower, it takes a lot time, and it needs more concerted effort,\" she says, \"which is why we are stepping up here.\"  The idea isn't just to supply candidates where none are currently running; the group believes the bench is too thin everywhere because Democrats are too exclusive in how they pick out candidates. \"Parties are usually focused on asking their electeds, their staff, their networks, who they think should run,\" Litman says. That helps build a pipeline, but it's also an echo chamber that makes it difficult for new faces and voices to penetrate. It can be intimidating, she argues, for a prospective candidate to figure out how to run, without an organization to walk him or her through it. \"So we're trying to reach people who, one, might not ever be approached by a party or by a recruitment network, or two, might not be comfortable raising their hand if the party asks, 'Who wants to run?'\" In other words, women, people of color, and members the LGBT communityall under the age of 35.  While Run for Something's founders stress that their efforts are focused on the state level, they view their program (and others like it) as an integral part of a larger rebuilding. As Litman's co-founder, Ross Morales Rocketto, puts it, \"When President Obama ran for office originally, he was in his early to mid-30s running for state Senate in Illinois.\"  Run for Something is starting off small. Its goal is to place five good candidates in state or local races in 2017. But it isn't the only outfit trying to turn Saturday's worldwide women's marches into an electoral movement. On Sunday, 500 women attended a candidate training camp in Washington, DC, hosted by Emily's List, which funds and trains pro-choice women candidates. That session was a joint project with other progressive organizations, including the Latino Victory Fund and the Gay & Lesbian Victory Institute. Another project, Brand New Congress, was launched before the election by a group of Bernie Sanders alumni with the aim of recruiting 400 first-time candidates to run for House seats in 2018.  The quest to rebuild the Democratic bench is a long-term fight with one ominous deadline in sight. The next round of redistricting is coming up in 2020, and Democrats are still paying the price for their catastrophic losses ahead of the last redistricting. If they can't get a foothold in state legislatures before thenthey currently control both houses of the legislature and the governor's mansion in just six statesthings stand to get even worse.  The dearth of Democratic candidates has not gone unnoticed by the top candidates to lead the Democratic National Committee. At a debate at George Washington University last week, two days before Trump took office, almost every candidate for chairman, including Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and former Labor Decretary Tom Perez, expressed nostalgia for the \"50 State Strategy\" pioneered by former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. (Dean was in attendance.) \"We need a 3,007-county strategy, we need a town strategy, we need a precinct strategy,\" Ellison said in December.  Democrats won't have long to find out whether their newfound enthusiasm translates into candidates.

He then defended himself as the \"least anti-Semitic\" and \"least racist person.\"  In addition to Trump's unwillingness to speak out against anti-Semitism, the administration also came under fire last month for releasing a statement commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day that conspicuously failed to mention Jews.

According to Spicer, then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the White House last month that Flynn may have misled the administration about the nature of his December phone calls with Kislyak. \"Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House counsel of the situation, the White House counsel briefed the president and a small group of senior advisers,\" Spicer said.  Spicer maintained that the decision to remove Flynn did not stem from legal concerns but a \"trust\" issue.

Hours earlier, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway made multiple media appearances in which she claimed Flynn resigned on his own.  Shortly after Tuesday's briefing, the New York Times reported that the had FBI interviewed Flynn during his brief tenure as national security adviser about his conversation with Kislyak.

They suggested Conway's statements may have violated a regulation prohibiting federal employees from using their government positions \"to endorse any product, service or enterprise.\"  The controversy follows a similar firestorm on Wednesday, when Trump accused Nordstrom of treating his daughter \"unfairly\" by announcing it would stop carrying her clothing line.

It allows State employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.\"  The \"dissent channel\" was established in the 1970s for career diplomats to confidentially express opposition to the administration's foreign policy.  \"We are better than this ban,\" the draft memo adds. \"Looking beyond its effectiveness, this ban stands in opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we as federal employees took an oath to uphold.\"  The draft memo can be read below:", "date": "2017/01/30", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-refugee-dissent-memo-1", "title": "US Diplomats Line Up to Oppose Trump's Refugee Ban"}, {"text": "People returning to a JCC evacuated in Florida in late February.  At least five more Jewish community centers around the United States received bomb threats on Tuesday, including in Milwaukee, Miami, Portland, Oregon; Rochester, New York; and the DC metro area, the Huffington Post reported.

Law enforcement personnel are responding. More details to come.  ADL (@ADL_National) March 7, 2017  The incidents mark the sixth wave of such threats since early January, bringing the total to around 100, according to Mark Potok, an expert on extremism and hate crimes at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Headstones have also been vandalized in at least three Jewish cemeteries around the country. On Friday, a troubled ex-journalist was arrested in connection with threats against eight Jewish community centers, although he appeared to be a copycat and federal law enforcement officials told the New York Times that he was not believed to be behind most of the threats.  Potok sees a disturbing new trend. \"I've been doing this work for almost 20 years now and I haven't seen anything like this in terms of a sustained campaign of bomb threats,\" he says. \"The cemetery desecrationsthat's more of the kind of thing we see in Europe, in countries like Poland and Estonia, where there's a lot of residual anti-Semitism,\" he added.

The number of active hate groups in the US rose to a near-historic high of 917 in 2016, according to a tally by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Sessions, who is now the nation's top law enforcement official, said he's only read summaries of the two reports, according to Reuters, and, apparently, he found no reason to read on. \"Some of it was pretty anecdotal and not so scientifically based,\" he commented.  \"The fact that Sessions hasn't even bothered to read those reports suggests to me that he has no interest in ensuring that law enforcement comply with the Constitution.\"  The conclusions drawn by the DOJ following its investigation of the Ferguson Police Department were far from \"anecdotal.\" The report found that African Americans accounted for 93 percent of arrests made by Ferguson police despite being just 67 percent of the city's population; that black residents were more than twice as likely to have their cars searched during traffic stops despite being more than 25 percent less likely to be caught with contraband than white drivers; and that some discretionary citations like \"walking in roadways\" were issued nearly exclusively to black people.  While the DOJ's report on the Chicago Police Department didn't include the same sort of of statistical analysis on racial disparities, it too was based on much more than scattered \"anecdotal\" evidence. Per the Chicago report, DOJ investigators \"reviewed thousands of pages of documents\" on the department's \"policies, procedures, [and] training plans, [as well as] Department orders and memos, internal and external reports, and more.\" The DOJ also conducted hundreds of interviews with police officers, city officials, and community leaders and members. When the report was released, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters that the abuses committed by Chicago officers disproportionately impacted residents of color. Here's some of what the DOJ found regarding Chicago's police force:  Deadly force was used disproportionately against black residents.  Only 1-in-6 recent graduates of the police academy interviewed by the DOJ \"came close\" to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force.  Chicago's police review board received more than 30,000 police misconduct complaints over the five years reviewed by the DOJ, but fewer than 2 percent of those were sustained or resulted in discipline. During that same period, CPD investigated 409 police shootings, but found only two to be unjustified.  White residents were three-and-half times more likely to have an allegation of police misconduct sustained than black residents. White residents were six times more likely to have their use-of-force complaints sustained than Latino residents.  A 2016 review of the department's dashboard cameras conducted by the department itself found that the audio capability for 80 percent of the cameras were either not working or had been tampered with.  Officers commonly colluded to cover up wrongdoing by their colleagues, and officers facing misconduct investigations were coached by union attorneys in a manner \"experts had [not] seen to nearly such an extent in other agencies.\"  Officers routinely picked up and questioned known gang members about drug activity and dropped them off in rival gang territory if they did not cooperate, putting their lives at greater risk.  Jonathan Smith, an official in the DOJ's Civil Rights Division under Obama, called Sessions' admission that he has not read the Chicago or Ferguson reports \"extremely troubling.\"  \"Chicago and Ferguson are two of the most important investigations done by the Civil Rights Division,\" said Smith, who oversaw the investigations as head of the division's Special Litigations Section. \"The fact that Sessions hasn't even bothered to read those reports suggests to me that he has no interest in ensuring that law enforcement comply with the Constitution.\"  Sessions' ignorance on the DOJ's investigation into the Chicago Police Department apparently reaches beyond the content of the report, however. In January, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin (D) told a reporter that when he met with Sessions that month, Sessions said he was not even aware that the Chicago Police Department was under investigation by the DOJ in the first place. The investigation was launched following the November 2015 release of videowhich recieved national media attentionshowing a Chicago police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, killing him.  Sessions also said on Monday his department hadn't yet decided whether it would pursue a consent decree with the Chicago Police Department mandating reformsa process that had been initiated under the Obama administration.

Two other executive orders signed by Trump earlier this month, focused on fighting crime, have gotten less attentionbut sections of them also appear to target America's immigrant population, a former Justice Department official says.  Trump's executive order concerning crime reduction and public safety instructs the Department of Justice to establish a new task force to crack down on illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime. Among its duties will be to \"identify deficiencies\" in existing laws, make legislative recommendations, and improve data collection on crime trends. Another Trump order, focused on combating international cartels that conduct human trafficking and drug smuggling, directs the DOJ to develop a strategy against these groups that \"have spread throughout the nation\" and \"have been known to commit brutal murders [and] rapes,\" driving \"crime, corruption, violence, and misery.\"  Thomas Abt, a criminologist at the Harvard Kennedy School and the former chief of staff for the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs, says these executive orders involve the usual activities of the DOJ, but also imply strategic priorities that are misguided and troubling. \"Here in the United States, I think a connection between immigrationlegal or illegaland violent crime is not one that there's any evidence for,\" says Abt. One order suggests that increased drug trafficking by cartels is responsible for a \"resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime,\" but there's little evidence to support that, says Abt. He notes that the current opioid and heroine crisis took hold well before the recent spike in violent crime in some US cities.  There is also no evidence to suggest that cartels are more active in the US now than they have been historically. And while mayhem from the drug cartels ravages Mexico and central American countries, and is played up by anti-immigration pundits, violence in the US connected to the cartels is nowhere near that scale. Research published in 2015, for example, found that even at the height of cartel violence in 2010, there was \"no notable increase\" in crime along the US side of the border that correlated with the spike in murders in Mexico.  \"The way it's being framed as this new Bogeyman is just not accurate,\" Abt says. Moreover, the executive orders \"suggest that what's coming next is not a smart, data-driven approach to these issues. They suggest the beginning of a fear-based effort.\"  Abt sees a potential return to 1980s and 1990s tough-on-crime policieschampioned by Attorney General Jeff Sessionsthat have been eschewed as ineffective by leading crime reduction experts. With the call to \"assess\" the allocation of money and resources to federal agencies' for fighting international criminal orgs, Abt also says there could be a shifting of resources by the Trump administration from proven crime-reduction efforts to ideologically based efforts.  Perhaps most troubling, Abt says, is a Trump directive to publish a quarterly report on the criminal convictions of people involved with international criminal organizations. This could be used as a pretext to discriminate against immigrantssimilar to how the threat of terrorism is being used to justify banning travel by immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority countries.  \"It's clearly designed to marshal public opinion,\" Abt says. \"This is Willy-Horton-style, everybody-get-scared type of politics.\"", "date": "2017/02/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-excutive-orders-policing-crime-justice-department-immigrants", "title": "Trump's Other Executive Orders That May Target Immigrants"}, {"text": "A December march in New York City protesting the election of Donald Trump.  Donald Trump repeatedly expressed hostility towards Black Lives Matter activists during his presidential campaign, particularly for their efforts to confront police brutality. Now, faced with a Trump agenda whose repercussions for African Americans could reach far beyond policing, BLM organizers say they are broadly expanding their mission.  Ever since a police officer killed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Black Lives Matter movement has grown into a loose-knit web of like-minded groups nationwide that focus primarily on ending police brutality and the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans. Last August, a coalition of nearly 30 BLM groups, known as the United Front, released a policy platform calling for comprehensive police and criminal justice reforms, economic investments in black communities, and the mobilization of black voters. The shock of Trump's election has turbocharged their sense of urgency.  Trump's election, says a BLM leader, represents \"an escalation of the war on black bodies and lives.\"  Trump's immigration order barring refugees and immigrants in particular \"changed the rules of engagement,\" says Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Oakland-based Center for Media Justice, part of the United Front. The new president's agenda, she says, represents \"an escalation of the war on black bodies and lives.\" Approximately a quarter of Muslims in America are black, she notes; Trump's order blocked immigrants from the African countries of Sudan, Libya, and Somalia, among others. \"The issue is the culture that gets created that is anti-Muslim, anti-black, anti-brown, anti-woman,\" she says.  \"We have tons of black folks that are going to be affected by the potential cutting of DACA,\" says Dante Barry, director of New York City-based Million Hoodies for Justice, referring to Trump's plan to crack down on undocumented residents. \"We're going to have black folk that are going to be impacted by the cut of the Affordable Care Act.\"  Following Trump's election, I interviewed leaders and local organizers with seven groups participating in the United Front about their plans for confronting the Trump era. I also talked to an organizer with an eighth group, Campaign Zero, whose cofounders include Deray McKesson, perhaps the movement's most visible organizer. All of these activists reiterated that police and criminal justice reform will remain a priority, but that other issues have become equally urgent.  In the wake of Trump's immigration order, BLM organizers mobilized their networks to turn out at airports to protest. The groups also fired up their social media networks to amplify calls for the release of detained travelers. BLM leaders say their strategy will evolve as more details become known about what Trump plans to do on matters ranging from policing and reproductive rights to climate change and LGBT issues. They will focus on combating what they see as Trump's hostile, retrograde agendaand that of right-wing politicians emboldened by Trumpprimarily at the state and local levels.  Immigration concerns are squarely on the radar for Million Hoodies, Barry says. The six current members of the group's chapter in Greensboro, North Carolinaall college studentsare drafting sanctuary campus policies that they plan to pitch to school administrations. The group is also in talks with at least one other local group about how Million Hoodies can bolster their efforts to protect undocumented residents throughout Greensboro. Last fall, Million Hoodies Greensboro also supported a local campaign to repeal North Carolina's infamous anti-LGBT bathroom bill. \"We just show up when folks need support,\" member Delaney Vandergrift told me. \"Showing up at protests and community meetings. Amplifying on social media. Making signs. Anything that local organizations already doing the work are asking for.\"  \"The crises are so large that we have to have the capacity to address more than one thing at a time.\"  Patrisse Cullors, cofounder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, said her organization of nearly 40 chapters plans to expand its work on reproductive rights from a handful of southern US cities to other parts of country. The network hopes to replicate work like that of its chapter in Louisville, Kentucky, which is part of a repro-rights coalition that meets monthly and includes Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Kentucky. This week, following the opening of the Kentucky legislature's next session, members from BLM Louisville and its partners plan to go to the statehouse in Frankfort to lobby against a bill that would require women to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion, according to Chanelle Helm, an organizer with the chapter. In the upcoming legislative session the group also plans to lobby against a Kentucky bill that would make assaulting a police officer a \"hate crime.\"  Shortly before Trump's inauguration, Campaign Zero rolled out a Trump Resistance Manual, broadening its focus on data gathering beyond police reform. The site includes descriptions of various Trump policy proposals and assessments of their potential impact; it encourages users to crowd-source information about ways people can get involved in local organizing around more than a dozen issues, including police reform, LGBT rights, education, and climate change.  \"The crises are so large that we have to have the capacity to address more than one thing at a time,\" said Sam Sinyangwe, a co-founder of the group. \"In this moment when they're trying to take away health care from 30 million people, we simply cannot ignore that in the interest of focusing on one issue.\"  Still, police reform remains crucial, and efforts at the state and local levels will be key. The new political reality of a Republican-controlled White House and Congress narrows the prospects for federal criminal justice reform, and leadership from the Department of Justice on police reform, as was the case under President Obama. \"We have a federal governmentand when I say the federal government I mean [prospective] Attorney General Jeff Sessionswho doesn't believe in consent decrees,\" said Barry, referring to the DOJ interventions mandating reform for troubled local police departments. \"So I think particularly the Trump administration is not going to be useful or helpful for our communities.\"  Trump has praised stop-and-frisk and the broken-windows policing strategy, both widely considered racially discriminatory. A budget blueprint for the next fiscal year prepared by the conservative Heritage Foundationa plan mirrored by budget proposals made by the Trump administration, the Hill reportedwould also cut $58 million dollars in funding from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, which handles police investigations.  BLM organizers plan to push for laws that empower state attorneys general to open civil rights investigations into local police departments.  Barry said he expects DOJ work on civil rights investigations into police shooting cases that weren't finished under the Obama administrationsuch as the Eric Garner and John Crawford investigationsto stall. And worrisome for Campaign Zero's Sinyangwe is the prospect that, under Trump, the DOJ might be more inclined to intervene in cases of police violence in support of law enforcement. \"That's a different situation that we're not accustomed to in terms of [the Civil Rights] division,\" he said.  This year, Campaign Zero will begin pushing for laws that empower state attorneys general to open civil rights investigations into local police departments, as is already the case in California, Sinyangwe said. The group will also push for local laws that require a vote by a city council before a police department can accept military equipment from the federal government. Trump has suggested that he will expand the DOJ program that transfers such equipment to local law enforcement.  BLM leaders aim to capitalize on the energy of the nationwide protests that have unfolded since Trump's election. The local Sacramento chapter of the Black Lives Matter Global Network has canvassed neighborhoods and college campuses five times since the election and has a fast-growing email list, Tanya Faison, the founder of the chapter, told me.  In mid-January, Black Lives Matter groups around the country led multiple protests against pieces of Trump's agenda that target immigrants, Muslims, and other people of color; the effort began on MLK Day and culminated with the mass anti-Trump protests on inauguration day. April Goggans, who is with the Black Lives Matter Global Network chapter in Washington, D.C., said BLM organizers have been \"in awe\" of the throng of supporters for their recent events. \"It's really important to us that every time we have a mobilization, that we have an intentional thing to call people into next,\" Goggans said. \"The days of just rallying and going home are over because there's a lot of work that needs to be done.\"  During the week of the inauguration, BLM groups hosted \"Know Your Rights\" trainings and \"teach-ins\" on Trump's agenda, among other efforts to educate and involve more supporters. In collaboration with the ACLU and the National Lawyers Guild, Goggans' chapter held trainings that walked attendees through everything from protest permit laws in DC to what a person's rights are when police give a dispersal order, and how to conduct yourself in jail if you do ultimately get arrested.  The Black Lives Matter Global Network has raised nearly $14,000 in support of the protest efforts at Standing Rock.  Goggans' chapter plans to rally supporters this month to canvas in neighborhoods in southeast D.C.an area shaken by increased gun violence in recent years, and where Goggans livesto encourage people to oppose a push by the city's mayor to hire more police as a key solution to violent crime. The plan is to talk to residents about initiatives like after school programs and donating books to schools, and \"to listen to folks and ask, 'What is your biggest concern about this? Or what things do you think will be helpful for the issue happening on your block or in your community?' So that it's not just giving information, it's a sharing of information.\"  Building that people power will benefit from more collaboration and resource sharing with non-BLM groups. Even before Trump's election, some BLM groups had begun to build such coalitions. Last fall, some sent members to North Dakota to support Native American activists fighting against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, while others raised money and provided supplies for native activists on the front lines there. The Black Lives Matter Global Network has raised nearly $14,000 in support of the protest efforts at Standing Rock.  The potential for powerful grassroots alliances has only grown since Trump entered the Oval Office, BLM leaders say. \"What we saw during the inauguration weekend is going to continue,\" said Barry of the historic marches around the country involving myriad activist groups. \"We're all under attack. Each of us might be impacted very differently, but we now share a very similar political fate, and so it's incumbent on all of us to really be in full coordination and solidarity with other movements.\"", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/black-lives-matter-versus-trump", "title": "How the Black Lives Matter Movement Is Mobilizing Against Trump"}, {"text": "After every major LGBT rights group in America campaigned in support of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton, it came as little surprise that Trump won just 14 percent of the LGBT vote on November 8. Yet, one of Trump's most vocal and controversial cheerleaders has been a gay man, political provocateur and Breibart News writer Milo Yiannopolous. Yiannopolouswho has penned columns such as \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\" and \"The Conservative Father's Guide to Cutting Off Activist Children\"repeatedly made headlines last year for his inflammatory rhetoric. At his gays-for-Trump event at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last summer, Yiannopolous argued the Democratic Party was \"nannying us about transgender pronouns\" while \"pander[ing] to an ideology that wants me dead\"his take on Islam as an anti-gay religion. He declared Trump \"the most pro-gay candidate in American electoral history,\" arguing Trump would be great for gay people.  Last July, Yiannopolous was banned from Twitter after inciting his followers to make racist attacks against black actress Leslie Jones. More recently, he mocked a transgender student at a college campus where he was giving a speech. Stops on Yiannopolous' campus tour have regularly been met with protests and calls for university administrations to cancel his appearances.  When gay magazine Out put Yiannopolous on its cover last summer, the backlash was fierce and swiftespecially from LGBT people of color, who recognized all too well the dangers of \"normalizing\" champions of bigotry.  So how should queer folk react to Yiannopolous' hatred, and what can we do to combat it? I talked to Preston Mitchum, an LGBT rights and racial justice advocate, to find out. Mitchumwhose writing has appeared in The Atlantic, the Huffington Post, Ebony, and moreis also a policy analyst at the Center for Health and Gender Equity and a legal research professor at Georgetown University.  What follows is our conversation about racism and sexism in the LGBT community, and what queer solidarity looks like in the face of hatred.  Mother Jones: Milo is an admitted troll, and his rhetoric is over-the-top. Should we even take him seriously?  Preston Mitchum: Queer people of color have always taken those kinds of hateful ideasand the actions that flow therefromseriously. Bias is not new to the LGBT community. Our community is racist, sexist, and transphobic. But Milo feels different because of the extreme nature of his statements. His views aren't common. But he is setting the stage for what vitriol can look like in the community if left unchecked.  MJ: Queer folkeven white onesare marginalized too. Why would some be receptive to ideas like Milo's?  \"Milo feels different because of the extreme nature of his statements. His views aren't common.\"  PM: Racism, sexism, and transphobia are foundational to this country. Queer people didn't invent them, but we can't separate them from the LGBT community. We internalize what we see every day. I think about people like Ben Carson, who pushes ideas that have been popularized by racists. We also learn from our experiences. So Milo being a gay man does not mean that he's going to believe everything that I believe, because I am a black man who experiences racism and homophobia at the same time. Milo doesn't have that experience. Part of fixing this is to first recognize that we are predisposed to discrimination and then intentionally work to undo what we have been taught about racism and misogyny.  MJ: A lot of people don't get that.  PM: They don't. They might understand what their own oppression looks like as a white gay man, but systemically that looks different for someone who is a woman and black and gay. People who are part of multiple marginalized communities face harsher treatment just because of their intersections. Many people don't understand privilege. What's worse is they don't recognize that they contribute to other queer people's oppression, either. The same goes for a lot of mainstream white-led LGBT organizations.  MJ: Talk about that.  PM: Mainstream white individuals and white-led organizations are oftentimes the ones who sweep statements like Milo's under the rug. A lot of it has to do with responding to donors' demands. If your donors are sending you money to advocate for marriage equality, that's what you're going to do. But there are other communities who also need the support of those groups but who have been made invisible because they don't have the money to give them to focus on their needs. It's incumbent on those organizations who say they care about all LGBT people to find it within their capacity to still do work on behalf of black and brown LGBT people even if they're not paying for it. That's what solidarity looks like.  In the past few years, I've noticed a more concerted effort to address certain racism, certain violence against black trans peoplemainly black trans women. But I'm ready to see what that can look like big picture. What does it look like to have a black trans person on your board? What does it look like when you are actually starting something separate for black trans people in your organization? That is what I have yet to see.  At the start of the Black Lives Matter movement, which was led immediately by black queer and trans folk, you didn't hear much from many white-led LGBT organizations, which was frustrating because a lot of the immediate leaders of the movement were black queer and trans people. And earlier than that, when there was a campaign to repeal DOMA and Don't Ask Don't Tell, many white-led orgs sought the support of the NAACP. But when the crux of the Voting Rights Act was struck down by the Supreme Court that same year, there was silence from those same groups. I talked to people in LGBT organizations who were immediately defensive when that critique was brought to their attention. We have to be willing to have these conversations about racism that require us to be critiqued.  MJ: Why are those conversations difficult to have?  We have to be honest about what's happening within our own community if we want to push back against Trump.  PM: Part of the problem is that progressives are so focused on unifying against conservatives. Unity is good, but it often silences more marginalized groups. We have to be honest about what's happening within our own community if we want to push back against Trump. It's easy to point out people who don't identify as you and say, \"You're the bad person here.\" It's more difficult to look within our own community and say, \"We identify and have some common ground, but there's something about you that I know is vehemently opposed to me.\"  MJ: How has this bias been manifest within the LGBT community historically?  PM: It's hard to say. LGBT people have vocally been discussed only for the past 40 years. But even in that, the way we talk about our history is racist. Only in the past couple years have we started to mention some of the black and Puerto Rican trans women who were really at the start of Stonewall. Or acknowledge people like Bayard Rustin, who was the architect of the 1963 March on Washington. We know that is the whitewashing of history. LGBT history is no different.  MJ: How are queer people of color pushing back on that exclusionand how can the larger community root out the bias that drives that exclusion?  PM: Black Youth Project 100which I'm a part ofhas been challenging that erasure of black queer and trans folk for the past two and a half to three years, and making sure that people who are marginalized within the LGBT community are centered and that work is done to organize around their needs. There are others doing this work. But there are things that everyone can doand that many people have been doing. One is to come prepared with information to push back on racist and sexist rhetoric. Social media is a huge way people have been doing that. Black and brown people also need to be very blunt about how oppression treats us as queer and trans folk.  One of the things that I always want to discuss is believing the experiences of people of color. We often aren't believed until a white person confirms our stories. I would also encourage people to donate money to organizations that do this work. That's what people can do to help fix the problem.", "date": "2017/01/14", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/lgbt-trump-milo-yiannopolous-racism-preston-mitchum", "title": "How the LGBT Community Can Fight Back Against Trump"}, {"text": "Officers standing watch in November 2015 during a protest over the police shooting of Laquan McDonald  The US Department of Justice on Friday released a scathing report concluding a 13-month investigation into the conduct of the Chicago Police Department, finding rampant uses of excessive force and other abuses. The investigation was launched in November 2015 after the release of video showing a white officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing the youth who was armed with a knife. The Justice Department reviewed documents related to the Chicago PD's training policies and procedures and reviewed reports and investigative files for nearly 600 police-shooting and use-of-force incidents between January 2011 and April 2016. It also interviewed community members, city officials, hundreds of police officers, and investigators with the city's independent police review board. Key findings from the report include:  Chicago police officers routinely used unreasonable forceincluding deadly force. Officers engaged in tactics that made the need to use force more likely or more risky, such as engaging in unnecessary foot pursuits and shooting at moving vehicles, the report says. In one incident, officers drove up to a man on the street and ordered him to freeze because he was fidgeting with his waistband. The man ran and three officers chased him, shooting as they ran. The officers fired a total of 45 rounds in the pursuit, in which the suspect was killed.

The Internal Police Review Boardtasked with investigating police misconduct until Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel overhauled the agency last yearfound just 2 of the 409 shootings that occurred in the period covered by the DOJ's investigation to be unjustified. And even though Chicago paid more than $500 million in judgments in misconduct cases since 2004, it conducted disciplinary investigations into fewer than half of them. When cases were investigated, the report notes, witnesses and officers often were interviewed long after the incidents occurred, or never at all; officers were heavily coached by union attorneys; and some officers colluded to cover up misconduct.

When cases were investigated, the report notes, witnesses and officers often were interviewed long after the incidents occurred, or never at all; officers were heavily coached by union attorneys; and some officers colluded to cover up misconduct. Training in Chicago's police academy is insufficient to train recruits to modern standards. In one training that DOJ investigators sat in on, recruits were instructed with a video that was 35 years old, predating Supreme Court decisions that altered use-of-force standards, the report says. The instruction was also inconsistent with police department's own use-of-force policy, the report said.  Notably absent from the DOJ's report is an assessment of whether Chicago cops disproportionately target people of colorwhich the DOJ has repeatedly found with investigations of other cities' police forces. Asked about this during a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch acknowledged that the abuses outlined in the report had a greater impact on minority neighborhoods. The report also discussed how distrust between police and communities of color affected Chicago's skyrocketing murder rate, noting that the tension made it harder for police to investigate shootings. (Chicago police have made significantly fewer stops and arrests in Chicago in 2015, which President-elect Donald Trump and some city authorities have attributed to increased scrutiny on officers and blamed for the worsening gun violence.)  The release of the report and the agreement reached between the DOJ and Chicago officials, in which both parties agreed to work toward reforms, were reportedly finalized in a hurry, due to concern that the process would stall under the incoming Trump administration. Both Trump and his attorney general pick, Jeff Sessions, have been critical of federal involvement in local policing issues. Asked if the DOJ's agreement with Chicago would stick after the change in administration, Lynch said the agreement was not dependent upon \"one or two or three\" people who lead the DOJ, but on the work of all involved in the process, including Chicago city officials. Chicago Mayor Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson both said they were committed to making sure the reform recommendations made by the DOJ were implemented.  The DOJ announced yesterday that it had also reached a consent decree with the Baltimore Police Department, five months after concluding its investigation into that department following protests over the in-custody death of Freddie Gray.

When federal inspectors stopped by the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange County, California, for a surprise check-in last November, they found spoiled meat and broken telephones, showers laced with mold, and immigrants held in solitary confinement for 24 hours a day. That's according to a horrific report released Monday by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, laying out serious health and safety risks for detained immigrants held in the facility.  The 3,442-bed jail holds convicted criminals, but its operator, the Orange County Sheriff's Department, also has a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to incarcerate detained immigrantsaround 478 people at the time of the inspection. The detainees, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime, are held while they await deportation or for a hearing to determine their legal status.  Here's what the OIG watchdogs found:  24-hour solitary confinement: Detainees who broke facility rules were placed in Special Management Unit, \"commonly known as solitary confinement,\" according to the report. There they were confined to a cell for 24 hours a day, without access to visitors, recreation, a telephone, or religious services. They were allowed one book for their stay, which could last up to 30 days in total.

In 2012, the Detention Watch Networkan advocacy group that opposes immigration detentionreleased a report alleging that immigrants were subjected to physical and psychological abuse by staff, among other complaints.

Immigration agents sparked panic across the country last week, when a series of high-profile operations made it clear that a new era of crackdowns on undocumented immigrants had begun. Coming on the heels of a couple of major executive orders on immigration, the arrests and deportations were a very public reminder of President Donald Trump's promise to deport upwards of 2 million immigrants upon taking office.  But given that America's detention system for immigrants has been running at full capacity for some time now, where is the president going to put all of these people before deporting them?  In new jails, for starters. In the same executive order that called for the construction of a southern border wall, Trump instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build out its sprawling network of immigration detention centers. Starting \"immediately,\" his order said, ICE should construct new facilities, lease space for immigrants alongside inmates in existing local jails, and sign new contractslikely with private prison companies. The scale of that expansion became clearer on February 5, when the Los Angeles Times reported on a memo handed down in late January from White House immigration experts to top Homeland Security officials. The document called for raising the number of immigrants ICE incarcerates daily, nationwide, to 80,000 people.  In late January, a memo to top Homeland Security officials called for raising the number of immigrants ICE incarcerates daily to 80,000 people.  Last year, ICE detained more than 352,000 people. The number of detainees held each day, typically between 31,000 and 34,000, reached a historic high of about 41,000 people in the fall, as Customs and Border Protection apprehended more people on the southwest border while seeing a simultaneous rise in asylum seekers. But doubling the daily capacity to 80,000 \"would require ICE to sprint to add more capacity than the agency has ever added in its entire history,\" says Carl Takei, staff attorney for the ACLU's National Prison Project. It would also take an extra $2 billion in government funding per year, detention experts interviewed by Mother Jones estimated. And, Takei warned, \"we don't know if 80,000 is where he'll stop.\"  Yet even if ICE does not adopt an 80,000-person detention quota, other changes laid out in Trump's executive orders suggest that vastly more people will be detained in the coming months and years. For example, Trump ordered ICE to prioritize deporting not only immigrants who been convicted or charged with crimes, but also those who had \"committed acts that constitute a chargeable offense\"a category that could include entering the country illegally and driving without a license. Trump also ordered Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who oversees ICE, to take \"all appropriate actions\" to detain undocumented immigrants while their cases are pending.  Beyond that, ICE could stop granting parole to asylum seekers, explains Margo Schlanger, a former Obama administration official who served as Homeland Security's top authority on civil rights. With ICE taking enforcement action against more categories of immigration offenders and releasing fewer of them, Schlanger says, \"we could get to a very large sum of people in detention very quickly.\"  It's not difficult to guess who profits. In an earnings call last week, the private prison giant CoreCivic (formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America, or CCA) announced that it saw the ICE detention expansion as a business opportunity. \"When coupled with the above average rate of crossings along the southwest border, these executive orders appear likely to significantly increase the need for safe, humane, and appropriate detention bed capacity that we have available,\" CoreCivic President and CEO Damon Hininger said.  \"There's little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what's going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.\"  As of November, a whopping 65 percent of ICE detainees were held in facilities run by private prison companies, which typically earn a fee per detainee per night and whose business model depends upon minimizing costs to return profits to their shareholders. Since Trump's election, private prison stocks have soared, and two new, for-profit detention centers are opening in Georgia and Texas.  Another private prison company, Management & Training Corp., is reportedly seeking a contract with ICE to reopen the Willacy County Correctional Institution, a troubled detention camp that held up to 2,000 ICE detainees in Kevlar tents between 2006 and 2011. \"Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded,\" Takei says. \"There's little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what's going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.\"  The first new detention center contracts will likely take the form of arrangements between ICE and local governments to reopen empty prison facilities as detention centers or rent beds in existing local jails, Takei says. The arrangements, known intergovernmental service agreements, allow ICE to cut deals with local governments and private prison companies while avoiding a lengthy public bidding process. Occasionally, the local government agrees to hold ICE detainees alongside inmates in their publicly run jailan arrangement a Department of Homeland Security subcommittee recently called \"the most problematic\" option for holding detainees. But most of the time, local governments simply act as middlemen in deals between ICE and private prison companies.  The opaque nature of the process allows all parties to avoid public outcry before the deals are signed, explains Silky Shah, co-director of the Detention Watch Network, an immigrant rights advocacy group. So far, immigration advocates haven't gotten wind of many new contracts being negotiated or signed since Trump's inauguration. \"But that doesn't mean contracting activity is not taking place,\" Takei says. \"I suspect there are closed-door meetings taking place across the country right now.\"  \"There are a lot of bad things that happen if the number of beds is ramped up fast, without appropriate controls, monitoring, supervision, and care_Detainees could die.\"  Expanding detention quickly could have a high human cost. Schlanger is worried that conditions inside detention facilities could deteriorate without proper oversight from the Department of Homeland Security. \"There are a lot of bad things that happen if the number of beds is ramped up fast, without appropriate controls, monitoring, supervision, and care,\" she says, pointing to the potential overuse of solitary confinement, inadequate safety measures, poor nutrition, and insufficient medical care. \"That means detainees could die.\" Asylum seekers, she warns, will have a harder time fighting their immigration cases from inside detention centers, where it's difficult to access lawyers and gather evidence. More could be coerced into voluntary deportation: \"You're vulnerable to the government saying to you, 'Look, we'll let you out from detention, but you have to give up your immigration case.'\"  We don't have to look far in the past to see the danger of rushing to open new detention facilities. Last year, as several thousand Haitian immigrants arrived on the southern border, fleeing natural disasters and poverty, the Department of Homeland Security began seeking contracts for new detention facilities to accommodate the surge. In their scramble to secure space for the new arrivals, ICE officials reportedly considered ignoring quality standards for the facilities\"scraping the bottom looking for beds,\" as one official told the Wall Street Journal.  The bottom of the barrel, in this case, included a prison in Cibola County, New Mexico, owned by CoreCivic. Last summer, after an investigation by The Nation revealed a pattern of severe, longtime medical neglect in the 1,100-bed facilitywhich had gone months without a doctorthe US Bureau of Prisons decided to pull its inmates out and cancel its contract with CoreCivic. Yet less than a month after the last federal prisoner was transferred out, ICE was already negotiating an agreement with the county and CoreCivic to detain immigrants in the newly vacant facility. Four hundred immigrants are currently detained there. Takei notes that ICE contracted with the same company, for the same prison: \"There werent any substantive changes.\"  Shah expects to see familiar problems like poor medical care worsen as new deals for detention facilities are finalized. \"One of the concerns we hear most often is that when people complain about ailments, [officers] will come back and just say, 'Well, drink more water, or take an Advil and you'll be fine,'\" she says. \"It's a really harsh system already. If you're going to expand at this level, it's just going to become that much harsher.\"", "date": "2017/02/21", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trumps-immigration-detention-center-expansion", "title": "The Private Prison Industry Is Licking Its Chops Over Trump's Deportation Plans"}, {"text": "Khudeeda Rashowka Naif and his family, from Iraq, were preparing to leave their refugee camp for the airport when Trumps executive order came down.  For thousands of US-bound refugees worldwide, President Donald Trump's so-called \"Muslim ban\" has thrown their future into question. Now that refugees are not allowed to come to the United States for 120 daysand Syrian refugees are barred indefinitelyresettlement workers are scrambling to figure out what will happen to these people fleeing war, persecution, and disaster in their home countries.  Trump's executive order affects both refugees in the middle of the screening process and those already approved for resettlement in the United States, according to Sarah Krause, senior director of immigration and refugee programs for Church World Service, which operates one of the nine global resettlement support centers for US-bound refugees. \"For someone to get referral to the US refugee admissions program is a feat,\" says Krause, whose organization helped with the resettlement of about 28,000 people from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States last year. \"For them to have made it through the process and been approved is even more incredible. That they have gone through all of that and we are now shutting the door on them is unconscionable.\"  In addition to its temporary freeze on resettlement, the order caps total incoming refugees for the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000 peopleless than half of what the Obama administration had planned. More than 32,000 have already been resettled. For the 872 refugees already set to travel to the United States this weekincluding those from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yementhe government has granted a temporary grace period. Those refugees will be allowed to enter the country until Friday. For those scheduled to enter the United States after Friday, their flights have been canceled.  Here's what Krause sees as the most pressing issues facing the refugees left behind by Trump's order:  People have been left without housing or their possessions. \"These are individuals who, in many cases, have already sold their belongings in order to have some money upon entering to the United States,\" Krause says. \"Many of them knew their final destinationthe cities to which they would be resettled. In Kenya, refugees coming from the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps are brought into Nairobi prior to their departure for the United States. There they stay at the [International Organization for Migration transit] center, where they receive predeparture medical screenings as well as cultural orientation, where they learn about life in the United States. Currently, there are over 120 refugees in the IOM transfer center who were expecting to board flights this week and who are now being told they will be sent back to the camp. For those refugees, they have already given up their shelters to new refugee arrivals, and sold their belongings. Their future is very uncertain.\"  Refugees already approved for US entry may need to restart parts of the resettlement processa delay of months or years. \"Their cases remain in processing,\" she says. \"Some of their clearances will expire during this 120-day period and will need to be re-requested. There are checks that are requested by the resettlement support centers: [security opinions], interagency checks, as well as fingerprints. It is a challenge to line all those clearances up, which means the window for departure is very small. Once that window closes, it's difficult to open again.\"  Refugees from the seven banned countries were left stranded. \"For those that had already been booked for travel, their flights have been canceled,\" Krause says. \"Processing has essentially halted. [They] are not in their home country, they're in countries of asylum, and the conditions in those countries are often very difficult. Some refugees make it to urban centers but live on very little and are not permitted by the countries in which they're residing to work. Others are living in camps with hundreds of thousands of other people. Our Somali refugeesmost of them have been in exile since 1990. You have generations of Somalis that have never been to Somalia.\"  Officials are trying to prioritize refugees in particularly dangerous circumstances. The executive order allows for some refugees to be admitted on a case-by-case basis, Krause says. \"We're working with the Department of State to compile a list of the most vulnerable cases, although at this point the process for seeking exemptions is not yet clear. This is a life-saving program, and a delay of even a day for some cases could mean death in a case of extreme medical need or protection issues. There are some who are being moved from safe house to safe house by UNHCR because they are being hunted by their persecutors. I know of a gay Somali man who is currently in a safe house and who has been attacked. He is one of those cases in our pipeline.\"  But for others, there's little hope of finding another home now that the United States has shut its doors. \"For those for whom we don't believe exemptions can be sought, or it may take too long, we will look at pulling those cases out and giving them back to UNHCR for referral to another resettlement country. While the US accepts less than 1 percent of the world's refugee population, we take more than any other. So it is unlikely that any other countries will have the capacity to take those that we cannot. And other countries have their own processes. That will take time.\"  This story has been updated with more recent resettlement numbers and to accurately reflect the refugees affected by the grace period.", "date": "2017/02/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/heres-what-happens-refugees-left-behind-trumps-travel-ban", "title": "Here's the Hell Trump's Order Created for Refugees Overseas"}, {"text": "Trump campaigns in Iowa, August, 2016.  American farms overflow with certain foods: Our almond, corn, soybean, cotton, and wheat farms, and hog, chicken, and beef feedlots all churn out more than we can eat, wear, or burn in our cars as biofuel. That's why industrial-scale US agriculture needs robust and growing export markets. During the campaign, Donald Trump courted support from these agribusiness interests, assembling a 60-plus-person advisory panel of farm-state politicians and industry flacks, and thundering from the stump against the \"radical regulation\" of farms.  But on the question of trade, Trump strayed far from his flock of agribiz supporters, lashing out against the very deals that Big Ag has been pushing for a generation and trash-talking China, a prized destination for our farm goods. In the first days of his presidency, Trump has already shown he meant business. He formally removed the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive deal hotly supported by Big Ag that would link the United States with 11 nations on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. And he vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, two of the biggest foreign buyers of our farmed goods.  The countries that Trump most directly targeted in his trade tirades, Mexico and China, are two of the three biggest export markets for our farmed products.  He has also initiated a fight with Mexico over his beloved border wallone that threatened to bloom into a full trade war on Thursday afternoon when White House spokesman Sean Spicer dangled the idea of collecting funds to pay for the barrier by imposing a 20 percent tax on all imports. Spicer's statements were widely misreported: He never mentioned a tax specifically targeting Mexico, and he quickly walked back the idea anyway.  But if we did get sucked into a US-Mexico trade war, the consequences would be massive on both sides of the border. The United States imports nearly a third of the fruit and vegetables we consume, and Mexico accounts for 44 percent of that foreign-grown cornucopia, much more than any other country. It's by far our biggest supplier of avocados, sending us more than 90 percent of the Hass varietals we consume, and it also delivers loads of tomatoes and peppersmeaning that in the event of a trade war, your guacamole could become very dear, indeed.  For Mexico, the stakes are even higher. As Greg Grandin, a professor of history at New York University, recently noted, NAFTA \"destroyed the Mexican farming industry, transforming what is left of it into the production of specialty crops to meet the all-season US demand for strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes.\" Mexico now relies heavily on imports of US wheat, corn, and soybeans. A major disruption in supply could trigger price spikes in these commodities, leading higher prices for staples like tortillas and meat in a country already being roiled by protests over rising gas prices.  Amid the tumult, US agricultural players are freaking out, and for good reason. The countries that Trump most directly targeted in his trade tirades during the campaign, Mexico and China, are two of the three biggest export markets for farmed products. The third biggest market is Canadathe country that joins the United States and Mexico in NAFTA. According to Joseph Glauber, who served as chief economist at the US Department of Agriculture under most of Obama's presidency, US agriculture exports to China, Mexico, and Canada averaged $63 billion annually between 2013 and 2015accounting for 44 percent of total food/ag US exports.  For soybeans and pork, two of the most valuable US ag export products, the reliance is particularly stark. The United States is the world's largest soybean producer, and our farms export nearly half of what they harvest. The biggest recipients are China and Mexico, which together account for nearly 70 percent of US soybean exports, buying a total of about $16.6 billion worth of the product. They also make up two of the top three destinations for US pork.  In an apparent attempt to ease agribiz concerns about China, Trump back in December appointed Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who has been promoting his states' soybeans, corn, and pork to China for decades, as ambassador to that country. But Mexico and the TPP countrieswhich include Canada and major US pork and beef buyers Japan and South Korearemain in his cross-hairs.  \"Believe me, we're going to have a lot of trade deals,\" Trump told a group of Republican legislators.  The American Farm Bureau Federation, which promotes the interests of corporate agribusiness, expressed dismay over Trump's rejection of the TPP, mourning it as a \"positive agreement that would add $4.4 billion annually to the struggling agriculture economy\" and requesting that Trump commit to \"ensuring we do not lose the ground gainedwhether in the Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe or other parts of the world.\" Around 130 companies and trade groups, representing virtually the entire US ag industry, signed a letter to Trump on January 23, informing the new president that \"NAFTA has been a windfall for US farmers, ranchers, and food processors,\" and that food and agriculture exports to Canada and Mexico have more than quadrupled since the deal's signing in 1994.  Of course, these groups cannot claim to have been surprised by Trump's trade moveshe made his stance on the issue crystal clear during his campaign. His rural proxies emphasized Trump's anti-regulatory zeal and his vow to end the inheritance tax, a big deal to the American Farm Bureau but not so consequential to most farmers (the USDA estimates it affects less than 1 percent of farms). On trade, they delivered a trust-us message.  In July, when I spoke to Charles Herbster, the multi-level marketing and cattle magnate who chaired Trump's Agricultural and Rural Advisory Committee, he gave me the campaign's spiel. Before vowing Trump would end over-regulation and the reduce the inheritance tax, Herbster tried to square the circle on trade:  Herbster told me that he's been getting calls from farmers \"concerned about issues of trade.\" Herbster said he reassures them that Trump \"is not against trade in any way\"it's \"just that he wants trade to be fair,\" and that means renegotiating trade deals. Herbster acknowledged that \"trade for agriculture in the Midwest has probably been pretty good for the past few years,\" but that it \"hasn't been good for small manufacturers in middle America and the coasts.\" Trump, he suggested, would make trade great again for everyone.  Another prominent Trump rural proxy during the campaign, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, took a similar line, declaring in August that Trump's trade stance could actually benefit US farmers because \"above all, [Trump wants] to be known as the president that cuts the good deals...He's a deal maker, that's his whole mantra.\"  In place of big, multi-national pacts like NAFTA and TPP, Trump has vowed to make multiple bi-lateral trade deals with individuals countries. \"Believe me, we're going to have a lot of trade deals,\" Trump told a gathering of Republican legislators Thursday, Reuters reports. \"If that particular country doesn't treat us fairly, we send them a 30-day termination, notice of termination.\"  Trump and his team \"seem to have a very limited understanding of the complications of negotiating deals,\" says one trade policy analyst.  Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy says Trump may simply not understand that negotiating trade deals is a long and difficult process. \"They want the bi-lateral deals, because it allows them to bully other countries more easily,\" he said. \"But they seem to have a very limited understanding of the complications of negotiating dealsit's an extremely time-consuming process.\"  Of course, the big agribusiness interests don't just prize trade deals because they expand markets for pork and (soy)beans. Deals like NAFTA and the TPP, Lilliston added, also \"allow agribusinesses to set up wherever they want.\" For example, US-based pork behemoth Smithfieldnow, ironically, owned by a Chinese conglomeratedidn't just use NAFTA as a lever to expand pork exports to Mexico; it also dramatically expanded its hog-rearing operations in Mexico in the wake of the deal's onset in 1994, sometimes over the protests of people who live near the hog operations.  US agriculture policy encourages farms to produce as much as possible, even in times of low prices. And since domestic demand rises only at the rate of population growth, these farmers rely on foreign markets to maintain profit growth, points out the former USDA economist Glauber. \"Those facts explain why US agricultural interests have been such strong supporters of free trade agreements in the past,\" he wrote.  Trump managed to win big in the corn and soybean counties of the Midwest, in areas largely reliant on exports. But if he repeals their beloved trade deals without replacing them, these supporters might ultimately give up on Trump.", "date": "2017/01/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-burns-his-big-ag-supporters-trade", "title": "This Industry Just Found Out What It's Like to Do Business in Trump's America"}, {"text": "When Indiana's then-Gov. Mike Pence needed to appoint a new director of his state's agriculture department back in 2013, he dipped right into the corner offices of the global agrichemical industry. His pick, Ted McKinney, then the director of global corporate affairs for Elanco Animal Health, a division of pharma giant Eli Lilly, had previously been an executive on the government affairs team for seed/pesticide giant Dow AgroSciences.  Now Pence is the vice president-elect for the incoming Trump administration, which sorely needs to appoint a secretary of the US Department of Agriculture, the only open Cabinet slot. And McKinney, recently reappointed as director of Indiana's agriculture department, has emerged as the latest in a long line of contenders du jour for the job, Politico reports.  The seed and pesticide industries would certainly have a major ally at the helm of the USDA if McKinney gets the nod.  And now the USDA post is really open: Tom Vilsack, the outgoing USDA chief, abruptly quit Friday, informing employees in an email he had served his final day, Associated Press reports. Vilsack added some damning commentary on Trump's delay in choosing his successor: \"When that individual is named, he or she will be at a tremendous disadvantage, in terms of getting up to speed on all this department does,\" Vilsack said in a statement, according to AP.  Will McKinney be the one Trump chooses for the burden? In his capacity as an Indiana government official, McKinneywho also serves as director of agribusiness development at the Indiana Economic Development Corporationis perhaps best known for helping lead an ultimately unsuccessful but \"very aggressive\" effort to entice DowDuPont to choose Indianapolis as the corporate HQ of its agrichemical arm. McKinney has a well-earned perspective on the advantages of doing agribusiness in Indiana, which sits in the heart of the US corn belt. His most recent private-sector employer, Elanco, is headquartered in the state, as was Dow AgroSciences, until its parent company merged with DuPont last year.  The seed and pesticide industries would certainly have a major ally at the helm of the USDA if McKinney gets the nod. In addition to having worked for Dow for nearly two decades, Mckinney was a co-founder and served as interim executive director for the Council for Biotechnology Information, a group funded by BASF, Bayer, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Monsanto, and Syngenta to promote agriculture biotech. These companies need USDA approval to move novel genetically modified seeds from lab to market. And apparently they have Trump's earon Wednesday, Bayer CEO Werner Baumann and his Monsanto counterpart Hugh Grant scored an audience with the incoming president to promote their pending merger, which will need to pass antitrust vetting from Trump's justice department.  But McKinney isn't purely an agri-tech nerd. In an address before an annual meeting of an Indiana pork industry group soon after taking the Indiana Department of Agriculture job, McKinney cited \"divine intervention\" as one of the main reasons for his move from the corner office to the state bureaucracy. After getting the call from Pence, he explained, \"my wife and I prayed about it, it just seemed right. I took the plunge, and here we are_and I'm having a ball!\"  Like former Georgia Gov.

Most of that comes from charter school support groups and labor unions; while Los Angeles limits individual contributions to $1,100, people can contribute an unlimited amount to independent expenditure committees. Former Mayor Richard Riordan, for example, gave $1 million to a political action committee aimed at unseating Zimmer. (As mayor in 1999, Riordan spent $1.4 million on candidates, with two of the four whom Riordan backed winning seats on the board.)  Los Angeles is considered a key battleground by charter supporters like philanthropist Eli Broad, who floated a confidential plan calling for doubling the number of charters in the district over the next eight years. And this isn't the first time that outside groups broke the bank on LAUSD school board elections: In 2013, total spending on three races surpassed $6 million, including a $1 million donation from then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That year, Zimmer and Garc_a won their races, while union-backed teacher M_nica Ratliff upset Antonio Sanchez with a sparsely financed campaign.  While the spending in LA is extremeespecially given the anemic 11.3 percent voter turnout Tuesdayit's not uncommon for outside groups to try to influence local school board elections. In a study published last August, researchers at Michigan State University and Columbia University examined more than 16,000 campaign contributions in school board races in five cities between 2008 and 2013. They found that spending from outside donors was widespread and noted that wealthy out-of-state donors, linked to education reform groups, tended to support reform-minded candidatesand often competed against union-backed candidates.  \"In the long run_I would expect this to continue to occur,\" says Sarah Reckhow, a Michigan State assistant professor who co-authored the report. \"[Donors] believe that this is good policy, and they care a lot about educationand they feel as very rich people, this is how they are going to use their power.\"", "date": "2017/03/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/millions-dollars-flood-los-angeles-school-board-races", "title": "The Fight Over Charter Schools Made Los Angeles' School Board Races Historically Expensive"}, {"text": "In last week's speech before a joint session of Congress, President Donald Trump once again brought up the issue of school choice, signaling to lawmakers an interest in pursuing federal legislation that would divert taxpayer dollars to private school tuition. But the real action is already taking place in statehouses across the country.  Since 2010, when a Republican wave washed over the House, Senate, and governor's mansions across the country, states have been steadily introducing voucher programs and voucher-like initiatives such as tax credits or education savings accounts. And 2017 is no different: 31 states have introduced bills to create or expand some private school choice program, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  So far, 22 states have bills dedicated toward tax credit scholarship programs, which, as my colleague Kristina Rizga pointed out last week, are increasingly popular among choice advocates like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos because they allow parents to receive tax credits for sending their kids to religious schools without governments technically transferring taxpayer money to religious organizations. Meanwhile, 20 states have legislation proposing education savings accounts, which allow families to use state money set aside in authorized accounts for education expenses, like private school tuition, homeschooling, or therapy.  Decades of research on voucher programs shows that they have little to no effect on academic achievement. In the past two years, research on newer programs in Louisiana and Ohio have mainly shown poorer academic outcomes. Last July, researchers at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, concluded in a study about Ohio's program that students who attended private schools on vouchers fared worse academically than those who attended public schools. \"Let us acknowledge that we did not expector, frankly, wishto see these negative effects for voucher participants,\" researchers wrote.  Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, cautioned that the Trump administration isn't necessarily driving more legislation at the state level. \"But if we see action out of the administration or out of Congress addressing school choice,\" Cunningham says, \"I'd imagine states would have to respond to that.\"  Here's a look at six places to watch where the debate over DeVos and Trump's vision for expanded school choice is playing out.  Arizona  Republican state Rep. Debbie Lesko introduced a bill in January that would broaden the state's existing education savings program, the first of its kind, to make funds available to all public school students in the next four years. The six-year-old program initially assisted students with disabilities, allowing parents to use funds from a state-run account for private school tuition, therapy, and other education expenses. Over the years, state lawmakers have broadened the scope of who's eligible to include children attending failing schools, in the foster care system, from military families, in schools on tribal lands, and who have siblings involved in the state's ESA program.  A state audit recently concluded that the state's education department needed to improve management and oversight of the program. Between August 2015 and January 2016, the state Auditor General found, more than $102,000 in education savings account funds were either misspent or not spent at all. A separate bill would require the Arizona Department of Education to contract an independent firm to oversee and make changes to the ESA program.  The latest proposed expansion would establish an extensive voucher program similar to that of Nevada, where lawmakers created a state-run education savings account for any student regardless of income. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in September that though the savings account approach was constitutional, its funding was not. The order prevented the program from going into place until lawmakers devise an alternative funding mechanism.  The Arizona bill is currently in the state's Senate. According to the Arizona Republic, taxpayers could be on the hook for at least an additional $24 million each year, depending on how many people participate in the program. Still, Lesko told the newspaper on February 8 that she was confident that Gov. Doug Ducey would sign the bill if it passed through the state legislature. Ducey praised efforts to promote school choice at a rally in January but did not take a stand on the voucher bill.  Missouri  Republican state Sen. Ed Emery introduced a far-reaching bill on January 25 that would open up an education savings program for all students in Missouri. The bill would create education savings accounts that are funded by tax credits from private donations. The money would then pass through education assistance programs and loaded onto eligible parents' debit cards. The original measure was meant to focus on students with disabilities and students under state protection, but Emery offered an expanded version in committee.  When former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, was in office, he criticized voucher programs and twice blocked efforts to change Missouri's school transfer law out of concern that public money could be used for tuition at religious private schools and virtual schools, violating the state constitution. But newly elected Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has expressed support for education savings accounts, at least for students with disabilities. He even touted Arizona's savings account law in his State of the State speech, calling it a \"success.\"  Kentucky  With Republicans in charge of the state House for the first time in 95 years, lawmakers could have their hands full with various school choice bills. A bill that would make Kentucky the 44th state to allow public charter schools to open passed the House on Friday, despite opposition from teachers' unions. The General Assembly could also consider establishing a tax-credit scholarship program for low-income students and students with disabilities.  Last year, state Rep. Addia Wuchner introduced a bill that would have established an education savings account program for parents of students with disabilities. She told the Courier-Journal in March 2016 that the savings account was not a voucher program and would allow \"parents to use those taxpayer dollars to meet the needs of a very specific group of students.\" It failed to make it past the committee level.  Even if voucher-style legislation doesn't pass this session, Gov. Matt Bevin is a staunch supporter of expanding school choice and vouchersboth of which, he says on his campaign site, are needed to \"end the monopoly that exists in Kentucky's school system.\"  New Hampshire  On February 23, the state Senate approved a bill that would create \"education freedom savings accounts\" for families to use 90 percent of state per-pupil dollars toward tuition for charter, private, homeschooling, and other education expenses. The bill doesn't explicitly cap income for eligibility, and the state's Department of Education would have to approve each school. A separate House bill would create a savings account for students with disabilities.  With the House, Senate, and the governorship all under Republican control, school choice expansion appears to be a possibility. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who supported DeVos during her confirmation, has espoused parental choice but hasn't spoken publicly about the savings account bill. \"Whether they opt for charter schools, traditional public schools, home schools, or private schools, government should not create barriers to their options,\" Sununu wrote in an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader last January.  Indiana  In January, lawmakers briefly feuded over a voucher provision that was slipped into a bill meant to expand the state's preschool program; a clause in the bill would make families in the program eligible to obtain a voucher through the state's Choice Scholarship program to attend private school in kindergarten and beyond. Legislators reportedly had discussed a similar provision when the preschool pilot program was first approved in 2014, but it failed to make it into the final law. A Senate version of the preschool expansion bill, which would allow students in all counties to participate in the state's program, does not include the voucher provision.  The bill passed the House on February 7 and is in the Senate Committee on Education and Career Development. (The state Senate approved its version of the bill on March 1.) Separately, a bill introduced in the Senate in January would establish a scholarship fund for students with disabilities.  Texas  In late January, state Sen. Larry Taylor introduced a bill that would create two programs: one that would allow any student to receive state money in an education savings account to subsidize the cost of private or homeschooling, and another that would create tax-credit-funded scholarships to pay private school tuition, reviving a proposal contested during the 2015 legislative session, when it passed in the state Senate but got stuck in the House.  The effort hit a wall on February 28, when the newly named House Public Education chair, Republican Dan Huberty, told the Texas Tribune that such a bill would be dead this legislative session. Two days after Huberty's remarks, school choice activists called on the state GOP to censure him, noting that his views differ from that of the party's leadership. Given that Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went so far as to add it to his legislative priorities for the 2017 cycle, it's unlikely he'll relent if the bill falters. At a Dallas Regional Chamber luncheon last October, Patrick pledged to \"fight for school choice session after session after session.\"", "date": "2017/03/08", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/school-voucher-bills-across-country", "title": "The Battle Over School Choice Is Happening in Statehouses Across America"}, {"text": "The bad news keeps piling up for Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and his radical budget-cutting experiment. The state Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Republican governor and state legislature hadyet againfailed to adequately fund public schools by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.  The court ordered lawmakers to devise a plan that would meet constitutional standards by the end of June and mandated a new formula to increase government spending on the state's public education system. The demand for extra education funding couldn't come at a worse time for Brownback, as the governor and Republican-held state legislature are caught in a stalemate on whether Kansas should repeal Brownback's landmark income-tax cuts in order to solve shortfalls that have plagued the state budget in recent years.  \"We conclude the state's public financing system, through its structure and implementation, is not reasonably calculated to have all Kansas public education students meet or exceed the minimum constitutional standards of adequacy,\" the court wrote in an unsigned, unanimous opinion. By underfunding education, the judges said, the state system failed in one-fourth of all its public schools to appropriately educate students in basic reading and math skills and shortchanged half of the state's black students and one-third of its Hispanic students.  John Robb, an attorney representing the school districts involved in the lawsuit, told the Wichita Eagle that the ruling represented \"justice for kids,\" noting that the state could be forced to spend anywhere from $431 million to $893 million per year in additional education funding, depending on how lawmakers decide to calculate per-pupil spending levels.  The state's current legal trouble dates back to 2010, when four school districts sued the state, alleging that Kansas provided \"inequitable\" and \"inadequate\" funding to its public education system. The lawsuit attacked state funding from two angles. It alleged that the overall pool of money that the state devotes to education was far too low, violating the state's constitutional guarantee of an adequate education. And as Kansas reduced overall school funding, the school districts behind the lawsuit noted that the state's cuts were inequitably distributed. That distribution, they alleged, hurt the state's poorest districts and discriminated \"based upon district wealth.\"  Those concerns have only intensified since the lawsuit was first filed, as Kansas has struggled to climb out of a fiscal disaster. After Brownback took over as governor in 2011, he passed historically large tax cuts, promising that lower income taxes would spur economic growtha preview of what Donald Trump and fellow Republicans now want to do at the federal level. But those cuts have since been disastrous, leaving the state with a vast budget gap as tax revenue continually comes in below expected levels.  In 2013, a three-judge panel ruled against the state, ordering Kansas to provide an additional $400 million in education spending. \"It seems completely illogical,\" the court noted, \"that the state can argue that a reduction in education funding was necessitated by the downturn in the economy and the state's diminishing resources and at the same time cut taxes further.\" Brownback slammed the ruling for increasing the tax burden on Kansas residents, adding that the legislature, not the court, should make school funding decisions.  In 2014, the state Supreme Court weighed in on the equitable funding side of the lawsuit, ruling that the state's decades-old funding formula did not dedicate enough funds to low-income districts and violated the state constitution. At that time, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the question of whether the state's total per-pupil spending was adequate and instead remanded that question back to the lower court. A year later, Brownback signed a law that replaced the state's formula with a two-year block grant system intended as a stopgap until a permanent formula could be devised. But last February, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the state's block grant effort was inequitable. The court ordered lawmakers to increase funding for poor school districts or risk a statewide school shutdown. Six days before a June deadline, Kansas lawmakers passed an education funding measure that gave $38 million to poor districts and staved off a shutdown. Now, another shutdown looms if legislators fail to come up with another plan to change the state's formula.  The decision marks a blow for Brownback and the Republican-led legislature tasked with drafting a funding plan by the court's new June deadline. In early February, Republican state senators proposed a 5 percent cut to public education spending for the rest of the fiscal yearcutting $120 million in spending through Juneand raising income taxes as part of a plan to close the state's budget gap. That decision quickly fell apart after it drew the ire of educators and activists. Lawmakers eventually passed an increase to the state income tax, but Brownback vetoed it.

Alexander Acosta, center, as US attorney in southern Florida in 2006  At a press conference Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump announced Florida International University College of Law Dean R. Alexander Acosta as his next nominee to oversee the US Department of Labor. The decision comes after a slew of scandals and mounting pressure from Republicans derailed Trump's previous pick, fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, who withdrew his name from contention on Wednesday, a day before his confirmation hearing was scheduled.  Trump lauded Acosta's credentials as a Harvard Law School graduate, a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, and a member of the National Labor Relations Board, emphasizing that Acosta had previously been confirmed by the Senate three times. \"I've wished him the best,\" Trump told reporters. \"I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.\" If confirmed, Acosta would be the only Latino in Trump's Cabinet.  But Trump didn't mention one of Acosta's less admirable roles. Acosta served as assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from 2003 to 2005 under President George W. Bushthe first Latino in that roleand was at the center of a scandal over hiring practices. During Acosta's tenure, Brad Schlozman, a deputy assistant attorney general, \"improperly considered political and ideological affiliations\" when he hired attorneys to work at the Civil Rights Division, according to a Justice Department inspector general report written in 2008. \"Attorneys hired by Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\" the report found. That consideration, the report concluded, violated the Civil Service Reform Act and department policy that bars discrimination in hiring based on political and ideological affiliations.  The agency concluded that Acosta and other Civil Rights Division managers failed to \"exercise sufficient oversight to ensure that Schlozman did not engage in inappropriate hiring and personnel practices.\" Specifically, Acosta and Deputy Attorney General Wan Kim \"failed to ensure that Schlozman's hiring and personnel decisions were based on proper considerations,\" the report noted.  When Acosta first took over as law school dean in 2009, H. T. Smith, director of FIU's trial advocacy program, told the Miami New Times that Acosta's stint at the Civil Rights Division \"caused a rift with the black community,\" adding that the former Miami prosecutor needed to meet with faculty members to heal that divide. The NAACP's Miami-Dade branch expressed concern, telling the Miami Herald at the time of Acosta's hire that his \"lack of diversity in hiring and promotion while serving as U.S. attorney gives cause for concern for his consideration as dean of FIU's College of Law.\"  Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, condemned the \"egregious conduct\" that played out during Acosta's time at the Justice Department. \"It is hard to believe that Mr. Acosta would now be nominated to lead a federal agency tasked with promoting lawful hiring practices and safe workplaces,\" Clarke said in a statement released after Trump's announcement.

Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) told colleagues Wednesday that they will not vote for GOP billionaire megadonor Betsy DeVos for education secretary, throwing her nomination in doubt just a day after a committee voted to advance DeVos' bid to the full Senate.  With the GOP-Democrat split in the Senate at 52-48, \"no\" votes from Collins and Murkowskiand a party-line vote from Democratswould tie the count at 50, leaving Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote.

Teachers unions, activists, and Senate Democrats criticized DeVos, a longtime school choice proponent and wife of Amway scion Dick DeVos, saying that she lacks proper qualifications, isn't committed to public education, and may not be willing to enforce federal laws that protect students with disabilities. In the weeks since DeVos' initial hearing, calls flooded the offices of senators who served on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, mostly in opposition to her nomination.  Senate Democrats debated whether the initial vote in favor of DeVos was valid after Sen. Orrin Hatch voted while absent. Committee chair Sen.

Unless presented with a warrant or court order, the sheriff's department would no longer comply with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to hold inmates suspected of being undocumented or notify the agency ahead of their release.  Hernandez's decision, which goes into effect February 1 and makes the county Texas' first designated sanctuary, has prompted considerable backlash from Texas Republicans. And now, perhaps inspired by President Donald Trump's threats to strip federal funding from \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has demanded that Hernandez reverse courseor risk millions of dollars in state funding.  Hernandezwho promised during her campaign to cut cooperation with ICEhas so far refused to stand down, saying she would not let \"fear and misinformation\" dictate her actions.  In an interview on Fox & Friends on Wednesday, Abbott called Hernandez's actions \"outrageous\" and vowed to ban sanctuary cities in Texas. He promised to cut off state grants to cities, pursue legislation that would remove officials that promote the practice, and impose criminal and financial penalties. The Texas Tribune reported on Friday that Abbott's office had requested a list of federal and state funding to Travis County from the state's budget office.  In a letter to Hernandez, the governor noted that the county sheriff department received $1.8 million in grant money from the state's Criminal Justice Division in 2015. Still, Hernandezwho promised during her campaign to cut cooperation with ICEhas so far refused to stand down, telling the Texas Tribune that she would not let \"fear and misinformation\" dictate her actions.  This isn't the first time the state government has had a rift with a county sheriff over immigration enforcement. In 2015, Abbott vowed to withhold state funds from Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez when she said she would assess ICE hold requests on a case-by-case basis. (She later said her remarks were taken out of context and promised to comply with federal immigration officials.) In November, state Sen. Charles Perry introduced a bill that required county jails to comply with federal immigration officials and effectively banned sanctuary cities in Texas. The bill is currently in the Senate Committee on State Affairs and slated for a public hearing on February 2; a similar attempt at enacting a ban faltered in 2015.) And in December, when students at several Texas universities called on administrators to establish safe havens for undocumented immigrants on campus, Abbott promised on Twitter that he would slash funding for state universities that became sanctuary campuses.  Just this week, Trump signed an executive order that would slash federal funding to cities and counties that opted not to cooperate with federal deportation efforts. In Austin's case, that would amount to $43 million in federal grants.

With an extra week to get ready, Senate Democrats came preparedand DeVos, oddly enough, did not.  While Republicans on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions lauded the billionaire philanthropistand prominent GOP donorfor her commitment to expanding charter schools and voucher programs, committee Democrats barraged DeVos with specific, pointed questions about her attempts to privatize public education, even pleading with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the HELP chairman, for the opportunity to ask more questions as the three-and-a-half-hour hearing boiled over.  DeVos reaffirmed her support for an education system beyond a \"one size fits all\" approach that opened up choices\"whether magnet, virtual, charter, home, religious, or any combination thereof.\" But when pushed beyond her talking points, she was stiff and often thrown off her game:  \"If you were not a multibillionaire_\"  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) didn't shy away from challenging DeVos on her family's large contributions to the Republican Party. \"Do you think that if you were not a multibillionaire, if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions, that you would be sitting here today?\" Sanders followed up by grilling DeVos on free college education and tax cuts on the richest Americans.  \"Do you not want to answer my question?\"  During a tense exchange, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) challenged DeVos on whether schools that receive federal funding should meet the same accountability standards, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, and report the same information on instances of bullying, discipline, and harassment. DeVos was_less than forthcoming.  Growth, proficiency_and conversion therapy  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) wanted to know if DeVos thought test scores should measure a student's proficiency (i.e., did she reach a specific standard?) or a student's growth (i.e., did she improve over time?). After DeVos struggled to clarify the distinction, Franken responded, \"This is a subject that has been debated in the education community for years_But it surprises me that you don't know this issue.\" He also pushed DeVos on her family's past donations to groups that support anti-LGBT causesincluding Focus on the Family, a nonprofit founded by evangelical leader James Dobsonand even asked whether DeVos supported conversion therapy.  Campus sexual assault  Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) asked whether DeVos would uphold a 2011 Department of Education letter establishing that sexual assault on college campuses was covered by Title IX and school reporting standards. DeVos would not commit to an answer, noting it would be \"premature\" to do so and that she would work with lawmakers to find a resolution.  Gunsand bears?!  Longtime gun control proponent Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked DeVos directly whether guns had any place in schools. \"That's best left to locales and states to decide,\" she responded. When Murphy followed up, DeVos referred back to an earlier question about an elementary school from Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.). \"I would imagine that there's probably a gun at the school to protect from potential grizzlies,\" DeVos said.  Kids with disabilities  Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), whose son has cerebral palsy, questioned DeVos on her knowledge of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Actparticularly whether DeVos knew that it was a federal law. DeVos eventually said she \"may have confused it\" with something else.  On the Prince Foundation board or not?  Hassan also asked DeVos about a $5.2 million donation that the Edger and Elsa Prince Foundation made to Focus on the Family. As my colleague Kristina Rizga noted in her new, in-depth investigation, DeVos was listed as a vice president of the Prince Foundation in tax documents through at least 2014.

American Federation of Teachers (AFT) president Randi Weingarten called DeVos \"the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education.\" National Education Association (NEA) president Lily Eskelsen Garc_a noted the administration's choice \"demonstrated just how out of touch it is with what works best for students, parents, educators, and communities.\"  Educators have worried that DeVos, a prominent Republican fundraiser, and her support for \"school choice\" and the use of vouchers would endanger public education. With the billionaire's confirmation hearing slated for Wednesday, the nation's two biggest teachers' unions have gone on the offensive with grassroots campaigns to challenge DeVos' nomination.  \"We did everything in our power to get Hillary Clinton elected. We didn't have a plan B.\"  Neither group anticipated Donald Trump to win the election. \"We did everything in our power to get Hillary Clinton elected. We didn't have a plan B,\" Weingarten says. \"We always thought Donald Trump would be as dangerous as he's showing he is.\" But both unions say they were unsurprised by Trump's selection of DeVos, whose past work in Michigan align with the president-elect's proposals to direct federal dollars toward private and charter schools. \"We have many, many years of experience with her and her undermining of the public education system in Michigan. We have frontline stories about what her agenda and the Trump agenda has meant to communities and to students,\" says Mary Kusler, senior director of the NEA Center for Advocacy. \"She was not somebody who was plucked out of thin air for us.\"  Education historian Diane Ravitch, who founded the advocacy group Network for Public Education in 2013, described unions as \"shocked and worried\" by the DeVos selection in an email to Mother Jones. \"The previous Republican administrations did not threaten the very existence of public education and teachers unions,\" she added. \"This coming four years is an existential threat to a basic Democratic institution: public schools. Trump has picked a Secretary who is hostile to public schools. This is unprecedented.\"  In the weeks following the election, the unions at the national and local levels turned their attention to trying to disqualify DeVos by emphasizing her lack of experience in public education and her work in Michigan. Last month, the AFT, which has 1.6 million members, went on an education campaign, unveiling fact sheets on DeVos and other Cabinet picks like Labor Secretary-designee and fast-food executive Andrew Puzder and Health and Human Services Secretary-designee Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). At these agencies, Weingarten says, are \"people who have been appointed whose ideology seems antithetical to the mission of these agencies.\"  On December 6, the AFT and NEA released a joint open letter condemning Trump's pick, stating that her \"sole 'qualification' for the job is the two decades she has spent attempting to dismantle the American public school system.\" The letter has amassed more than 130,000 signatures from parents, teachers, and other supporters. Representatives from both unions say that members have been arranging meetings with senators. Meanwhile, local affiliates for both unions have encouraged members to flood senators with calls, emails, and letters in opposition.  \"This coming four years is an existential threat to a basic Democratic institution: public schools. Trump has picked a Secretary who is hostile to public schools. This is unprecedented.\"  Though activity settled down leading up to the holidays, the NEAthe nation's largest union with 3 million membersexpects to ramp up calls from members to speak on behalf of students in the next week to senators on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which will oversee DeVos' hearing. When asked if current efforts to organize around the confirmation hearing was enough to oppose DeVos, Kusler said the union's members were doing what they could. \"At the end of the day, you've got to remember: Our members are teaching kids during the day,\" she added, likening the current grassroots efforts to that of 2015, when both unions engaged in separate campaigns during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, now known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. \"We've never been in this situation around the confirmation for a secretary of education that has looked like this,\" Kusler says. \"So engaging our members using the tactics we use anyway for a legislative fight around a confirmation of a secretary is unprecedented.\"  Katharine Strunk, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California who studies teachers' unions, noted that unions would be able to activate their base of support, but that they may have less sway in lobbying efforts, given Republicans' firm control of the Senate. \"If you don't have the majority,\" the AFT's Weingarten says, \"it's a pretty uphill battle.\" Voters who sided with Trump may have wanted to shake up the system, Weingarten adds, but she doesn't believe that they \"voted to end public education as we know it.\"  \"They see teachers' unions not as partners in providing a good education for kids, but as adversaries.\"  Carol Burris, executive director of Ravitch's Network for Public Education, says she anticipates a difficult four years for teachers' unions. The organization engaged in its own campaign, urging its supporters to send letters to senators over the holidays and to call and visit their offices. This week, the network called on members to make phone calls to senators in each state, particularly those on the committee overseeing DeVos' hearing. \"Betsy DeVos and the people who believe what she believes have no patience for unions in any form and certainly not teachers' unions,\" she says. \"They see teachers' unions not as partners in providing a good education for kids, but as adversaries.\"  Future challenges from the unions will largely depend on the policies the Trump administration chooses to pursue. In a speech at the National Press Club on Monday, Weingarten warned that DeVos' nomination threatened the bipartisan agreement around the federal government's role in shaping education and could undermine the public education system DeVos would be charged with overseeing.  \"Betsy DeVos lacks the qualifications and experience to serve as secretary of education,\" Weingarten told the audience. \"Her drive to privatize education is demonstrably destructive to public schools and to the educational success of all of our children.\"", "date": "2017/01/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/teachers-unions-challenge-betsy-devos-pick-education-secretary", "title": "Donald Trump Is \"an Existential Threat to Public Schools\""}, {"text": "During his address before a joint session of Congress earlier this week, President Donald Trump paused to introduce Denisha Merriweather, a graduate student from Florida sitting with first lady Melania Trump. Merriweather \"failed third grade twice\" in Florida's public schools, Trump said. \"But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, great learning center, with the help of a tax credit,\" he continued, referring to Florida's tax credit scholarship program that allows students attend private schools. Because of this opportunity, Denisha became the first member of her family to graduate from high school and college.  Trump used Denisha's story to call for his favorite education policy, school choice, asking lawmakers to \"pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\"  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has also been pointing to Denisha and Florida in the past two weeks as a way to promote school choice. \"Florida is a good and growing example of what can happen when you have a robust array of choices,\" DeVos told a conservative radio host on February 15. DeVos brought up the state's school choice model again during her speech to the leaders of historically black colleges earlier this week.  So what is it about Florida? For starters, the state offers many different types of school choice, including charter schools, vouchers for low-income students and those with disabilities, and tax credit scholarships. Charter schools, found in 43 states and Washington, DC, represent the most common type of school choice. Vouchers are a little more complicated: They essentially operate like a state-issued coupon that parents can use to send their child to private or religious schools. The amount is typically what the state would use to send a kid to a public school. But vouchers are difficult to implement, because many state constitutions, like those in Michigan and Florida, have what are called Blaine Amendments, which prohibit spending public dollars on religious schools. And notably, only 31 percent of Americans support vouchers.  \"Democrats don't like vouchers. Republicans don't like federal programs, and would rather leave major school reform decisions up to states and local communities.\"  Tax credit scholarships provide a crafty mechanism to get around these obstacles. Tax credits are given to individuals and corporations that donate money to scholarship-granting institutions; if parents end up using those scholarships to send their kids to religious schoolsand 79 percent of students in private schools are taught by institutions affiliated with churchesthe government technically is not transferring taxpayer money directly to religious organizations.  While DeVos is best known as an advocate of vouchers, most veteran Beltway insiders told me that a federal voucher program is very unlikely. \"Democrats don't like vouchers. Republicans don't like federal programs, and would rather leave major school reform decisions up to states and local communities,\" Rick Hess, a veteran education policy expert with the conservative American Enterprise Institute said. \"Realistically, nobody thinks they've got the votes to do a federal school choice law, especially in the Senate.\"  This political reality is perhaps why Trump and DeVos are singling out Florida's tax credit programs as a way to expand private schooling options. While Trump and DeVos have not specified what shape this policy might take at the federal level, most of these changes will come from the state legislators. Republicans have full control of the executive and legislative branches in 25 states, and control the governor's house or the state legislature in 44 states. At least 14 states have already proposed bills in this legislative session that would expand some form of vouchers or tax credit scholarships, according to a Center for American Progress analysis. (And 17 states already provide some form of tax credit scholarships, according to EdChoice.)  This perfect storm for pushing through various voucher schemes comes at a time when the results on the outcomes of these programs \"are the worst in the history of the field,\" according to New America researcher Kevin Carey, who analyzed the results in a recent New York Times article. Until about two years ago, most studies on vouchers produced mixed results, with some showing slight increases in test scores or graduation rates for students using them. But the most recent research has not been good, according to Carey: A 2016 study, funded by the pro-voucher Walton Family Foundation and conducted by the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, found that students who used vouchers in a large Ohio program \"have fared worse academically compared to their closely matched peers attending public schools.\"  A 2011 investigation of Florida private schools described the system as a \"cottage industry of fraud and chaos.\"  Then there is the issue of state oversight and transparency. Many states, including Florida, have little to no jurisdiction over private schools and don't make student achievement data public, save for attendance. A 2011 award-winning investigation by Gus Garcia-Roberts of the Miami New Times described the resulting system as a \"cottage industry of fraud and chaos.\" Schools could qualify to educate voucher and tax credit scholarship students even though they had no accreditation or curriculum. Some staffers in these schools were convicted criminals for drug dealing, kidnapping, and burglary. \"In one school's 'business management' class, students shook cans for coins on the streets,\" Garcia-Roberts found.  Florida's Department of Education investigated 38 schools suspected of fraud and in 25 cases, the allegations were substantiated. \"It's like a perverse science experiment, using disabled school kids as lab rats and funded by nine figures in taxpayer cash,\" Garcia-Roberts wrote. \"Dole out millions to anybody calling himself as educator. Don't regulate curriculum or even visit campuses to see where the money is going.\"  But these on-the-ground realities in Florida won't tame the enthusiasm of a voucher booster like DeVos. As I showed in my recent investigation, her philanthropic giving shows an overwhelming preference for promoting private, Christian schools, and conservative, free-market think tanks that work to shrink the public sector in every sphere, including education. These past choices suggest that the dataor the fact that there are many stories like Denisha Merriweather's in America's public schoolsdoesn't matter.", "date": "2017/03/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/betsy-devos-donald-trump-florida-school-choice-vouchers", "title": "The Next Step in the Trump-DeVos Plan to Send Taxpayer Money to Religious Schools"}, {"text": "Demonstrators at a January 29 protest in Washington, DC  Despite an avalanche of emails and calls flooding Capitol Hill in the past two weeks, the Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos on Tuesday as the next secretary of education. With Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voting against DeVos, Vice President Mike Pence had to be dispatched to cast the tie-breaking vote. No education secretary nominee has ever faced a vote this close, and no other nominee needed a vice president to break the tie.  Over the past two months, I've been digging into DeVos' record on educationparticularly her connection to vouchers and her contributions to private, religious schools. Here are three things to keep in mind about Trump's new education boss:  DeVos enters the office as one of the most unpopular nominees for the nation's top job in education.  Among all Trump's nominees, DeVos faced the most vocal opposition from parents, educators, and activists. They seemed to particularly rally around the nominee's lackluster performance during confirmation hearings, including her minimal knowledge about the federal laws enforced by the department, such as those protecting students with disabilities. Opponents were also troubled by DeVos' history of pushing public school dollars to private and religious schools.  Teachers unions, civil rights activists, and other opponents sent more than a million emails and made tens of thousands of phone calls to congressional offices in the last two weeks to oppose DeVos' confirmation. Heidi Hess, who runs political campaigns for CREDO, a mobile company that supports activism projects, told NPR that DeVos enraged their members more than any other nominee, which resulted in a record 1.5 million petition signatures and 30,000 phone calls. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted on February 2 that the previous three days had \"been the busiest in Capitol switchboard history\" by \"almost double.\"  DeVos' philanthropic record speaks volumes about how she might implement Trump's vision of \"school choice.\"  DeVos is a daughter of privilege who was raised in the tradition of the Christian Reformed Church, a conservative Dutch Calvinist denomination, and she's married to Richard (Dick) DeVos Jr., whose billionaire father, Richard Sr., co-founded the multilevel-marketing empire Amway. While the DeVoses aren't as well known as, say, the Koch brothers, they played a key role in building the modern conservative movement and pushing the Republican Party further to the right.  And then there's DeVos' long support of vouchers for private, religious schools; conservative Christian groups like the Foundation for Traditional Values, which has pushed to breach the wall between church and state; and organizations like Michigan's Macinac Center for Public Policy, which has championed the privatization of education system.  As I wrote in our recent investigation, DeVos-funded organizations include:  Acton Institute for the Study of Religion & Liberty: Betsy DeVos once served on the board of this Grand Rapids-based think tank, which endorses a blend of religious conservatism and unrestrained capitalism. It is headed by a Catholic priest, Robert Sirico, who has argued that welfare programs should be replaced by religious charities. In a paper titled \"America's Public Schools: Crisis and Cure,\" a former Acton advisory board member named Ronald Nash wrote, \"No real progress towards improving American education can occur as long as 90 percent of American children are being taught in government schools that ignore moral and religious beliefs.\" In November, Acton came under fire for an essay on its website whose original title was \"Bring Back Child Labor.\" (The title was quickly changed.) The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation contributed $1.28 million from 2000 to 2014, and the Prince Foundation (run by Betsy DeVos' parents) donated at least $550,000.

The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation contributed $1.28 million from 2000 to 2014, and the Prince Foundation (run by Betsy DeVos' parents) donated at least $550,000. The Foundation for Traditional Values: Led by James Muffett, the organization is the education arm of Citizens for Traditional Values, a political action group whose mission is to preserve \"the influence of faith and family as the great foundation of American freedom embodied in our Judeo-Christian heritage.\" On the website dedicated to Muffett's seminars, a page devoted to a lecture titled \"The Greatest Story Never Told\" states, \"There was a time when schoolchildren were taught the truth about the Christian influence in our foundationsbut no longer.\" The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation contributed $232,390 from 1999 to 2010.  Additionally, Betsy DeVos has spent at least two decades pushing taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools to the center of the Republican Party's education agenda, thanks in large part to Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy. As our investigation found:  In the mid-'90s, Mackinac leadership suggested a long-term strategy on how to make unpopular voucher policies more palatable for mainstream America. Its then-senior vice president, Joseph Overton, developed what became known as the Overton Window, a theory of how a policy that's initially considered extreme might over time be normalized through gradual shifts in public opinion. Education policies were placed on a liberal-conservative continuum, with the far left representing \"Compulsory indoctrination in government schools\" and the far right representing \"No government schools.\" Charter schools, then, became a Trojan horse for voucher advocates: Once public school supporters got used to the idea of charters, activists would attempt to nudge public opinion closer to supporting tax credits to pay for private schools. In Michigan, Detroit has been at the heart of the charter push, which began when Gov. John Engler signed charter schools into law in 1993. Three years later, then-Detroit Metro Times reporter Curt Guyette showed how the Prince Foundation, as well as the foundation run by Dick DeVos' parents, funded a carefully orchestrated campaign to label Detroit's public schools as failingand pushed for charters and \"universal educational choice\" as a better alternative. Betsy DeVos has since written about the need to \"retire\" and \"replace\" Detroit's public school system and pressed for expanding charter schools and vouchers.  Critics argue that this is an attempt to expand the definition of \"school choice\"typically understood as giving parents the ability to pick any traditional public school or charter school in a districtto allow taxpayer money to follow students to any private school via vouchers. Some critics of school choice argue that charters, which are publicly funded but governed by appointed boards and often run by private companies with varying degrees of state oversight, can skim high-performing students from traditional public schools, leaving them with more high-needs kids and less money. But the push for so-called \"universal school choice\" could take that a step further by eventually leading to a radical redirection of funds from traditional public schools to private schools, many of which are Christian.  What can DeVos accomplish in the next four years?  Trump's signature education proposal calls for dedicating $20 billion in federal money to help families move away from what he has called our \"failing government schools\" and instead choose charter, private, or religious schools. To do that, Trump could create an incentive program to encourage states to allow vouchers, lift caps on charter schools, and decrease state oversight over what kind of charter schools can be open and how they operate. In DeVos, he found a partner who has spent the past two decades doing just that in Michigan, as we recently documented.", "date": "2017/02/07", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/breaking-senate-confirmed-betsy-devos-our-nations-education-chief", "title": "The Senate Just Confirmed Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary.

As most of the world knows by now, Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not tell the truth when he was asked during his confirmation hearings about contacts with Russian officials.  But Sessions isn't the only one. At least four other cabinet members made statements during their nomination hearings that are contradicted by actual facts: EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.  The statements were all made under oath, except those of DeVos. It is a crime to \"knowingly\" lie in testimony to Congress, but it's rarely prosecuted.  If you know of instances that we've missed, email us.  EPA Chief Scott Pruitt  The falsehood: Pruitt stated in testimony that he had never used a private email account to conduct business while he was Oklahoma's attorney general.  The truth: Fox News 25 asked the state Attorney General's office whether Pruitt had used a personal email. The answer was yes.  The Associated Press also received emails in response to a public records request showing Pruitt using a private account to conduct state business.  Pruitt's response: None.  Education Secretary Betsy Devos  The falsehood: DeVos said during her confirmation hearings that she has not been involved in her family's foundation, which has given millions of dollars to group that oppose LGBT rights.  \"You sit on the board,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., noted. DeVos responded, \"I do not.\"  The truth: As The Intercept has detailed, tax filings have listed DeVos as vice president of the foundation's board for 17 years.  DeVos' response: She said the foundation's nearly two decades of filings were the result of a \"clerical error.\"  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  The falsehood: In written testimony, Mnuchin denied that his former bank had used so-called \"robo-signing\" to improperly foreclose on homeowners. \"OneWest Bank did not robo-sign' documents,\" Mnuchin wrote.  The truth: As the Columbus Dispatch detailed, OneWest Bank employees frequently signed documents in bulk without proper review, which is what robo-signing is. One employee testified that she typically signed about 750 foreclosure documents per week. The Dispatch noted that a judge stopped three OneWest Bank foreclosures \"specifically based on inaccurate robo-signings.\" Reuters also detailed the bank's robo-signing back in 2011.  Mnuchin's response: A spokesman offered the following statement after the Dispatch's story: \"The media is picking on a hard-working bank employee whose reputation has been maligned but whose work has been upheld by numerous courts all around the country in the face of scurrilous and false allegations.\"  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price  The falsehood: During his confirmation hearings, Price insisted that the discount he got on a biotech stock was \"available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.\"  The truth: As the Wall Street Journal reported, fewer than 20 investors in the U.S. were offered the discount, including Price.  Price's response: Price did not respond to the Journal's story.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions  The falsehood: Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., asked Sessions whether \"anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.\"  Session responded: \"Sen. Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"  The truth: Yes, he did.  Sessions' response: His office's first statement: \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\"  An anonymous White House official gave a New York Times reporter a different take, saying Sessions and the ambassador did talk and \"had superficial comments about election-related news.\"  Sessions' spokeswoman later said Sessions often spoke with \"foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.\" Washington Post reporters asked all 26 members of the committee if they spoke to the Russian ambassador in 2016.

Rather than answering the question, Gorka lambasted the Morning Edition host. \"It would be nice if you actually reported things accurately,\" Gorka responded. \"This is not a theological seminary. This is the White House. And we're not going to get into theological debates. If the president has a certain attitude to a certain religion, that's something you can ask him.\"  Gorka went on to say that the United States is not at war with Islam: \"That would be absurd.\" Yet Gorka's refusal to answer Inskeep's simple question was telling, as was his insistence on reframing any discussion of Islam in political and ideological terms. \"We're talking about national security and the totalitarian ideologies that drive the groups that threaten America,\" he said.  Gorka's evasive comments nodded to a fringe concept that's been floating for more than a decade: the idea that Islam is not a legitimate religion, but a dangerous political ideology. This idea has gained new currency as Trump has elevated some of its adherents to the highest levels of his administration. At a conference last summer, Lt. General Michael Flynn, who would become Trump's initial pick for national security adviser, told an audience, \"I don't see Islam as a religion. I see it as a political ideology that_will mask itself as a religion globally, and especially in the West, especially in the United States, because it can hide behind and protect itself by what we call freedom of religion.\" (Flynn resigned last month after lying about his contacts with Russia.)  Last July, Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart who is now the president's chief strategist, told Mother Jones that Islam is \"a political ideology.\" Previously, Bannon had mocked former President George W. Bush for calling Islam \"a religion of peace,\" and suggested that there is an \"existential war\" unfolding between Islam and the West.  \"They lost some credibility and respect in Republican circlesuntil Donald Trump came around. He gave them the biggest platform they ever could have imagined.\"  Bannon's us-versus-them rhetoric echoes the argument articulated by Samuel Huntington in his controversial 1996 book, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order. In it, Huntington described a world split along \"fault lines\" between \"hostile\" rival civilizations, of which the \"Islamic civilization\" is the most troublesome. That narrative took hold among conservative evangelicals and the far-right fringe following the September 11 terror attacks. The recent strain of Islamophobia taps into long-standing Western stereotypes about and prejudices against Islam, says Khaled Beydoun, an associate professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law who studies the intersection of race, religion, and citizenship. These orientalist views portray the Muslim world as a separate civilization, inferior to the West, and inhabited by a monolithic religious and political group. \"These tropes, these stereotypes, continue to feed how Muslim identity is shaped and framed by Islamophobes today,\" Beydoun says. \"You see this framing adopted by Trump, and more importantly, the brain trust he has around him.\"  Painting the Muslims in such broad strokes feeds into the idea that Islam is not a true religion but rather something akin to a totalitarian cult. In 2002, the Reverand Jerry Falwell declared the prophet Mohammad a \"demon-possessed pedophile.\" In 2007, Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat Robertson said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to recognize that Islam is not a religion. It is a worldwide political movement meant on domination of the world. And it is meant to subjugate all people under Islamic law.\" In 2010, former Lt. General Jerry Boykin, then the executive vice president of the Family Research Council, stated that Islam \"should not be protected under the First Amendment, particularly given that those following the dictates of the Quran are under an obligation to destroy our Constitution and replace it with Sharia law.\"  #Trump Choice for National Security Adviser Michael Flynn: Islam is a political ideology that hides itself behind what they call a religion. pic.twitter.com/5hqaSem7Dq  Zaid Benjamin (@zaidbenjamin) November 18, 2016  \"I think you see an alignment of these very right-wing Christian elements like Boykin viewing Islam as an illegitimate religionthey view the religion as not being a bona fide faith that should be protected by the First Amendmentaligning with nonreligious figures like Michael Flynn, who wrote this book Field of Fight,\" says Beydoun. In his 2016 book, Flynn wrote, \"We're in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam.\"  Another step toward the idea that Islam is not a religion is the notion that there is no such thing as peaceful Islam. David Yerushalmi, general council of the Center for Security Policy, once wrote, \"Islam was born in violence; it will die that way.\" He also scoffed at Bush for his \"ideological whim to build democracies among a ruthless people who believe in a murderous creed falsely labeled a 'religion of peace.'\" In 2010, Bannon, echoed these remarks, saying, \"Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of submission.\" Robert Spencer, the director of the Islamophobic site Jihad Watch, wrote a book on the topic: Religion of Peace? Why Christianity Is and Islam Isn't.  \"There is this framing of Islam as less a legitimate religion, the position that Islam isn't a religion in the way we understand Judaism or Christianity or Hinduism, that it's more political in nature, and that Muslims must be viewed as political actors who are following the dictates of this political ideology,\" Beydoun says. \"And if you buy that premise, the next step is, 'These individuals don't deserve the same kind of protections that Jews, Hindus, Christians, and so on do.'\"  Trump stated that the United States will have \"absolutely no choice\" but to shut down mosques because \"some bad things are happening.\"  In 2011, shortly after the controversy over the so-called Ground Zero mosque and the spread of a conspiracy theory that Shariah was taking over America, the Center for American Progress published a lengthy report titled \"Fear Inc.,\" which documented what amounted to a cottage industry of Islamophobic misinformation. Prominent players include Act for America, a \"national security\" group that currently boasts Flynn as a board member. Another is Frank Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, which has pushed the unlikely notion that Islamists are secretly trying to infiltrate the American government and prominent organizationsincluding the National Rifle Associationthrough a process he calls \"civilization jihad.\"  \"These were people who were always on Fox News, being cited on Pamela Geller's blog, who were always on Sean Hannity, the Christian Broadcast Network, the National Review, and others,\" says Faiz Shakir, the national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and one of the authors of the report. (Pamela Geller writes a prominent anti-Muslim blog.) \"You had major political groups who were then taking this and getting it into the mouths of lawmakers. At that time it was Allen West, Herman Cain, and Michele Bachmann. We went through a period where we had really fought back and marginalized some of these voices,\" says Shakir. \"They lost some credibility and respect in Republican circlesuntil Donald Trump came around. He gave them the biggest platform they ever could have imagined.\"  This network also had links with what would become Trump's inner circle. Gaffney appeared on Bannon's radio show 34 times. Gorka, a former Breitbart editor, has regularly appeared at Center for Security Policy events and on Gaffney's own radio program.

Trump himself has expressed some of the key tenets of the Islamophobic right. In late 2015, Trump proposed a total ban on Muslims entering the country, justifying the idea by citing a debunked survey commissioned by Gaffney's Center for Security Policy and conducted by Kellyanne Conway, who would become Trump's campaign manager. The survey claimed that 51 percent of those polled believe that Muslims in America should have the choice to be governed by Shariah, and a quarter agreed that violence against Americans in the United States \"can be justified as part of the global jihad.\" A few weeks earlier, he stated that the United States will have \"absolutely no choice\" but to shut down mosques because \"some bad things are happening.\"  There have already been previous efforts to prevent mosques from being built using the \"Islam is not a religion\" argument. \"Those are all real efforts,\" says Shakir. \"They have been on the back burner and bubbling up for a long time, and now they have people in positions of power who can effectuate these radical ideologies that they've long held on to.\" Until Trump provides some clarity on his true views, people on both sides of the issue may assume that he is unwilling to publicly state that Islam deserves the same legal status and protections as other religions.", "date": "2017/03/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/trump-gorka-islam-not-religion-islamophobia", "title": "How a Crazy Idea About Islam Went From the Fringe to the White House"}, {"text": "Darrell Issa on his way to a meeting in October 2015  Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), an early and outspoken supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, is known for launching frequent investigations of Democrats. Then, in a February 24 appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he suddenly became the first congressional Republican to call for a special prosecutor to investigate Trump's election. He's long used conspiracy theories to battle established climate science, yet on Thursday he joined the Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group of legislators dedicated to fighting climate change.  Why the about-face? The former chair of the House Oversight Committeefamous for his high-theater, low-yield investigations into alleged Democratic scandals involving Benghazi, the IRS, the gun sting gone awry known as Operation Fast and Furious, and Healthcare.gov, among othersis suddenly facing a very tough election. California's 49th Congressional District, where Issa has reigned for more than 16 years, has a growing Latino population that has helped push it slowly but steadily leftward. In November, Issa eked out a win over Democrat Doug Applegate, a political newcomer, by just 1,680 votes. Orange County, part of which falls within Issa's district, favored Hillary Clinton by a nine-point margin, marking the first time it voted for a Democrat for president since 1936. The New York Times recently called Issa \"probably the nation's most vulnerable incumbent.\"  Every week since the election, hundreds of people have descended on his San Diego County office to protest. Critics organized a town hall five miles from his office and raised $6,000 through a GoFundMe campaign for a full-page newspaper ad urging him to appear. Citing a \"long-standing obligation\" to tour a homeless shelter, he didn't show. Instead, he was represented by a giant \"Where's Waldo?\" cutout with his picture taped to its face.  \"It's been clear to those of us who live here that he's been in campaign mode 24/7,\" says Francine Busby, chair of the San Diego County Democratic Party. \"He's definitely feeling the heat down here. I have no doubt that the Republican warrior who has always toed the party line to the nth degree, who is now changing his tune, has very personal motivations because of the vulnerability he feels in his seat.\"  Upon learning that Issa had joined the Climate Solutions Caucus, one San Diego Republican political operative who asked to remain anonymous told Mother Jones, \"Wow. That is definitely a calculated move.\" Issa voted against the 2009 climate and clean-energy jobs bill and continues to make false claims that \"there is a wide range of scientific opinion\" on climate change and that \"the science community does not agree to the extent of the problem.\" The League of Conservation Voters gives him a lifetime score of just 4 percent for overwhelmingly voting \"anti-environment\" during his years in Congress. In 2013, the organization gave him a \"Climate Change Denier\" award for \"his extreme anti-science views, which put him at odds with 97 percent of scientists and a majority of the American people.\"  As Issa's constituents continue their leftward march, the congressman is starting to follow them.  Issa represents a \"highly environmentally conscious district,\" the operative says, where Republicans \"can't really win being anti-environment. Even the more conservative Republicans still are pretty centrist on climate issues and the environment. It doesn't surprise me that he would see that as beneficial, and I have a feeling that polling issues are guiding that too.\"  Some observers think Issa's call for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's role in the election might not have been a calculated attempt to distance himself from Trump and pacify his constituents. He may simply have said more than he intended in his appearance on Maher's show. \"I don't think he was prepared to have that question addressed to him,\" says Busby. \"There were two busloads of people who had been protesting him every step of the way in that studio that night, and I think that may have influenced his remarks.\"  \"My read on it,\" says the Republican political operative, \"was that this was probably a moment of intellectual honesty, particularly given his role on oversight, as something he would have suggested the Obama administration wouldn't be trusted to investigate themselves.\" But he added, \"These kinds of things are probably top-of-mind as opportunities to pander, and this will show that 'I am independent and not a Trumpster.'\"  If Issa blurted out more than he meant to, he was bailed out a few days later by news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had failed to disclose meetings with a Russian diplomat during the 2016 election. \"News overnight affirms what I've been saying: we need an independent review and Jeff Sessions should recuse himself,\" Issa tweeted on Thursday.  Kurt Bardella, a former Issa staffer who criticized Issa's embrace of Trump during the campaign, doesn't see Issa's call for a special prosecutor as a political maneuver. \"There were countless times that Darrell led the charge for impartial and independent investigations during the Obama Administration because he recognized the inherent conflict in the idea of self-policing,\" Bardella says. \"Anyone trying to speculate that what he said was because of pressure from his district is clearly unfamiliar with his extensive oversight body of work.\" And climate change, Bardella adds, \"has never been an issue that carries any weight in terms of the district.\"  Whatever his reasons, it seems clear that as Issa's constituents continue their leftward march, the congressman is starting to follow them.", "date": "2017/03/03", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/darrell-issa-donald-trump-investigation-climate-california", "title": "Under Pressure, Darrell Issa Takes a Sharp Left Turn"}, {"text": "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Los Angeles in early Feburary.  Donald Trump is quickly amassing the means to make good on his promise to deport millions of people from the United States. One of those tools is a federal program that enlists state and local cops and jail officials to identify people they believe may be undocumented immigrants. The Obama administration scaled down the program, in part due to criticism that it encouraged racial and ethnic profiling, created financial incentives to detain immigrants, and undermined relations between the police and immigrant communities. Now Trump is preparing to bring it back.  The program is known as 287(g) for the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1996 that created it. It established \"task force\" agreements that allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to deputize local and state law enforcement officers as immigration agents. The program gives these law enforcement officers the authority to stop, interrogate, and arrest anyone they believe to be unauthorized immigrants. It also gives deputized jail administrators access to immigration databases so they may refer undocumented immigrants to ICE for possible deportation. The 287(g) program enabled more than 175,000 deportations between 2006 and 2013, according to an analysis by the Marshall Project.  Last Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued memos to senior officials in his department outlining instructions for enforcing the president's January 25 executive order, which called for an aggressive effort to deport undocumented immigrants regardless of whether they had committed serious crimes. Referring to 287(g), Kelly called the program a highly effective \"force multiplier\" that has led to the identification of more than 400,000 \"removable aliens\" between 2006 and 2015, and he directed ICE to \"engage immediately with all willing and qualified law enforcement jurisdictions\" that may cooperate with the federal government under 287(g).  \"This is the deportation machine. If Trump is going to meet the kinds of numbers he announced during his campaign, this is how it will happen.\"  \"This is the deportation machine,\" says Daniel Stageman, a researcher at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice who studies immigration and criminal justice. \"If Trump is going to meet the kinds of numbers he announced during his campaign, this is how it will happen.\" Chris Rickerd, a policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, puts it in stark terms: \"There's potential for this to be an enormous driver of people coming into the system through the task forces and people being processed in the jails. 175,000 is a staggering number of people to have gone through this, but that may be only a small fraction of what's intended now.\"  Trump's executive order upends the Obama administration's policy of prioritizing immigrants convicted of serious crimes for deportation, which it adopted in late 2014. Now, \"the criteria basically allow you to arrest and deport anybody you want,\" says Darrel Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a professional organization of police chiefs and sheriffs. \"There's a lot of concern that people will get caught up in this who aren't the worst offenders.\" As Rickerd notes, \"The lack of prioritization means that just about every one of the 11 million people here without authorization has become a target.\"  The 287(g) program emerged in a series of fits and starts. The first agreements between DHS and local law enforcement began in the wake of September 11. After a lull, another surge of agreements began in 2006 after the Bush administration pushed the program in response to increased immigration from Mexico and Latin America. In 2012, the Obama administration rescinded all of the program's \"task force\" agreements after a series of racial and ethnic profiling controversies. Jail agreements were still issued, but slowed, under Obama. Currently, there are 37 agreements in place, down from more than 70.  The implications of resuscitating a program that Rickerd describes as \"almost dormant\" raises questions about the financial motivations of the jurisdictions that participate. Many jurisdictions that have made 287(g) jail agreements have also had detention contracts with ICE, receiving per diem fees for every immigration detainee they held. \"It's is a direct pipeline for their for-profit detention infrastructure,\" says Rickerd. In areas with both task force and jail agreements, the concerns compound. \"The task forces could arrest people on trumped-up charges, to book them for 287(g) processing for the jail.\"  \"The criteria basically allow you to arrest and deport anybody you want. There's a lot of concern that people will get caught up in this who aren't the worst offenders.\"  Law enforcement and mayors' associations have long been critical of programs like 287(g), claiming that they create a rift between communities and the police, making it more difficult to focus on serious offenses. \"Whenever local police get involved in immigration enforcement, that causes a great deal of reluctance on the part of undocumented immigrants and other immigrants to report crimes and victimization to the police,\" says Stephens. Victims of spousal abuse, for example, may fear calling the police if they think it means they could get deported. \"Community trust is a really big deal to local police. They cannot function effectively if they don't have as good a relationship as they can get.\"  Some of Trump's deportation plans, such as hiring thousands of ICE and border patrol agents, will require Congressional budget approval. But expanding the 287(g) program doesn't require Congress' sign-off, and is a minimal cost to the feds. The expense will fall on local jurisdictions, and if the past is any indicator, plenty will foot the bill. Stageman notes, \"There's a clear fiscal incentive for a lot of these jurisdictions to take part, on top of an already existing political and ideology incentive.\"  Currently, there are several pending 287(g) applications from jurisdictions that the ACLU has called out for alleged civil rights violations, unconstitutional practices, and misconduct. \"Those jurisdictions that have pending applications are likely the ones to be approved immediately,\" says Rickerd.  Because the recent executive orders and DHS memos call for a massive expansion of immigration detention, Stageman predicts that state and local jails that have seen a reduction in their populations will start \"scrambling to sign detention agreements\" with ICE. \"Because the system is going to expand so quickly, the structures necessary to ensure some standard of human rights in detention are essentially going to collapse,\" Stageman says. \"You will see a tremendous amount of abuse.\"", "date": "2017/02/28", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/donald-trump-deportation-police-program", "title": "Trump's Deportation Plans Will Turn Cops Into Immigration Agents"}, {"text": "Despite a decade of working to help America in Iraq, Hameed Khalid Darweesh was welcomed to the United States with handcuffs. Darweesh had received a special immigrant visa on January 20 for his work as a contractor, engineer, and interpreter for the Army's 101st Airborne Division in Baghdad and Mosul. But when he arrived at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday night, he was among the refugees detained upon arrival in the wake of President Donald Trump's latest executive order.  On Friday afternoon, Trump banned refugees from Syria indefinitely, suspended all refugee resettlement to the United States for 120 days, denied entry to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen), and reduced the number of refugees to be resettled this year by more than half. After nearly 19 hours of detention and a lawsuit filed on his behalf, Darweesh was released on Saturday. Countless others remain stuck in limbo.  While Trump's executive order claims to be in the interest of \"protecting the nation,\" experts in national security and counterterrorism who spoke with Mother Jones argue that it poses potentially disastrous immediate and long-term security threats to the nation and US personnel overseas.  \"At the exact moment we need them most, we're telling these people, 'Get screwed.'\"  \"Not only is it immoral and stupid, it's also counterproductive,\" says Patrick Skinner, a former CIA counterterrorism case officer who now works at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm. \"We've got military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel on the ground right now in Syria, Libya, and Iraq who are working side by side with the people, embedded in combat, and training and advising. At no time in the US's history have we depended more on localand I mean localpartnerships for counterterrorism. We need people in Al Bab, Syria; we depend on people in a certain part of eastern Mosul, Iraq; in Cert, Libya. At the exact moment we need them most, we're telling these people, 'Get screwed.'\"  Kirk W. Johnson, who spent a year on the reconstruction in Fallujah in Iraq with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), echoes Skinner's fears: \"This will have immediate national security implications, in that we are not going to be able to recruit people to help us right now, and people are not going to step forward to help us in any future wars if this is our stance.\"  The US-led war on ISIS is but one front in a constellation of fights against extremist groups that could be hampered by Trump's decision. \"The US is officially banning people in these countries at the same time we're trying to build up local support to fight ISIS,\" Skinner says. \"It takes a long time to build trust with these people. This is like the Abu Ghraib thing. You have to start over, say, 'Okay, starting now, trust me.' How many times can you get away with that?\" It also sends a message that groups like the so-called Islamic State can exploit. Elizabeth Goitein, the codirector of the Brennan Center's Liberty & National Security Program, says, \"The message this projects is that America sees Muslims as a threatnot specific actors who are intent on committing terrorist acts. The message that America really is at war with Islam will be ISIS's best friend.\"  BuzzFeed reporters Mike Giglio and Munzer Al-Awad spoke with five current or former ISIS fighters who cited Trump's divisiveness as a factor that will weaken America. They added that his rhetoric against Muslims will help them reinforce their narrative that America and the West are fighting not just terrorism, but Islam itself. \"Trump will shorten the time it takes for us to achieve our goals,\" said one.  Meanwhile, the very allies who have operated alongside US personnel in war zones for yearscontractors and translators like Darweeshare once again being abandoned. For the past decade, Johnson has been leading an effort to resettle Iraqi allies, many of whom, he says, face torture, kidnapping, and death after collaborating with American soldiers. It all started in 2006 when he heard from an Iraqi USAID colleague who'd been identified by a militia. The militia left a severed pig's head on his door step, along with a message saying that it would be his head next. Despite his years of helping the United States, the US government offered no help, and he had to flee the country with his wife.  \"We are not going to be able to recruit people to help us right now. And people are not going to step forward to help us in any future wars if this is our stance.\"  Johnson discovered that there was no mechanism in place to help US allies like his colleague, and he began a personal crusade to change that. Since then, through legislation and a special immigrant visa platform, Johnson's efforts have helped thousands reach the United States, but the process is cumbersome, long, and often too late for the people who need it most. Johnson speaks of interpreters \"who were having legs shot off, cut off, their wives raped, their children abducted.\" Some of his colleagues were even killed. And though Johnson has been critical of the process for years, now he's in the \"awkward position\" of defending it, because it was at least better than shutting those allies out as a matter of policy.  Skinner, Johnson, and Goitein all point out that the executive order reads as if whoever wrote it had no understanding of, or done any work with, US refugee admissions programs. Indeed, a senior Department of Homeland Security official reportedly told NBC News that career State Department and DHS officials had no input in the order, saying, \"Nobody has any idea what is going on.\" Johnson says, \"It reads as though 9/11 happened yesterday, and that 9/11 was carried out by refugees, which it wasn't, and it creates a series of policy prescriptions to solve a problem that doesn't exist, as if the stringent measures that have been put in place over the past 15 years to screen refugees don't exist.\"  Johnson, exasperated at the thought of US allies being turned away by the very country they spent years helping, adds, \"These people who are directly and immediately impacted by this have done more to help our country than just about every breathing American hasespecially the president.

On March 23, 1983, President Ronald Reagan took to the airwaves to announce the first steps toward building an ambitious defense system that would protect America from nuclear annihilation. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) called for an array of space-based lasers that could knock incoming Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) right out of the sky. The fanciful, technologically implausible concept was immediately lampooned as \"Star Wars.\" Yet over the next three-and-a-half decades, the federal government sank more than $239 billion (in 2016 dollars) into making some version of this Cold War daydream into reality, without much success.  Now it's Donald Trump's turn. Under the banner of \"Making Our Military Strong Again,\" the president has pledged to \"develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system to protect against missile-based attacks from states like Iran and North Korea.\" Stopping a nuke from Pyongyang may sound more realistic than shooting down hundreds of Russian missiles, but there's still a long way to go. The existing missile defense system, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, \"is hugely expensive, ineffective, and offers no proven capability to protect the United States.\"  Here's a brief history of Star Wars' prequels and sequels.  1957 The Soviet Union tests its first ICBM. Four months later, the United States successfully launches its first ICBM and begins work on its first anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, which would use nuclear-tipped interceptors to destroy incoming enemy warheads in space. 1961 The Soviet Union successfully intercepts a ballistic missile. It and the United States spend the next decade researching and testing ABM defense systems. 1972 The United States and the USSR sign the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, limiting each country to two ABM sites and no more 100 ABMs. A later amendment to the treaty limits each country to just one missile site. 1983 In a national television broadcast, Reagan announces that the United States will develop a space-based missile defense program that would render nuclear weapons \"impotent and obsolete.\" The system is a potential violation of the ABM Treaty. Seen as technologically unachievable, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) becomes known as \"Star Wars.\"  1991 President George H.W. Bush scales back the SDI program and announces the Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) system, aimed at countering small or accidental attacks. The plan, which calls for putting thousands of small interceptor rockets into orbit around the earth, is quickly canceled. 1993 Secretary of Defense Les Aspin declares \"the end of the 'Star Wars' era\" with the launch of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which focuses on regional, rather than intercontinental, missile defense. 1999 After nearly a decade of research and continued calls for a national missile defense system from Republican members of Congress, President Bill Clinton signs the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, committing the country to deploying a national missile defense system \"as soon as technologically possible.\" Clinton won't say when that might actually be. North Korea fires a ballistic missile over Japan. 2000 Following a series of failed tests, the director of the Pentagon's Office of Test and Evaluation releases a devastating report on how the tests for the proposed defense system had been set up to ensure the perception of success. 2001 President George W. Bush outlines his vision for a renewed national missile defense program and announces his intention to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. Bush orders that missile defense capabilities are put into place within two years. The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program is exempt from the Pentagon's oversight and accountability standards in order to meet its deadline. 2002 Construction of six missile interceptor silos begins at Fort Greely, Alaska.

Their agenda: how to get around the federal government's de facto ban on researching the health impact of gun violence and get it done anyway.  \"The idea was to pull together a meeting to say, 'We have had no change in the number of firearm deaths and firearm injuries since 2000. It's become endemic,'\" says Sandro Galea, a physician, epidemiologist, and the dean of the BU School of Public Health, who organized the hush-hush meeting. \"There has been no action on this to speak of at the federal level, and there has been no clear statement from academic public health on this issue. We brought people together to ask, 'What should academic public health be doing toward moving us collectively toward mitigating the consequences of gun violence?'\"  Despite the more than 30,000 gun-related deaths that occur in America every year, firearms receive relatively little attention as a subject of public-health research. A recent research letter published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that gun violence is the least-researched leading cause of death in the United States. This is largely because of a 1996 bill that prevented the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies from using federal money to \"advocate for or promote gun control.\" The lack of funding combined with the toxic environment that surrounds the debate over gun rights has made most public-health researchers wary of touching the topic.  The group that met at BU in November hope to reverse that two-decade trend. They drafted a call to action, the final version of which was published yesterday in the American Journal of Public Health. It outlines a plan to beef up gun violence research and scholarship by seeking funding from the private sector, as well as seeking common ground between pro-gun advocates and gun safety advocates, and developing state-level initiatives.  \"Federal funding is not going to happen with the National Rifle Association around,\" says John Rosenthal, a Massachusetts-based businessman and gun owner who was a keynote speaker at the November meeting. In 1994, he started Stop Handgun Violence, which has advocated stricter gun laws in his home state. (Massachusetts has the lowest gun violence rate in the nation, and some of its toughest gun laws.) \"In the absence of public funding, this call to action could lead to significant private funding,\" he says. \"If enough schools of public health really look at itand this is a public health epidemicthen lives will be saved. I think there will be a critical mass with this group and more that will follow.\"  \"It is very charged when you have the NRA calling you out personally. It has a chilling effect.\"  Galea says gun researchers have a lot of catching up to do. \"The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done,\" he says. \"It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources.\"  Even if the researchers overcome these financial obstacles, they must still contend with the political climate. \"Trump was a clear supporter of gun rights throughout the campaign and has widely claimed support from the gun lobby as a core part of his appeal; the gun lobby spent more than $30 million on the campaign,\" they write in their call to action. \"This portends challenges to advancing gun policy at the federal level in the next four years, if not longer.\"  The NRA has called out Galea for his \"deeply flawed research,\" likening his defense of a controversial recent study of gun laws to \"the behavior of a mule.\" \"It is very charged when you have the NRA calling you out personally,\" Galea says. \"It has a chilling effect. It's hard to encourage young people to make a career out of studying something which brings with it the threat of a public fight with a group as powerful as the NRA.\" After 20 years of delay, Rosenthal says it's time to stop ignoring one of the country's leading causes of death. \"We've reached a tipping point,\" he says. \"Enough is enough.\"", "date": "2017/01/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/gun-violence-research-public-health", "title": "Congress Gutted Researchers' Ability to Study Gun Violence.

A 1996 appropriation bill banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using any funds to \"advocate or promote gun control,\" which was interpreted as meaning any type of research on firearms deaths was prohibited. Soon afterwards, other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, were subject to the same requirements. Twenty years later, there remains a dearth of information on the public-health effects of gun violence, despite the more than 10,000 gun homicides that occur every year and their staggering costs.  Last week, David E. Stark, a physician and professor from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Nigam H. Shah, a researcher at Stanford University, published a research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) that puts the issue in bleak terms: \"In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death.\" Stark and Shah found that just $22 million in federal funds went towards researching gun violence between 2004 and 2015. If it the research had been funded at the same rate as other leading causes of death, gun violence research would have received $1.4 billion, they calculate.  For example, gun violence kills about as many people as sepsis annually. Yet, federal funding for gun violence research was less than 1 percent of that for sepsis over the 11-year period studied. And less common causes of death, including fires, malnutrition, anemia, and viral hepatitis, got much more research funding. \"Given that gun violence disproportionately affects the young and inflicts many more nonfatal injuries than deaths, it is likely that the true magnitude of research funding disparity, when considering years of potential life lost or lived with disability, is even greater,\" the researchers write.

Sure enough, on the first day of the new session of Congress, Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) introduced the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.  Hudson, a member of President-elect Trump's Second Amendment Coalition, isn't the first lawmaker to introduce a national reciprocity bill that would effectively override many existing state gun laws. But his bill is broader than its predecessors. Gun advocates have typically couched the need for reciprocity as a convenience to travelers who must contend with a \"patchwork\" of gun laws while on interstate road trips. Hudson's bill, however, goes far beyond making travelers' concealed-carry permits portable across state lines. It would also force states to allow residents with a concealed-carry permit issued in another state to pack heat. Additionally, it would allow gun owners from states that do not require concealed-carry permits to carry weapons in states that do require permits.  These provisions are significant. Many previous reciprocity bills would not allow residents of permit-free states to carry in states with stricter policies. Moreover, Hudson's bill includes a loophole for gun owners who can't obtain a concealed-carry permit in their own state. \"Under Hudson's bill, a California resident who cannot get a concealed-carry permit in California can easily get one from Utah, and then carry guns in California without ever setting foot in Utah, and not for some short duration like a tourist stay, but for the rest of his life and every day,\" explains Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. \"The real impact of the Hudson bill is not to protect interstate travelers. It's to require states with restrictive concealed-carry policies to allow their own residents to carry guns.\"  \"Let's face ittourists carrying their guns across state lines is not the biggest issue even for gun advocates. What they really oppose are restrictive concealed-carry policies.\"  Anyone can get a Utah-issued concealed-carry permit by taking a gun safety class certified by the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identification. (Two-thirds of people with Utah concealed-carry permits live outside the state.) Getting a Virginia permit is even easier: Answer 15 of 20 questions correctly after taking an online course and you're set. Applicants get four attempts to pass. Nine states already have \"constitutional carry\" laws that allow carrying a concealed gun without any training or permit. Forty states recognize some or all concealed-carry permits from other states.  Trumpwho has said he sometimes carries a concealed weaponhas called for making concealed-carry permits like driver's licenses, which are valid nationwide. He said concealed carry is \"a right, not a privilege.\"  Aligning with the belief among pro-gun advocates that \"gun-free zones\" facilitate mass shootings, the new bill also would override the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which makes it a federal crime to carry a gun in a school zone. This is in keeping with Trump's campaign promise to \"get rid of gun-free zones on schools.\" Last January, he suggested he would sign legislation that would undo any restrictions on guns in schools: \"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"  On Wednesday, the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action came out in support of the Hudson bill, applauding it as \"a much needed solution to a real problem for law-abiding gun owners.\" Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA-ILA, framed the bill in terms of \"the fundamental right to self-defense while traveling across state lines,\" but did not address its wider implications. \"Let's face ittourists carrying their guns across state lines is not the biggest issue even for gun advocates,\" Winkler says. \"What they really oppose are restrictive concealed-carry policies in places like California, New York, and Maryland.\"  Lindsay Nichols, a senior attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, believes the new reciprocity bill may pose a constitutional challenge to states' long-standing authority to protect their citizens by regulating guns. \"This removes the protections that the states have provided to their citizens,\" she says. \"It's a really radical notion, and there are some questions about whether the federal government can deprive states of that authority.\"  Previous efforts to pass national reciprocity legislation have failed. In 2013, a more moderate bill was voted down narrowly in the Senate. Nonetheless, Nichols predicts, \"it's not going to be easy for them to pass this.\" She expects congressional Democrats to \"toe the line\" against the measure. On Monday, a week after Hudson introduced his bill, Chris Cox admitted on NRATV that getting national reciprocity will be no easy task, but told viewers that by engaging supporters and keeping pressure on the Senate, \"we have a real opportunity.\" Winkler foresees a fight, especially since the national reciprocity bill is a major item on the NRA's wish list. \"For the last 30 years, the NRA has led a major push to loosen concealed-carry laws,\" he says. \"There are a few holdouts that have resisted the NRA. Hudson's bill is designed to win that final battle.\"  This post has been updated.", "date": "2017/01/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/national-reciprocity-guns-concealed-carry-trump", "title": "Trump Wants to Allow Concealed Weapons Everywhere\u0089\u00db\u00d3This Bill Would Do That"}, {"text": "A vendor's display at a gun show in Miami on Jan. 9, 2016.  Is the case for background checks for gun buyers gaining momentum? In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Tuesday, public health researchers from Harvard and Northeastern universities found that 22 percent of all gun sales in the past two years around the United States were conducted without background checksnearly half as many as previously thought. The new study asked 1,613 gun owners about when and where they acquired their most recent firearm, and whether they were asked to show a firearm license or permit, or to pass a background check. (The researchers note that the self-reporting study may have limitations, as it is based on the respondents' memory rather than documentation.) The study is the first national survey of its kind since 1994, when an extrapolation from a survey of 251 gun owners estimated that 40 percent of all guns sales occurred without any background checks.  Yet, despite the lower percentage shown by the research, many Americans continue to purchase guns through so-called private sales with no official scrutiny: According to the study, 50 percent of people who purchased firearms online, in person from an individual, or at gun shows did so without any screening. That occurs most often in states with looser regulations on sales, where 57 percent of gun owners reported buying guns without background checks, compared to 26 percent in the 19 states that now mandate universal background checks.  The decades-old 40-percent figure was long a point of contention in the gun debate, criticized by gun groups as false (the NRA called it a \"lie\"), yet also widely cited among researchers and policymakers in the absence of any updated studies.  Despite a lack of federal legislation regulating private gun sales, the study's authors suggest that state and local efforts to mandate universal background checks are making progress. And Philip Cook, a Duke University gun violence researcher who conducted the 1994 survey, told The Trace that the new results should be encouraging for advocates of stricter gun laws. \"The headline is that we as a nation are closer to having a hundred percent of gun transactions with a background check than we might have thought,\" he said. Referencing his previous survey, he noted that the updated figures mean \"it's more attainable, and cheaper, to pass a universal requirement than it would be if 40 percent of transactions were still being conducted without these screenings.\"  Studies have shown that background checks can help curb gun violence, as well as limit interstate gun trafficking; it's been well documented that guns originating in states with lax gun regulations inundate states with tougher laws and fuel gun crime. But even with a solid majority of Americans now undergoing background checks, the researchers note that millions of Americans continue to acquire guns free of any government oversight.", "date": "2017/01/04", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/fewer-americans-are-buying-guns-without-background-checks", "title": "Fewer Americans Are Buying Guns Without Background Checks Than Previously Thought"}, {"text": "This story first appeared in ProPublica.  Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and the heir to a family real estate empire, has emerged as perhaps Donald Trump's closest adviser. A near-constant presence by Trump's side, his portfolio includes business, tax, political, and foreign policy matters.  Last month his lawyers outlined a plan under which they said Kushner would avoid any possibility that his White House work would overlap with his business interests.  The plan didn't have much detail. But newly released documents and statements from the White House are making the picture clearer: Kushner is keeping parts of his family business.  Kushner retains some real estate holdings associated with Kushner Companies, a White House spokesperson said in an email.  Kushner has divested ownership of a number of Kushner Companies businesses and one large Manhattan office building, the White House spokesperson said. But the White House and a Kushner Companies spokesman declined to say what Kushner is keeping and what he has given up.  Kushner's decision to keep some of his business, ethics lawyers say, raises questions about how he will recuse himself from government matters that could affect his own bank account.  Kushner Companies has also had relationships with a number of large financial firms such as Goldman Sachs that will likely be affected by Trump administration policies.  \"What mechanism will the White House use to ensure that Kushner will not participate in matters that affect his retained financial interests?\" asked Kathleen Clark, an ethics law expert and professor at Washington University School of Law. \"We, the public, should have information about what types of matters Kushner is going to have to recuse from.  Given the sprawling and complicated nature of the Kushner family business, the issue is not academic.  The New York Times recently explored Kushner Companies' dealings with a Chinese firm that has ties to that country's government. Kushner Companies has also had relationships with a number of large financial firms such as Goldman Sachs that will likely be affected by Trump administration policies.  Kushner Companies' real estate holdings are intertwined with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that may face an overhaul during the Trump administration, as Bloomberg recently reported.  Asked about Kushner's plan to avoid conflicts, White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not offer any specific areas that he will recuse himself from. She said in an email:  \"Like other government employees, Mr. Kushner will recuse from particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his financial interests and will comply with financial disclosure requirements.  Here's why recusals are needed and how they work  Kushner was hired as an executive branch employee, so he must comply with the law that makes it a crime for an official to work on a government matter that will affect his financial interests. (As president, Donald Trump is, famously, exempt from that law.)  People entering the government have two primary ways of resolving conflicts: selling off the assets that may pose a conflict, or keeping ownership and recusing themselves from government matters that could affect the holdings.  For officials like Kushner who hold onto assets, there is usually a memo outlining areas of recusal, ethics lawyers say. Sometimes there is a screening process so the official isn't invited to, say, a meeting on a matter that would affect their holdings.  \"There would likely be some written documentation of at least the overall understanding of the kinds of matters in which an individual White House official would not participate,\" said ethics specialist Robert Walker of law firm Wiley Rein, speaking of the general practice, not about Kushner specifically.  For Kushner, the White House Counsel's Office will be in charge of monitoring compliance with the conflict of interest law and, in case of any violations, making a criminal referral. High-profile prosecutions under the law are rare but not unheard of. A Bush-era Food and Drug Administration commissioner pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges stemming from his ownership of stocks in companies regulated by the agency.  Among its best-known holdings are 666 Fifth Avenue, a Manhattan office tower purchased for $1.8 billion in 2007 and the former Jehovah's Witness Watchtower headquarters on the Brooklyn waterfront.  Trump's White House Counsel is Don McGahn, an attorney best known for his deregulatory fervor during his stint as Federal Election Commissioner. \"The multiple ethics problems swirling around the White House are squarely McGahn's responsibility,\" wrote Harvard Law professor and former Bush Administration official Jack Goldsmith in a blog post last week.  Here's what we now know about the state of Kushner's business holdings  While the White House would only say that Kushner retains some real estate holdings, Kushner does have to file a financial disclosure form that will give more details about what he owns. The filing should be made public in the coming weeks or months. That filing may also shed light on what assets Kushner divested in the preceding year.  Kushner Companies is privately held so the full extent of the business is not clear. The company says it owns or manages 20,000 apartments and 13 million square feet of office and retail space in six states.  Among its best-known holdings are 666 Fifth Avenue, a Manhattan office tower purchased for $1.8 billion in 2007; the former Jehovah's Witness Watchtower headquarters on the Brooklyn waterfront; and the building in midtown Manhattan that used to house The New York Times.  Kushner has divested from 666 Fifth Avenue, according to both the White House and Kushner Companies spokesman James Yolles.  \"He has also divested from numerous Kushner Companies businesses and has no role in the management or operations of Kushner Companies,\" Yolles said in an email.  Neither Yolles nor the White House would provide more details.  Kushner has also stepped down as chief executive of the family company.  The new documents, from the Office of Government Ethics, show that Kushner has sold his interest in seven entities, some of which are associated with Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm run by his brother, Joshua. (Thrive has investments in Oscar, the health insurance company.)  Last month, Kushner's attorneys told reporters that he would divest from 35 investments. It's not clear whether all of those divestitures have been made or what the remaining investments are.  Kushner's attorneys said that some of those assets would be sold to Kushner's brother and a trust controlled by his mother. That arrangement raised the eyebrows of some ethics experts, with one describing it as a \"shell game.  Under the conflict of interest law, government employees must also avoid conflicts that could arise from their spouse's assets. Kushner's attorneys previously said that his wife, Ivanka Trump, would divest some assets. But again the details are unclear.  Government ethics office documents show Ivanka Trump divested shares in a handful of securities. But it's not clear if Ivanka Trump has sold other holdings, such as her stake in the Trump Organization's hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C. That hotel is run under a lease with the federal government, which could create another conflict for Kushner.  The Office of Government Ethics warned Kushner's attorneys about the unpredictability of ethics issues, according to heavily redacted email exchanges, which were first reported by MSNBC.  \"Ethics issues arise unexpectedly, and they don't come with the label Caution! I'm an ethics issue,'\" wrote agency director Walter Shaub, continuing:  \"White House appointees are at the mercy of the attention span of a White House Counsel's office with a thousand other things to do. As things are currently shaping up, it's not clear that this new White House will have a fully functioning ethics office of its own on the first day. For that reason, caution is advisable. The further you can put [Kushner] back from the line, the better you will protect him.\"  Derek Kravitz contributed to this report.", "date": "2017/03/02", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/white-house-power-player-jared-kushner-keeping-parts-his-real-estate-empire", "title": "Keeping With Family Tradition, Jared Kushner Won't Cut His Business Ties"}, {"text": "A Border Patrol agent near the US-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona  Last week, the Trump administration released its blueprint for implementing the president's executive orders on immigration. Not only did it lay out plans to vastly increase the number of undocumented people vulnerable to deportation, but it also revealed that the feds intend to deport many more people caught in their immigration crackdown immediately after their arrest.  \"Expedited removal\" is the term the government uses to describe the swift deportation of undocumented immigrants without an appearance before an immigration judgeand, as pro-immigrant advocates point out, without due process protections. Previously, only undocumented immigrants who had been in the United States for less than 14 days and were apprehended within 100 miles of the US border were eligible for expedited removal. According to a new memo signed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, expedited removal can now be applied nationwide to those who cannot produce documentation that they have been in the country continuously for at least two years.  Jennifer Chang Newell, a senior staff attorney on the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said expedited removal has long been marred by widespread, well-documented abuse and that it \"violates due process absolutely.\" In 2014, the last year for which there are public statistics, 176,752 people were given expedited removal orders. That number, advocates point out, is now sure to go up.  In 2014, 176,752 people were given expedited removal orders. That number, advocates point out, is now sure to go up.  The expansion of expedited removal is part of the administration's attempt to bypass the bottleneck of immigrants already awaiting deportation in the immigration court system. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) estimates that it has the capacity to deport 400,000 people annually, but there is currently a backlog of more than 500,000 cases in the courts. Expedited removal allows the administration to skip the courts and summarily deport people without a lawyer, or even a phone call.  Under the new plan, apprehended immigrants will be asked for proof (such as receipts, phone records, or identification) that they have been in the country over the past two years. If they can't produce the necessary documentation, they will be deported in as little as 24 hours. In effect, Newell said, \"the police officer who arrests you and interrogates you also convicts you.\" While this obviously is a concern for the tens of thousands of immigrants estimated to have illegally crossed the border since 2015, Alyson Sincavage, a legislative associate at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), argues that it could affect all undocumented immigrants who can't immediately make their case to immigration officialseven those who've been here for years. (ICE did not respond to a request for comment.)  And then there's the question of how this might influence asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. Since 2014, there has been a surge of Central American immigrantsmany of them unaccompanied minors or women with childrencrossing the southern border due to increased gang violence and instability in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Both Newell and Sincavage expressed concerns that this group, many of whom have valid asylum claims, could be wrongly slated for expedited removal in the general chaos of a large-scale immigration overhaul. A 2013 study by the ACLU found that some asylum seekers were quickly deported because Customs and Border Protection agents failed to adequately screen them in so-called credible-fear interviews, which immigrants must pass before getting a full hearing before an immigration judge. (The Trump administration has indicated that CBP agents should \"elicit all relevant information from the alien as is necessary to make a legally sufficient determination\" during credible-fear screenings; CBP did not respond to a request for comment.)  In effect, the ACLU's Jennifer Chang Newell said, \"the police officer who arrests you and interrogates you also convicts you.\"  Causing further concern, the administration has suggested that many immigrants apprehended at the border could be immediately sent back to Mexico, rather than to their home countries. Luis Angel Gallegos, a program coordinator at the Institute for Social and Cultural Practice and Research, a Mexico City-based nonprofit focused on migrant issues, wrote in Spanish that sending immigrants to northern Mexico would present an enormous logistical challenge and endanger already-vulnerable immigrants. \"There is no infrastructure to host and receive them,\" he said. \"Shelters that help immigrants are often full. Immigration detention centers are full.\" Gallegos argued that this could make immigrants targets for extortion, kidnapping, and other crimes by the criminal syndicates operating in the border region.  Even if the Mexican government blocks this part of the planon Friday, the Associated Press reported that Mexico's interior secretary said the country had rejected it in meetings with American leadersNewell and Sincavage stressed the cruelty of removing people so quickly without a phone call, let alone a day in court. Expedited removal leads to people being \"ripped from their communities [and] whisked away and deported in a matter of hours, based on shoddy paperwork,\" Newell said. \"This violates our most American notions of fairness.\"", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-deportation-ice-border-patrol-expedited-removal", "title": "Donald Trump Can Deport People Without Even Giving Them a Hearing"}, {"text": "A naturalization ceremony in San Diego  President Donald Trump's opposition to illegal immigration is well known. But since his inauguration, he has also attempted to overhaul legal immigration, most notably with his executive order barring travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Speculation about other ways the president could restrict legal immigration have been fueled by his statements as well as leaked draft memos. Additionally, there are concerns surrounding potential conflicts of interest between the president's businesses and his immigration policy, since some of the Trump's companies rely upon visas that he now controls.  Few people understand the United States' notoriously labyrinthine immigration system. The confusion is understandable. The State Department lists 76 visa categories that fall under two umbrellas: non-immigrant visas, for those seeking to come to the country for a fixed period, and immigrant visas, for those seeking a path to citizenship.  Here are some of the visas issued by the US government and what we know about Trump's plans for them:  EB-5: The \"millionaire\" or \"investor\" visa  EB-5 holders are required to make a minimum business investment of $1 million (or $500,000 in a \"high unemployment\" or rural area), creating at least 10 jobs. This visa is controversial: Some argue that it allows foreigners to buy citizenship. Others suggest that these visas are processed too quickly, potentially opening the door to money laundering and other security risks. Earlier this month, Sens. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) cosponsored a bill to end the program.  As Bloomberg reported, Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, owns an apartment complex that has taken $50 million in EB-5 funds, mostly from Chinese investors. Trump has not commented on this visa program.  H-1B: Highly Skilled worker visa  H-1Bs allow foreigners who work in a \"specialty occupation,\" such as technology, engineering, mathematics, or business, to work in the country for three years. (They may renew their visas an additional three years so long as they remain employed.) The worker must have an employment agreement with an American company. The number of H-1Bs is capped at 85,000.  Trump's stance on H-1Bs has varied. He used harsh language about them on his website, but then in a campaign debate said, \"I'm softening the position [on his website] because we have to have talented people in this country.\" He then hardened his position again in a press release, stating that \"I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\" In his inauguration speech, Trump said, \"We will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.\" This has raised questions about how a \"hire American\" requirement might impact American businesses that rely on skilled foreign employees, particularly Silicon Valley.  According to a draft executive order obtained by Bloomberg, Trump has plans to overhaul this visa program. The draft order sparked a wave of panic in India's technology sector, whose workers are the top recipients of H-1Bs. According to executive order drafts leaked to Vox, one of the ways Trump could alter this visa would be to stop the spouses of H-1B holders from working in the United States and restricting these visas to companies that are \"the best and the brightest,\" which presumably means only largest and most successful American companies.  H-1B3: The \"model visa\"  This visa is a subset of the \"highly skilled workers\" visa. When the immigration system was reformed in the 1990s, the modeling industry expressed concern that while supermodels were covered by the O-1 visa (see below), non-supermodels were left out. The \"model visa\" was created.  First Lady Melania Trump originally worked in the United States on such a visa, and has cited it as proof that she immigrated legally and that others should follow her example. Trump's modeling agency, Trump Model Management, has benefited from hiring foreign models using this visa. However, as Mother Jones reported last year, some of the company's models say they came to the United States on tourist visas, which did not allow them to work legally. A Trump Organization executive did not deny the claims.  H2: Seasonal worker visa  H2s allow companies to temporarily hire agricultural workers or other workers without advanced degrees, such as waiters and housekeepers, provided that employers prove that they could not fill these position with citizens.  According to the Washington Post, Trump's vineyard in Charlottesville, Virginia, recently applied for six H-2A visas. As BuzzFeed reported last week, the vineyard applied for nearly two dozen more earlier this month. Similarly, Trump's Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago resort requested 78 H2B visas for foreign servers, housekeepers, and cooks. When asked about this at a debate last March, Trump said, \"It's very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing_There's nothing wrong with it. We have no choice.\" Perhaps that was a signal that he'll leave this visa alone.  F-1: Student visas  These visas allow students to travel to the United States to study at high schools, universities, seminaries, and other educational institutions.  Many students with F visas have been affected by the travel ban. As Mother Jones has reported, many college students were stranded by the ban while returning from winter break. Four thousand Iranian students will be affected should the ban remain in place. Fortune estimates that US colleges could lose $700 million annually if these students' tuition money dries up. Though Trump hasn't spoken specifically about changes to student visas, during his campaign, he has called for ending the J-1 visa program for visiting scholars and professors.  O-1: The \"artist\" or \"genius\" visa  This visa allows \"individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement\" to come to the United States to work in their field of expertise. This visa covers everyone from athletes and musicians to famous authors and Nobel Prize-winning scientists. (Athletes who are entering for a specific competition may enter on a P-1 \"athlete's visa.\")  If Trump's travel ban is upheld, celebrities from the seven specified countries could be affected. International disapproval of the ban could affect major events, such as Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics, which will be decided in September. According to ESPN, international soccer officials' disapproval of the president's travel ban could affect the United States's chances of hosting the World Cup in 2026.", "date": "2017/02/20", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-legal-immigration-visas", "title": "From Tech Workers to College Kids, Trump is Also Taking on Legal Immigrants"}, {"text": "Protesters march against President Trump's immigration executive order at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.  As the Trump administration rolled out its \"Muslim ban,\" detaining hundreds of travelers and sparking protests at airports across the country, the agency in charge of implementing the order was operating without a chief of staff. Who might get the No. 3 spot at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) remains a mystery despite reports that it will be an anti-immigration hardliner.  Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that President Donald Trump had named Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), as CBP's new chief of staff. That report was based on a tweet by an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, as well as a Politico story that reported that Kirchner was serving \"a temporary political appointment\" at CBP.  However, CBP has not officially named Kirchner or anyone else as its new chief of staff. After issuing several cagey responses to questions about the alleged appointment, the agency's press office confirmed that Kirchner is working as \"an advisor to the commissioner's office\" and \"her status hasn't changed.\" Attempts to reach Kirchner for comment were unsuccessful. Trump named his new chief of Border Patrol, Ronald Vitiello,* on Tuesday.  If Kirchner is indeed Trump's pick, it would be another sign that he's doubling down on his promises to crack down on immigrants. Like Trump, Kirchner has characterized immigrants and refugees as dangerous and costly. Last September, Breitbart published parts of a statement written by Kirchner, who was then working as an adviser to the Trump campaign. \"Before President Obama's failed presidency comes to an end, he is trying to force Americans to accept 30 percent more refugeesproviding ISIS a path for their terrorists to enter the country,\" she claimed. \"In recent years, hundreds of foreign born terrorists have been apprehended in the United States alone.\" She also wrote that \"instead of providing free healthcare to millions of refugees, we must focus on rebuilding our inner cities and bringing jobs back to America.\"  Kirchner claimed Obama's refugee policy was \"providing ISIS a path for their terrorists to enter the country.\"  Kirchner joined FAIR in 2005 as its director of government relations. In 2007, she became the organization's executive director. During her tenure, FAIR launched an initiative to end the 14th Amendment's birthright citizenship provision, which grants citizenship to all children born on American soil, regardless of whether their parents are legal residents. In 2010, FAIR's legal arm, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, had a hand in crafting Arizona Senate Bill 1070, which required police to detain individuals suspected of being illegal immigrants and made it a misdemeanor for immigrants not to carry their immigration papers. (The Supreme Court subsequently found most of SB 1070's provisions unconstitutional.)  FAIR describes itself as a nonpartisan organization focused on limiting all immigration. The Southern Poverty Law Center has characterized it as a \"hate group\" with nativist ties. In return, FAIR has called SPLC a \"basket of partisan propaganda artists masquerading as public policy advocates\" and has filed a complaint with the IRS alleging that the group is engaged in illegal political activity.  FAIR and its representatives have a history of taking extreme stands and making racially charged statements. In a 1997 Wall Street Journal article, Tucker Carlson quoted FAIR's current president, Dan Stein, as saying, \"Should we be subsidizing people with low IQs to have as many children as possible, and not those with high ones?\" One of FAIR's field representatives wrote in 2005 that Mexicans were at risk of turning California into a \"third world cesspool.\" FAIR's founder and former director John Tanton has warned of the \"Latin onslaught\" and has said the United States should remain a majority-white country, writing, \"One of my prime concerns is about the decline of folks who look like you and me.\" After a 2011 New York Times article exposed Tanton's racist statements and ties to Holocaust deniers, eugenicists, and racists, he quietly dialed back his role in the organization. He remains on its advisory board.  Trump's ties to FAIR also extend through Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, who conducted polling and research for the group beginning in the mid-1990s. Last December, Stein, FAIR's president, said Conway's work for FAIR had a visible impact on Trump's immigration policies: \"We saw that influence helping to shape Donald Trump's positions and statements once she came on board.\"  In August 2015, Kirchner left FAIR to join Trump's campaign as an immigration adviser. During her time with the campaign, Trump made his promises to build a massive border wall and implement a ban on \"Muslim immigration.\" Last August, Trump visited Arizona to deliver an inflammatory speech on immigration. \"We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate,\" he said. \"It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.\" Trump emphasized immigrants' ties to violent crime and claimed that illegal immigration costs the United States $113 billion annuallya figure taken from a debunked study published by FAIR under Kirchner's watch.

The mass release came three days after a Texas judge denied that center and another in Karnes, Texas, the licenses that would allow them to detain children, which they have been doing for more than two years.  \"These are facilities that you wouldn't put your dog in,\" said one lawyer working to close family detention centers.  As Ian Gordon reported for Mother Jones, after the surge in immigration across the United States' southern border in the summer of 2014, the Obama administration revived the family detention system, in which immigrant women and children are detained, sometimes for months on end, and in some cases for close to a year. Human rights advocates have strongly criticized the policy. As Gordon pointed out, the practice is both expensive and traumatic to the families, many of whom are asylum seekers who fear violence in their home countries.  Here's a rundown of the basics on how the Texas decision could affect family detention going forward:  So the recent ruling means both of those Texas family detention centers will close, right?  Not necessarily. The release in Dilley was a win for the movement to end family detention, but David Kolko, a Colorado immigration attorney who led the American Immigration Lawyer Association (AILA)'s national task force on family detention, said \"the legal question now is to what extent will the government comply [with the judge's ruling].\" The government immediately appealed the ruling, but Kolko pointed out that even if it loses the appeal, it's not clear what the penalty would be for continuing to house children.  Kolko explained that family detention centers in Dilley and Karnes, as well as the Berks Family Residential Facility in Pennsylvania, violate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which was the result of a decade of litigation over how to treat unaccompanied migrant children. It requires that children be held in licensed child care facilities, which Dilley is not. Berks was given a license that was later revoked, and the judge's December decision invalidated Karnes' license. In 2015, a federal judge agreed with Kolko's assessment, but still the centers remained open and continued to hold children.  How many people are in family detention centers now?  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) doesn't release detainment numbers, which makes it difficult to know exactly how many families are currently in family detention. This is compounded by the fact that the numbers are constantly changing as people are released or deported. But Kolko said that, based on estimates from his sources in Dilley, there were still 1,900 women and children in the detention center after the most recent mass release.  According to Customs and Border Protection, 2016 marked the biggest uptick in the arrival of women and children across US borders since 2014, when the initial wave began. Laura Lichter, a former AILA president who is part of a team of lawyers working on family detention centers, explained that when the surge happened in 2014, the Obama administration thought that the women were seeking work and that bringing a child would enable them to stay in the country. According to Lichter, the government thought that detaining and deporting them quickly would discourage others from coming. But actually, she said, most of these women and children were fleeing violence in Mexico and Central America. (ICE was unavailable for comment on this issue.)  \"When you start seeing women and unaccompanied children fleeing as migrants, that's when something really bad is going on,\" Lichter said. \"That's the least mobile demographic. You just don't see it unless it's life or death.\"  As Sara Rathod reported in Mother Jones, numerous studies have found that even short periods of detention affect children's mental health. Both Kolko and Lichter argued that the term \"family detention center\" is a misnomer. \"These are facilities that you wouldn't put your dog in,\" said Lichter.  How many of the detainees qualify for asylum?  Lichter estimated that the vast majority of the women and children do, but they have a hard time proving it. Immigration law is incredibly complex, and many of the women don't understand their rights and are vulnerable to pressure from officials who want to remove them quickly. This effect is compounded by the fact that many of them are suffering from PTSD and are sleep deprived. Lichter said that being detained and not having a lawyer are the two main reasons that refugees are denied asylum. It is for all these reasons that the AILA and other groups are working so hard to make sure these women and children have access to free legal aid.  \"The infrastructure has been built in order to detain large numbers of people,\" said one expert on family detention centers. \"It allows your mind to go to the worst places of what's possible.\"  There are other obstacles preventing the women from communicating their asylum needs, Lichter said. \"They might not feel comfortable talking to a male asylum officer about their sexual orientation, or having a child in the room and discussing the fact that the child is the product of a rape.\"  So could the recent decision be the beginning of the end of family detention?  It's certainly made advocates hopeful that family detention centers may soon fall out of favor. But for-profit prison companies won't give up family detention without a fight. CoreCivic, the private prison company formerly known as CCA that runs the detention center in Dilley, is the largest prison company in the United States. In 2014, as record numbers of Central American immigrants poured across the border, CoreCivic got a sweet deal from the government: a four-year, $1 billion contract to detain those immigrants. The most shocking part of the deal: CoreCivic gets paid no matter how many beds are filled. Even without this deal, Lichter explained, \"the profit margin is larger on detaining women and children versus men,\" likely because women and children don't require as many security mechanisms as men.  According to CoreCivic's own financial reports, the company took away a hefty $71.6 million in revenue from the facility in Dilley alone. As the Washington Post reported, CoreCivic gets 14 percent of its revenue from the facilityit's the only one of the company's 75 facilities that holds children. According to its earnings statements, the company experienced a 6 percent growth in revenue during 2015, which it said was \"primarily attributable\" to the detention center in Dilley.  The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that each detainee in a family detention center costs the government $266 per day, while alternatives such as home visits and check-ins at ICE offices or electronic monitoring devices can cost as little as 17 cents to $17 per day.  And then there's Trump.  Right. The president-elect has used harsh rhetoric about deportations, threatening to exceed even President Barack Obama's record removal rates. Kolko said he's concerned Trump could build on Obama's family detention practices and detain other groups, such as Muslims: \"The infrastructure has been built in order to detain large numbers of people. It allows your mind to go to the worst places of what's possible.\"", "date": "2017/01/12", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/family-detention-immigration-refugees-texas-dilley", "title": "Here's the Biggest Immigration Issue That Trump Isn't Talking About"}, {"text": "California schemin'  One of President Donald Trump's favorite threats is cutting federal government funding to states, cities, and other entities that refuse to cooperate with his policies. On January 25, he issued an executive order titled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" which warns \"sanctuary cities\" that they could lose federal funds if they continue to protect undocumented residents from deportation. After an appearance by Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California-Berkeley was canceled amid violent protests, Trump tapped out the following tweet:  If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017  And during a pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, Trump doubled down on California: \"If we have to, we'll defund_We give tremendous amounts of money to California. California in many ways is out of control, as you know.\"  Here's the thing: Trump can't just yank funding from states or cities or universities that upset him. Yet the matter is far from resolved: Several cities and one state have already filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over its threats, all but ensuring a battle that could end up before the Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know about the legal issues behind this fight.  Why can't the president withhold federal money from states or cities?  The short answer is that Congress, not the White House, has ultimate power over the federal purse. The president's budget requests may direct Congress how to allocate federal spending, but the matter is not entirely in his hands. And he has no authority to withhold or rescind spending that's already been authorized.  So couldn't Congress defund a state or city if the president asked it to?  Hypothetically, Congress could pass a law or budget bill that puts conditions on the federal funding provided to, say, out-of-control California. But numerous Supreme Court decisions protect state and local governments against this type of vindictive policymaking. When the federal government raised the national minimum drinking age to 21 in 1984, it prodded states into enforcing the new law by stipulating that any state that didn't comply would lose 5 percent of its federal highway construction funds. South Dakota wasn't happy about this and filed a lawsuit against the federal government. South Dakota v. Dole worked its way up to the Supreme Court, which found that the federal government can apply conditions to fundingwith a few limits. One of those limits is the stipulation that any conditional spending must not be \"coercive.\" As Justice William Rehnquist wrote, there is a point when \"pressure turns into compulsion,\" and a state might unconstitutionally be forced to comply because it needs the federal money to operate. Additionally, conditional funding can only apply to new money, not funding that's already been committed.  As a practical matter, states and cities receive federal money through hundreds of different appropriations bills and programs. If Trump and congressional Republicans wanted to effectively defund California, they would have to modify each federal spending provision that affects the state. Conceivably, they could pass a bill that instructs the Department of the Treasury to stop sending money to Sacramento, but that would spark an enormous constitutional crisis.  But aren't states and cities required to follow federal laws whether they like it or not?  Yesbut again there are limits. When the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of Obamacare in 2012, it also considered the law's expansion of state Medicaid programs. The Affordable Care Act had threatened to cut off all Medicaid funding to states should they fail to expand the program in accordance with its standards. Citing South Dakota v. Dole, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his opinion that this ultimatum was \"a gun to the head\" of the states. For many states, federal Medicaid money comprises more than 10 percent of total revenue, and losing that money would effectively cripple them. Six other justices agreed with Roberts on this point, and Medicaid expansion was left to the states.  What about the 10th Amendment?  The 10th Amendment of the Constitution says that any power not delegated to the federal government becomes the responsibility of the states. This is the basis of America's federal system, whereby states have the freedom to pass laws that are distinct from those passed by Congress.  The Supreme Court has long interpreted the 10th Amendment as the foundation for a check on federal power. Take the case of Printz v. United States. After Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, a Montana sheriff named Jay Printz challenged its requirement that local law enforcement agencies conduct background checks on gun buyers. He argued that Congress was acting outside of its authority to compel state-level officials to enforce federal law. In 1997, five Supreme Court justices, led by Antonin Scalia, agreed.  The Printz decision underscores what Duke University law professor Matthew Adler calls \"an external constraint upon congressional poweranalogous to the constraints set forth in the Bill of Rightsbut one that lacks an explicit textual basis.\" In other words, decades of Supreme Court rulings on the 10th Amendment have formed an effective check on federal power by the states. And that could mean that just as Printz was allowed to resist conducting federally mandated background checks, a court could find that officials in sanctuary states and cities are allowed to avoid enforcing federal immigration law.  Don't conservatives like the 10th Amendment more than progressives?  In the past, the 10th Amendment has provided cover for advocates of states' rights and efforts to resist federal civil rights efforts such as integrating schools. More recently, the 10th Amendment became a rallying cry for the Obama administration's opponents. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is a big fan of the 10th, and tea partiers and \"Tenthers\" invoked the amendment to push back against Obamacare and even call for secession.  Now it's liberals who are warming to the promise of the 10th Amendment. San Francisco's recently filed federal lawsuit against the Trump administration argues that, defunding aside, the anti-sanctuary-city executive order violates the 10th Amendment. The city claims that it is within its rights to not cooperate with federal authorities under the \"anti-commandeering\" precedent set in Printz, which says higher jurisdictions may not \"commandeer\" local resources to enforce federal rules. Likewise, Massachusetts has also invoked the 10th amendment against Trump's \"Muslim ban\" executive order. Several Boston suburbs have also cited the 10th in their lawsuits against the administration's sanctuary city order, as has Santa Clara County, California, the home of Silicon Valley. Last week, Portland's mayor issued a statement that the 10th Amendment protects its sanctuary city policies too.  How could this battle play out?  The feds depend on state and local officials to enforce their policies. The federal system is set up to encourage cooperation between state and federal officials. If that falls apart, Trump will have difficulty enacting his agenda. As Yale law professor Heather Gerken recently argued on Vox, \"Even if President Trump spends enough political capital to win this or that battle against blue cities and states, he cannot win the war. The federal government doesn't have the resources to carry out Trump's policies.\"  The funding question remains up in the air since Trump hasn't given any indication to how, exactly, he would defund cities and states. However, given that California is in the process of passing legislation that effectively makes the entire state a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, and given that its elected officials have been vocal about their opposition to Trump, we could see a California v. U.S. case in the near future if Trump tries to follow through. On Monday, state Attorney General Xavier Becerra reiterated his commitment to pushing back against Trump's defunding threat. \"We will fight anyone who wants to take away dollars that we have earned and are qualified for simply because we are unwilling to violate the Constitution under these defective executive orders,\" he said.", "date": "2017/02/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-california-defund-sanctuary-city-tenth-amendment", "title": "Here's Why Donald Trump Can't Defund \"Out-of-Control\" California"}, {"text": "This story originally appeared on ProPublica.  As most of the world knows by now, Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not tell the truth when he was asked during his confirmation hearings about contacts with Russian officials.  But Sessions isn't the only one. At least four other cabinet members made statements during their nomination hearings that are contradicted by actual facts: EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.  The statements were all made under oath, except those of DeVos. It is a crime to \"knowingly\" lie in testimony to Congress, but it's rarely prosecuted.  If you know of instances that we've missed, email us.  EPA Chief Scott Pruitt  The falsehood: Pruitt stated in testimony that he had never used a private email account to conduct business while he was Oklahoma's attorney general.  The truth: Fox News 25 asked the state Attorney General's office whether Pruitt had used a personal email. The answer was yes.  The Associated Press also received emails in response to a public records request showing Pruitt using a private account to conduct state business.  Pruitt's response: None.  Education Secretary Betsy Devos  The falsehood: DeVos said during her confirmation hearings that she has not been involved in her family's foundation, which has given millions of dollars to group that oppose LGBT rights.  \"You sit on the board,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., noted. DeVos responded, \"I do not.\"  The truth: As The Intercept has detailed, tax filings have listed DeVos as vice president of the foundation's board for 17 years.  DeVos' response: She said the foundation's nearly two decades of filings were the result of a \"clerical error.\"  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  The falsehood: In written testimony, Mnuchin denied that his former bank had used so-called \"robo-signing\" to improperly foreclose on homeowners. \"OneWest Bank did not robo-sign' documents,\" Mnuchin wrote.  The truth: As the Columbus Dispatch detailed, OneWest Bank employees frequently signed documents in bulk without proper review, which is what robo-signing is. One employee testified that she typically signed about 750 foreclosure documents per week. The Dispatch noted that a judge stopped three OneWest Bank foreclosures \"specifically based on inaccurate robo-signings.\" Reuters also detailed the bank's robo-signing back in 2011.  Mnuchin's response: A spokesman offered the following statement after the Dispatch's story: \"The media is picking on a hard-working bank employee whose reputation has been maligned but whose work has been upheld by numerous courts all around the country in the face of scurrilous and false allegations.\"  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price  The falsehood: During his confirmation hearings, Price insisted that the discount he got on a biotech stock was \"available to every single individual that was an investor at the time.\"  The truth: As the Wall Street Journal reported, fewer than 20 investors in the U.S. were offered the discount, including Price.  Price's response: Price did not respond to the Journal's story.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions  The falsehood: Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., asked Sessions whether \"anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.\"  Session responded: \"Sen. Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"  The truth: Yes, he did.  Sessions' response: His office's first statement: \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\"  An anonymous White House official gave a New York Times reporter a different take, saying Sessions and the ambassador did talk and \"had superficial comments about election-related news.\"  Sessions' spokeswoman later said Sessions often spoke with \"foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.\" Washington Post reporters asked all 26 members of the committee if they spoke to the Russian ambassador in 2016.

Siblings Angel Rayos-Garcia, 16, and Jacqueline Rayos-Garcia, 14, have been separated from their mother for weeks. In early February, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos was deported to her native Mexico in one of the first high-profile removals of the Trump presidency. After being caught with a fake Social Security number in 2008, Garcia de Rayos had checked in with immigration officials every year and was allowed to stay in the country. But in a February 8 meeting with immigration officials, she was detained, and her deportation was later met with protests.  Arizona Democrats Ruben Gallego and Raul Grijalva invited Angel and Jacqueline to the address, which happened to fall on their mother's birthday. Before Trump spoke, I talked with Angel, who said he has felt lonely since Guadalupe's deportation. A sophomore in high school, he likes English and criminology and one day wants to start a family business. He told me that he felt \"nervous, but determined\" to go to the president's address. \"We're going to get to see him, and he's going to see us,\" Angel said. \"He's gonna see the face of all immigrants.\"  Here's some more of our conversation:  Mother Jones: What has it been like since your mother was deported?  Angel Rayos-Garcia: It's been really hard, but I'm staying strong for her. The empty feeling of getting home and knowing she's not going to be home with you. It's been hard to concentrate at [school] knowing everything that's going on. Knowing that your mom is far away from and knowing that you are not going to get home to her anymore.  \"We came from Mesa, Arizona, just so he can see our face, the face of suffering families of the mass deportations that he is doing.\"  MJ: Have you spoken to your recently?  ARG: Yeah, I called her this morning to wish her a happy birthday. I said happy birthday and that I love her a lot and that I would call her later in the day.  MJ: What does she think of the fact that you're going to the address?  ARG: She told us that she's so proud of us and that we need to keep doing what's right not only for her, but for the community and for the thousands of families are in our position.  MJ: How is she doing?  ARG: Her mood is the same as ours, strong and motivated. We're staying strong for each other. We're all trying our best to [get her back].  MJ: What would you tell Trump if you could speak to him?  ARG: I'd tell him that he needs to stop separating families. There needs to be a change and that we're not scared. We came from Mesa, Arizona, just so he can see our face, the face of suffering families of the mass deportations that he is doing. He's not just targeting criminals like he says. He's targeting everyone in general.  \"He says he was going to target murderers and rapists, but he's targeting everyone.\"  MJ: Why do you say that?  AR: My mom is an example. He says he was going to target murderers and rapists, but he's targeting everyone. My mom showed up to her check-in. We knew what the risks were. We knew there was a high chance of deportation, but we wanted to take it to show everyone.  MJ: Did you ever think you'd be away from your mom like this?  AR: I knew it was a possibility, but I also know that everything happens for a reason and you always have to have hope. You always get through it no matter what. There's always a new tomorrow.  MJ: What would you say to other families being separated by deportation?  AR: What I would tell them is to stay strong, and we are all going to get through this together.

Last Night, He Attended Trump's Address to Congress."}, {"text": "It's been a tough last couple of weeks for immigrant-rights advocates. In early February, Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a series of raids across 12 states. More than 650 allegedly undocumented immigrants were arrested that week, creating panic and anxiety among migrant communities. The Department of Homeland Security said that 75 percent of the people detained in these raids were criminal immigrantsbut even if that is true, it means 25 percent of those detained had no criminal record.  Since the initial raids, ICE has arrested a domestic abuse victim seeking a protective order in Texas, a DACA recipient in Seattle who entered the country when he was 7-years-old, and a group of men outside of a church-based hypothermia prevention shelter in Virginia. A memo released Tuesday by Homeland Security provided further details on how the Trump administration will carry out immigration enforcement, with the new guidance essentially allowing the deportation of many more undocumented immigrants through expedited removala process in which someone person could be removed from the country on sight if they cannot provide proper documentation.  Immigrant-rights organizations are bracing themselves for the new challenges ahead under the Trump administration. \"We don't know exactly how the attacks will come or where,\" says Salvador Sarmiento, national campaign coordinator at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). \"If the first two weeks give us any sort of idea, they can easily ramp up deportations and they can hit record numbers. It's a world of difference when the federal government doesn't even pretend to have any sort of respect for basic notions of due process or rule of law.\"  In the face of these threats, activists are fighting back. Here's how Sarmiento's organization, along with other groups such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) and Puente Human Rights Movement, are preparing immigrant communities to defend themselves under the Trump administration.  \"Neighborhood defense\"  There is no single way undocumented people can be safe, but Francisca Porchas, organizing director with Puente, a grassroots migrant justice organization in Phoenix, says it will be important for communities to work together to keep a look out for ICE and gather information on raids these next few years. She says her organization will be launching committees across the Maricopa County in Arizona. The committees will be set up as a \"cop-watch\"-type network where neighbors can alert one another if federal immigration agents are in their area.  \"I think at this point, it's really going to be all about neighborhood defense and building tight networks of people looking out for each other,\" says Porchas. \"Trump is not going to let us know where he is going, what areas he is hitting and so I think the tighter that we are and the closer that we're working with each other the more we are going to be able to keep each other informed and protect each other.\" Puente had previously used neighborhood defense committees to combat former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was notorious for his extensive raids and has been accused of racially profiling Latinos.  \"One year ago, there were not a lot of organizations that were fighting for sanctuary cities and building neighborhood defense committees,\" says Sarmiento. \"Folks are kind of rediscovering: 'Oh, we need to talk to our neighbors and form a little working group to defend ourselves and be ready for whatever comes.'\" Similar models are also being used in other places around the country, such as Chicago.  Stopping the spread of false rumors  While neighborhood watches will be key for sharing information, organizers say it will be important that the information be accurate. The massive raids have led to a lot of rumors and misinformation going around social media. This is a result of high levels of anxiety among immigrant communities in the wake of Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and stepped-up immigration enforcement, advocates say. The confusion is creating challenges for organizations as they try to provide accurate information to their communities. \"I know organizations are like, 'Ugh, can people please stop spreading rumors on the internet,'\" Porchas says. \"People are being re-traumatized.\" .  Two groupsthe California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance (CIYJA) and ICE Out of CAhave created shareable infographics intended to help stem the misinformation and fear spreading on social media. \"This is an answer to the panic and anxiety the community is feeling now,\" says CIYJA's Luis Serrano. \"Right now we need to sit back, think, and really organize and create different sources and community based alternatives if things were to happen. But jumping to conclusions is not the right idea.\"  Informing immigrants of their rights  In order to deport people, ICE needs a probable cause, says NDLON Litigation Director Jessica Karp Bansal. \"Even after the memos on Tuesday, know your rights workshops are going to be essential for immigrant communities protecting themselves,\" Bansal says. The memo and the president can't take away people's constitutional rights, Bansal explains. With several reports that even immigrants with green cards and visas have been relinquishing their legal status, advocates believe that it is important for immigrants to know their basic legal rights. \"It is very important for folks to understand that they don't have to self-incriminate, that there is a due process here that they are afforded to,\" says Joseph Villela, policy director for CHIRLA. \"That is why it is important to understand that they should not sign anything that they do not understand and not say anything that might be used against them in proceedings. That's something that most of the folks that we've worked with do not know.\"  \"Yes, we are going to fight like hell to stop a lot of deportations. But the reality is we are also not going to be able to stop a lot of them, as well.\"  CHIRLA hosts a number of workshops in their offices and throughout neighborhoods in Los Angeles to help communities know the basics. For example, the group explains to immigrants that if ICE shows up at their house, they don't have to open their door unless the officers present a warrant. On CHIRLA's website, the organization offers a \"Know Your Rights\" video explaining the legal protections that immigrants have and printable cards with a message explaining those rights that they can attempt to use when confronted by ICE agents and law enforcement.  \"Any administration can come and go, the civil and constitutional rights of individuals remain,\" Villela says. \"I think that's what we are fighting for at the end of the day.\"  Bansal says \"know your rights\" workshops will have a greater importance under Trump. \"The memo, although it basically says Trump is going to unleash the full power of his deportation force on the country, actually makes it more important to know their rights because it means we're going to have a lot of poorly trained immigration officers pounding on people's doors.\"  Making sure immigrants have a plan B  \"Yes, we are going to fight like hell to stop a lot of deportations,\" says Porchas. \"But the reality is we are also not going to be able to stop a lot of them, as well.\" In its three-day defense courses against deportations, Puente is not just letting people know what their rights if they encounter ICE officers. The group is also training people on how to prepare legal documentation in advance in case they do get detained.  \"We have some casesminors who are US citizens whose parents were detained or deported then transferred to foster care because their parent did not pick them up from school,\" Villela says. \"We want to make sure the children stay with their family unit to the extent that can be possible.\" CHIRLA encourages undocumented immigrants to create a family plana guardianship letter that outlines who would gain custody of their children if the parents are forced to leave the country.  Puente also helps immigrants put together documents that help them figure out what do with the property they own, such as houses, in case they are placed in detention centers or deported. Porchas says it is important for undocumented immigrants to be prepared and not be in denial that the worst could happen. She points to the case of Guadalupe Rayos, who missed the cutoff mark to apply for DACA by four months. She'd had routine check-ins with ICE for years but was deported under the new administration.  Working with state and local policy  Bansal says one of the best ways organizations can help defend immigrants under Trump is through local and state policy. NDLON plans to work alongside lawmakers to make California a safe place for immigrants, supporting bills like SB 54, which would prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal immigration officials deport undocumented immigrants. The bill would also make public schools, hospitals, and courthouses safe places for undocumented immigrants. \"There is very clear precedent from the Supreme Court that the federal government cannot make local police act as immigration agents,\" Bansal says. \"The memo basically directed ICE to basically triple in size, but even then they are really heavily relying on state and local police to help them identify people for deportation.\"  Organizing Online  The internet has been a helpful tool for advocates to organize across the nation. Shortly after Trump was elected president, NDLON launched ALTOTRUMP.com (Spanish for StopTrump.com), where people and organizations can get a lesson on sanctuary policies and other resources, including sample meeting agendas aimed at helping people form community meetings to talk about how their community can get organized. Porchas thinks it is important for anti-deportation efforts to go beyond local communities. \"There are a lot of people reaching out to us who are not organizations, who are just barely trying to figure out how to defend themselves,\" she says. \"The world has got to see how this country is treating its immigrants. That is the value of making this so visible.\"", "date": "2017/02/24", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/how-communities-are-defending-themselves-against-raids", "title": "How to Fight Back Against Trump\u0089\u00db\u00aas Deportation Raids"}, {"text": "In memos released to the media Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security detailed how it will implement President Donald Trump's controversial executive orders on immigration, laying out a blueprint for how immigration and border agents can detain and deport vastly more undocumented immigrants.  The biggest shift from the Obama administration has to do with which undocumented immigrants are considered priorities for deportation. Under Obama, those who committed serious crimes were the main focus of immigration agents. The new memos instruct agents to remove any undocumented person with a criminal record, regardless of the offense.  Senior agency officials told reporters Tuesday that the directives would not affect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrrivals (DACA) program, which protects the young people known as Dreamers from deportation and provides them work permits.

Labor and immigration rights advocates are worried that the policies being rolled out by President Donald Trump will make life particularly difficultperhaps even dangerousfor an especially vulnerable worker population: immigrant day laborers.  Trump wants to target \"anybody that has any kind of ticket or infraction_That's the danger\" for day laborers.  In the executive order he signed on January 25, Trump prioritized the removal of undocumented \"criminal\" immigrants. Specifically, his interior enforcement plans call for the removal of undocumented immigrants who have been charged or convicted, or have even just \"committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,\" which could include everything from entering the country illegally to getting paid to work or driving without a license. Such a broad definition of criminalitythe order also tells immigration agents to focus on those who are a \"risk to public safety or national security\"has advocates for day laborers more than a little concerned.  \"What President Trump wants to do is increase that kind of enforcement and targetnot just certain crimes, but anybody that has any kind of criminal past, any kind of ticket or infraction,\" says Victor Narro, project director at the UCLA Labor Center. \"That's the danger\" for day laborers.  While reliable numbers are hard to come by, a 2006 national study of day labor estimated that 117,600 people seek this kind of work daily. The laborers often stand out on public streets near lumber yards or home improvement centers in the hope that a contractor or homeowner will hire them for help with heavy jobs such as landscaping, hauling, clearing, or moving.  This makes them highly visible to law enforcement. And while it is legal to solicit work in public in many cities, local ordinances banning loitering or jaywalking can get laborers ticketed and their names put into police databases. If undocumented immigrants are detained and fingerprinted, for whatever reason, they have more to fear. Under Secure Communities, a controversial and since shuttered Obama-era program, fingerprints were automatically sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose agents could ask local officials to hold undocumented immigrants for deportation.  And Trump isn't just bringing back Secure Communities. After the presidential election, the Los Angeles Times reported that administration hardliners want to vastly expand expedited removal, a process in which ICE can deport people without so much as a hearing. It is currently used only within 100 miles of the border to remove people who cannot show proper documentation.  Enforcement and backlash against undocumented workers \"is going to be much more violent...much more dramatic.\"  Already there have been reports of anti-immigrant vigilantes photographing and harassing day laborers and, in one incident, going into a labor center in Hollywood and taking pictures of signup sheets bearing laborers' names. \"Now it's going to be much more violent, much more explicit because of the xenophobia and very explicit racism that we see from this administration and from his supporters,\" National Day Laborer Organizing Network spokesman Armando Carmona told me. \"This is going to be much more dramatic.\"  In defiance of the Trump administration, Los Angeles city officials have agreed to draft a law that decriminalizes the work of street vendorsmany undocumentedwho sell hot dogs, fruit, and other foods on streets. For years, their actions were illegal. The next push by the city's pro-immigrant advocates is to convince officials to grant amnesty to those vendors who still face criminal charges in the hope of helping them avoid deportation. (Trump's order also calls for cities that don't comply with federal immigration law to lose discretionary federal funding.)  In any case, the threat of deportation and physical violence isn't going to stop people from seeking a livelihood, says labor organizer Salvador Reza, who works with day laborers in Phoenix. \"Day laborers are here to work. They need to work. In order to work, they will face the Minutemen, they'll face the racists, they'll face the police,\" he says. \"If you take Arizona as an example, we can fight it and we can win itbut it's just massive.\"  President Trump, adds Reza, \"is taking on the whole nation.\"", "date": "2017/02/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/day-laborers-donald-trump-executive-order-immigration-enforcement", "title": "These Could Be the Most Vulnerable Immigrants in Trump\u0089\u00db\u00aas America"}, {"text": "Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia from 2006 to 2016, had a crisis on his hands in September 2014. Russian security service agents crossed the border and kidnapped and detained Eston Kohver, an agent with Estonia's equivalent of the FBI. The Russian government accused Kohver of being a spy and sentenced him to 15 years in prison.  \"In order to get Russia, we are now_ destabilizing our own democratic system here with that kind of nonsense.\"  Ilves referred to the episode Thursday during his testimony at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russian disinformation and \"weaponization of information.\" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a staunch defender of President Donald Trump, opened his statement by diminishing the importance of connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials and said that controversy over the matter \"has reached the absurd level of attacks.\"  \"In order to get Russia,\" he said, \"we are now_destabilizing our own democratic system here with that kind of nonsense.\"  When Rohrabacher asked Ilves to provide examples of Russian military aggression, the former president referred to the border incident. Rohrabacher was unimpressed: \"So you had a situation of corruption at the border, one of your border guards disappeared. I mean military aggression? Has there been any cross-border, at all, military action on the part of the Russians in Estonia?\"  \"Well, we have constant violations of our border by military jets. That's one thing, and that's consistent,\" Ilves said, adding these incidents have \"massively increased in the last four years.\"  Rohrabacher explained that he had visited the Baltic states after hearing stories of Russian military aggression and found \"not one report of actual military aggression.\" He added that the United States has sent \"our tanks up there, having B-52 mock raids on Russia, over Estonia, toward the Soviet capital, in the name of stopping Soviet military aggression that never existed. This has got to stop or we're going to end up in war.\"  Echoing Trump's practice of equating Russia and the United States\"We have a lot of killers_you think our country is so innocent?\" the president said to Bill O'Reilly last month the 13-term congressman offered his own analysis of the similarities between the United States and Russia. \"We have engaged in some of these activities,\" he said. He then mentioned the Phoenix Program, a Vietnam-era US undercover program that employed torture and assassination to kill tens of thousands of Viet Cong suspects from 1968 to 1972, and other examples of American involvement in the internal affairs of other countries during the Cold War.  \"[Russia is] being run by tough guyssort of like Mayor Daley, in Chicago, is transported over to Russia.\"  \"Do you remember the Phoenix Program in Vietnam? I remember the Phoenix Program. I supported the Phoenix Program. We murdered hundreds of local officials. How about Allende? How about Diem? How about any number of people during the Cold War that we assassinated? That's wrong, it's wrong to do that, but please do not say that Russia is the only country that commits these kinds of crimes.\"  Rohrabacher also compared Putin to Richard Daley, the late mayor of Chicago, saying that Russia is \"being run by tough guyssort of like Mayor Daley, in Chicago, is transported over to Russia.\" Daley \"beat demonstrators up and did not represent anything what America was all about, but he was not some vicious dictator. He had been elected by his people and we would try to unelect him as well.\" He added, \"What's happening in Russia, of course, is you have a country watching out for its national interest.\"  After Rohrbacher's history lesson, Rep. Gerry Connolly, (D-Va.)* asked Ilves to expand on his answer about Russian aggression.  \"I didn't get to finish,\" the former president said, referring to the kidnapping of the Estonian official. \"That was a military action. Troops came over and kidnapped this guy.\" He then noted massive military exercises the Russians perform at borders in the region, and not just between Russia and Estonia. \"I mean, they do mock bombing raids on Sweden,\" he said. \"So it's not just us.\"  Connolly then addressed Rohbacher's comparison of Putin with Daley. \"I went to school in Chicago during his mayorality,\" Connolly said. \"I didn't know him, but I assure you, Vladimir Putin is no Richard Daley. Richard Daley did not have his political opponents assassinated. He didn't send them into exile. He didn't put them in prison. He didn't silence the press. He didn't assassinate members of the press. He didn't exile members of the press.

Trump's first attempt at a travel bansigned on January 27sparked major protests at airports around the country; key parts of the original order were ultimately blocked by federal judges.  The new order bars travelers from six countriesSudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemenfor 90 days, supposedly to give the administration time to improve vetting procedures for migrants. Travelers from those six countries who are outside the United States on March 16, the day the order takes effect, will be barred from entering the United States.  The new ban exempts Iraq, whose inclusion on the orginal list drew particular criticism. \"Iraq presents a special case,\" the order states. \"The close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq.\"  The new order also includes exceptions for people who are legal permanent residents of the United States, dual nationals with US citizenship, people attending diplomatic missions, and people who have already been granted asylum or refugee status.  In addition, the order suspends admission of refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, though it permits exceptions to be made on a case-by-case basis. It also lowers the overall number of refugees who can enter the country to 50,000 per year, down from the 110,000-refugee limit that existed under the Obama administration.  \"The United States has the world's most generous immigration system, yet is has been repeatedly exploited by terrorists and other malicious actors who seek to do us harm,\" the administration wrote in a fact sheet sent to Congress and published by the Washington Post. \"The 90-day period will allow for proper review and establishment of standards to prevent terrorist or criminal infiltration by foreign nationals.\"  Despite the changes, Trump's new order has provoked renewed outrage from immigrant rights groups.  \"The president has said he would ban Muslims, and this revised versionin these preliminary fact sheetsstill does that, even if they have removed Iraq from the list,\" Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association told the Post Monday morning.  Several Jewish groups criticized Trump's order Monday, including HIAS*a nonprofit organization that works with refugeeswhich used its Twitter account to slam the updated order. noting that the \"language has changed slightly, but the results are the same,\" the group wrote that there \"is nothing 'temporary' about a 120-day ban. It leaves innocent families stranded while their US-issued security clearances expire.

On February 22, the Moscow Times reported that the Russian government had \"created a new military unit to conduct 'information operations' against Russia's foes.\" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said, when announcing the unit, that \"propaganda should be smart, competent and effective.\" There's no concrete evidence yet, but it appears that Russia may be now attempting to weaken NATO and to divide Europe by destabilizing elections in France and Germany, two of the EU's strongest members.  \"This form of interference in French democratic life is unacceptable and I denounce it,\" Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's minister of foreign affairs, said on February 19 in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche, a French newspaper. \"The French will not accept that their choices are dictated to them,\" he said while discussing Russian actions in Europe and attempts to weaken non pro-Russian candidates ahead of the country's presidential election in May.  Ayrault was responding to reports that the Russian government may have been targeting the campaign of Emmanuel Macron, a centrist \"pro-liberal and pro-Europe\" candidate who has a chance of defeating Marine Le Pen, a right-wing nationalist, in the hotly contested French presidential elections this May. Le Pen has promised to pull France out of the European Union, and, much like Donald Trump, has advocated a better relationship with the Russian government. Macron's campaign has said its computer systems have been attacked, and that \"fake news\"that include allegations of a homosexual affair and attempts to connect Macron with American financial interests and Hillary Clintonhas been spread throughout France by Russian-owned media, such as Sputnik and RT.  Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at UCLA and an expert on Russian politics, says \"it certainly seems plausible\" that the Russian government would attempt to interfere in the European elections, as it's alleged to have done in the US.  \"[Putin] is quite skeptical about the possibility of building strong friendships or cooperation in the future with the elites of western Europe,\" Treisman tells Mother Jones. \"He feels that they've taken a very anti-Russian line, so he's reaching out to other forces who are also opposed to the European elites.\" Among those so-called Western European elites, are German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Macron in France. Part of Putin's plan could be to keep the west distracted \"with its own problems\" so it is \"less able to cohesively oppose what he's done in Ukraine,\" Treisman says.  The French government's top figures reportedly had internal discussions about cyber threats to its presidential election, and earlier this year the official in charge of security for the nation's ruling party told Politico that the country's leading politicians and political campaigns \"have received no awareness training at all about espionage and hacking,\" and that \"we are not at all up to the level of the potential threat.\" The Russian government has denied that it is working to meddle in the French elections, just as it denied meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.  \"We didn't have, and do not have, any intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmirtry Peskov told reporters on February 14. \"That there is a hysterical anti-[President Vladimir] Putin campaign in certain countries abroad is an obvious fact.\"  Worries aren't limited to the French elections, which will be held in April and May. The head of the German foreign intelligence service said in November that its next election cycle could be buffeted with the same sort of misinformation and cyber-attacks that plagued the US elections. \"We have evidence that cyber-attacks are taking place that have no purpose other than to elicit political uncertainty,\" said Bruno Kahl, the president of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (the German foreign intelligence service), according to the Guardian. Angela Merkel said at the time that \"such cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them.\" Merkel's hard line against Putin in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and strong support of the European Union are among the reasons that she could be targeted by Russia before her reelection vote in September.  And in the Netherlands, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders told Politico on January 12 that he didn't have \"concrete evidence\" interference had taken place, but he wasn't \"naive\" to the fact that it could happen at some point ahead of that country's March 15 election, wherein Rutte is being challenged by Geert Wilders. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the Russian government, among other countries, had \"tried hundreds of times in recent months to penetrate the computers of Dutch government agencies and businesses.\"  Far-right MP Wildersa vehement opponent of Islam and a strong contender to be the Netherlands next prime ministerhas also called for leaving the EU, but he may not be as pro-Putin as Le Pen and Trump. Nevertheless, Dutch officials have said they will count all election ballots by hand due to worries about manipulation of electronic vote counting machines.  Treisman says what happens next in terms of Russia and the European elections is \"all up in the air, in part because we don't know what the US administration is going to end up doing\" with regard to its policy toward Russia.  Trump has repeatedly said that he's hoping for a good working relationship with Putin, but offered mixed and confusing signals during the campaign about what he thought about Putin's actions in the Ukraine and his annexing of Crimea in 2014. During her first full day on the job, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley condemned Russian violence in eastern Ukraine and called for \"an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea.\" Trump has rattled European allies by praising Brexit and calling NATO \"obsolete,\" but members of his cabinet have reaffirmed the US commitment to a strong NATO, which is one of Putin's main points of contention with the west.  While it makes sense to watch all of this and try to discern a pattern in Putin's strategy, Treisman says, \"I don't think he has this clear over-arching agenda, that he's out to expand Russia's borders or achieve anything very concrete. I think he's just looking for ways to resist pressures he sees coming from the west and increase his influence, and his options, and his friends worldwide.\"", "date": "2017/02/27", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/what-russia-european-elections", "title": "Russian Hackers May Now Be Mucking With European Elections"}, {"text": "Earthlings are one step closer to confirming that they're not the only living things in the universe. An international group of scientists announced Wednesday that they've been observing seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a dwarf star named Trappist-1. The discovery, according to the New York Times, is the \"first realistic opportunity to search for biological signs of alien life outside of the solar system.\"  The star is about 235 trillion miles from Earth, or about 40 light years. The planets happen to be oriented in such a way to allow them to be \"studied in great detail,\" the Times notes.  \"This is the first time so many planets of this kind are found around the same star,\" Michael Gillon, an astronomer at the University of Liege in Belgium and the leader of the team of scientists, said Wednesday. Another astronomer from the group, Amy H.M.J.

Sara Seagar, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is not a part of the team that made the discovery, told the Times that these planets make the \"search for life in the galaxy imminent,\" adding that for \"the first time ever, we don't have to speculate. We just have to wait and then make very careful observations and see what is in the atmospheres of the Trappist planets.\"  Of course, there are those who believe that life from other planets not only exists but has visited Earth at some point in the past.

Hillary Clinton's run for the White House will be remembered for many things, but information security isn't likely to be one of them. Her campaign was buffeted by two major hacking episodes. First, the contents of Democratic National Committee servers were stolen and disseminated through WikiLeaks and other news organizations. Then campaign chairman John Podesta had his personal email account hacked and its contents passed to WikiLeaks, which subsequently released the 50,000-email set in chunks over a period of weeks as the presidential election reached fever pitch. The US government's intelligence community went on to assert that the hacks had been orchestrated at the behest of the Russian government as a deliberate attempt to hurt Clinton's chances and boost Donald Trump.  But Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, said this week that the hacks didn't hit the campaign itself, and that's because the campaign conducted regular security training for staffers, including sending them fake phishing emails to see how they'd be handled.  \"We sent out phishing emails of our own to test people and communicate back to team to see how far they were clicking, to educate people, and show their vulnerability and how much their choices matter,\" Mook told Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news website, while attending an information security conference in San Francisco.

There were signs in the bathrooms \"about not sharing passwords and 'Don't clink that link, stop and think,'\" Mook said.  The Dark Reading piece doesn't address when the training took place or whether Podesta and his aides were involved. Podesta and Mook did not respond to requests for comment about the IT training during the campaign.  A phishing attack is an attempt to trick a victim into giving up personal information, including logins for email accounts, bank accounts, and other sensitive information.

According to the New York Times, a campaign IT staffer inadvertently advised Podesta and his aides that the warning was legitimate.

The prosecutor explained that he wouldn't be receiving the video evidence he needed as part of a case involving the Cockrell Hill Police Department, which serves a town of about 4,300 people near Dallas. The reason? \"They got hacked by Russians,\" Beggs tells Mother Jones, \"and they held them up for ransom and took all their stuff. They didn't pay to get it back, so they lost all their videos.'\"  \"My mouth kind of hung open for a split second,\" Beggs says, and then he told the prosecutor, \"You want me to go back to my guy and tell him to plead to 10 years in prison and tell his momma that? And the response to why we don't have any more evidence is Russian hackers? I can't do that.\"  \"Russian hackers\" have become part of the national conversation as a result of their alleged attempts to swing the presidential election, but cybercrime is as old as the internet and law enforcement agencies and other public institutions have not been spared. The Cockrell Hill Police Department is just the latest police department to fall victim to ransomware, an attack in which malicious software is installed on a computer after a link is clicked in an email or an email attachment is opened. Once installed, the software encrypts as many documents and folders as it can. A page will appear informing the victim that their files are locked, and they can only get them back by paying a certain amount of money. Bitcoin, a web-based currency that allows for more anonymity, is often the preferred currency.  It happened to the Tewksbury, Massachusetts, police department in December 2014; the Midlothian Police Department in suburban Chicago in January 2015; the Dickson County, Tennessee, sheriff's department in October 2014; and the Durham, New Hampshire, police department in June 2014. A ransomware attack hit the San Francisco Metropolitan Transit Agency in November 2016 demanding roughly $73,000. A security researcher found that the attacker had \"successfully extorted at least $140,000\" from other organizations, including private companies, according to journalist Brian Krebs, a computer security reporter. Hospitals are perhaps the most frequent victims of ransomware attacks due to the value of medical information, according to some estimates.  Officials from the Cockrell Hill Police Department did not respond to requests for comment, but a statement issued by the department on January 25 reported that a server containing documents, videos, and photos dating back to 2009 was hit by \"OSIRIS,\" a ransomware variant, on December 12. The attackers wanted roughly $4,000 worth of bitcoin to unlock the files. After consulting the FBI and the department's IT staff, and taking into account the possibility that the files might not be unlocked even if the $4,000 were paid, the decision was made to wipe the server and delete all its contents.  The police department claimed that they still had paper copies of all the documents on the server and physical copies of much of the video. But in a letter sent to the county prosecutor, the department said \"all bodycam video, some photos, some in-car video, and some police department surveillance video were lost.\" The department tried to recover as much as possible but said that \"if requests are made for said material and it has been lost, there is no chance of recovery or producing the material.\"  \"[This has] been happening increasingly at law enforcement agencies and other government facilities,\" says Nick Selby, a police detective in the Dallas area and director of the Secure Ideas Response Team, a computer security services organization. \"The reason is that ransomware is sort of like spam_a low-tech approach that capitalizes on human vulnerability.\" Selby says the problem is exacerbated in small and medium police departments, where police chiefs are given relatively small budgets with large responsibilities. \"Every dollar spent on [security training and software security programs] is a dollar you didn't spend on a cop in the street or a new Tahoe or a new jail.\"  These attacks are not necessarily deliberately targeting police departments, Selby and others note. Instead, the computer systems in police departments might be more vulnerable. \"These are automated attacks that are seeking victims to click on something on underprotected networks to propagate,\" Selby says.  Mike Geraghty, director of the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), agrees. There's a difference between phishing, he says, \"where you just cast your line into the ocean and hope to catch a fish,\" or spear phishing, \"where you've got a target in mind and you're going after a target for a particular reason.\" It's hard to know how widely these online scammers cast their net, but \"they may have sent out 100,000 emails and they caught that one fish.\"  \"If you look at what ransomware is about, it's about extorting money by any means,\" he says. \"Maybe the police department is not the one that an extortionist would really go after. There are other low-hanging fruit.\"  Geraghty, whose organization is a division of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, says police departments may not be specifically targeted, but the loss of evidence is a major problem. Any break in the chain of evidence is going to cast doubt on the integrity of whatever remaining evidence may be introduced in court.

Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the committee chairman, requesting that he either initiate a full investigation of Michael FlynnPresident Donald Trump's national security adviser who was caught misrepresenting conversations he had with the Russian ambassadoror \"step aside and allow the Committee to vote on conducting basic oversight going forward.\"  Flynn has been under fire since the Washington Post reported last week that he had discussed \"US sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office,\" despite claims to the contrary from Trump administration officials, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn, too, had previously denied discussing with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislya the sanctions levied by President Barack Obama in response to Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election during a series of conversations in late December. But a spokesman for Flynn told the Post on Thursday that \"he couldn't be certain that [sanctions] never came up.\"  On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said Flynn \"does enjoy the full confidence of the president.\" Less than an hour later, Spicer issued a statement saying that Trump was \"evaluating the situation.\" Monday night, the Post reported that then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House in late January that she believed \"Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador.\" The paper noted that she had \"warned that [Flynn] was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail.\"  The House Democrats' letter to Chaffetz notes that Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, has repeatedly asked Chaffetz to investigate Flynn's contacts with the Russian government and put forward the case for an investigation:  Grave questions have been raised about the fitness of General Flynn to serve as National Security Adviser and to continue having access to classified information. It has now been reported that General Flynn took payments of an undisclosed amount to travel to Moscow to dine with Vladimir Putin and celebrate RT, which US intelligence officials warn is the \"Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet\"; that he potentially failed to obtain the consent of Congress to receive those funds in violation of the Constitution; that he communicated repeatedly with Russian officials while that nation was engaged in an attack on our democracy and our presidential election; that he secretly discussed with the Russian ambassador, in possible violation of the Logan Act, sanctions imposed by President Obama in response to these Russian attacks; and that he may have lied about these discussions not only to the American people, but to his own White House colleagues, including the Vice President. [_] If you are not willing to initiate this investigation_then we ask that you not prevent us from calling up this matter at the next business meeting so we may request a vote on this and other proposals going forward on this matter.  Chaffetz, who was eager to investigate Hillary Clinton's email controversy, has come under pressure from Democrats on the committee and his own constituents for going soft on Trump and not launching inquiries regarding Trump's financial conflicts of interest.

According to a report Thursday from Reuters, when Russian President Vladimir Putin brought up the 2010 New START treaty on a recent call with Trump, the American president had to ask his aides what the treaty was. He then expressed doubts to Putin about extending the treaty, according to the report, and called it a bad deal.  \"The Reuters report...suggests that he's extremely ill-informed about the most serious foreign policy, national security issues a president needs to know,\" says Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organization focused on arms control policy. \"His cluelessness is dangerous in the sense that if he doesn't understand the risks of nuclear weapons and commonsense measures to reduce the risks, he is, and the nation is, vulnerable to missteps.\"  According to Reuters, during Trump's first call with Putin as president on January 28, Trump denounced New START as a bad deal for the United States and had to \"ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was.\" The White House didn't comment for the story and referred Reuters to the public readout of the call, which makes no mention of discussions about nuclear weapons policy. White House press secretary Sean Spicer wouldn't comment on the story during Thursday's public press briefing and said the readout was the only resource the administration would make available.  The treaty, negotiated by President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, was ratified by the US Senate by a vote of 71 to 26. Kimball says that's because it was seen as a key step toward reducing both nations' deployed nuclear stockpiles and included monitoring of both sides. \"So in a time of tension with Russia,\" he says, \"this provides transparency and predictability, and it means that neither side can vastly increase their nuclear arsenals, which were already far larger than any reasonable measure would suggest they need to be.\"  Kimball adds that the opposition to the treaty when it was signed in 2010 seemed to revolve around the perception that the deal allowed Russia to deploy nuclear weapons at a greater rate than the United States and wouldn't allow the United States to modernize its nuclear arsenal. He points out that a Pentagon review of the US nuclear arsenal found that the country could further reduce its stockpile by up to one-third without affecting US nuclear capability, so the idea that nuclear capability is somehow hampered by New START is not accurate.  Joe Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a nuclear arms reduction advocacy organization, says in an email that Trump's opposition to the deal seems to be political and could ultimately damage US national interests.  \"The treaty had the overwhelming support of America's military, intelligence, and national security leaders,\" Cirincione says. \"The fact that Donald Trump seems to be taking his nuclear policy advice from far-right ideologues who opposed the pact should be deeply troubling to every citizen...He seems unable to set aside his peculiar personal prejudices from his own strategic goal of improving relations with Russia. He is tripping up his own agenda.\"  Kimball says the Reuters report suggests that Trump is not prepared to handle the complexities of nuclear policy. \"This is the guy who now has a military officer shadowing him everywhere he goes,\" he says, \"carrying a 45-pound black briefcase that can be used by the president to transmit the launch codes to strategic command in Omaha to launch as many as 900 nuclear warheads in under 10 minutes, and no one has to agree with Mr. Trump about doing that. He has an incredibly awesome, almost sole authority to launch these weapons. He holds the fate of the planet in his hands, or in the briefcase that follows him everywhere, and this report today, it's incredibly disturbing because it suggests that he is clueless about this important nuclear risk reduction agreement and does not have a clear strategy for further reduce risks with Russia and other countries.\"  He also said that any attempts to brush this report off as just another odd statement out of the White House would be missing the bigger picture.  \"This is not a 6 a.m. tweet in response to a cable news show,\" Kimball says. \"This is a complex conversation with the president of Russia, and he's speaking about an extremely important treaty governing US and Russian nuclear forces.

On Wednesday, one of Trump's favorite military minds appeared to add his voice to the public condemnation.  General David Petraeus, a finalist for secretary of state in the Trump administration despite his disgraced exit from the CIA, told the House Armed Services Committee that broad-brush statements from Trump and others in his administration about Islam and Muslims complicate the fight against groups like ISIS.  \"We must also remember that Islamic extremists want to portray this fight as a clash of civilizations, with America at war against Islam,\" Petraeus said at a hearing on national security threats and challenges. \"We must not let them do that. Indeed, we must be very sensitive to actions that might give them ammunition in such an effort.\"  Trump's executive order grew out of his campaign promise to implement a \"Muslim ban.\" It followed reports that the Trump administration was considering reopening CIA black sites, based on a draft executive order that replaced phrases like \"global war on terrorism\" and \"jihadist\" with \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and \"Islamist.\" This weekend, Trump also elevated adviser Steve Bannon by giving him a seat on the National Security Council's Principals Committee. Bannon has said that Islam is a \"religion of submission\" and frequently hosted and praised guests on his radio show who disparaged Islam.  At Wednesday's hearing, Petraeus also pushed back on Trump's suggestions that NATO alliances might be weakened and Russian aggression tolerated. Trump has called NATO \"obsolete\" and has worried leaders across the world with his seemingly soft stance on Russia.  \"Americans should not take the current international order for granted,\" the retired general said. \"It did not will itself into existence. We created it. Likewise, it is not naturally self-sustaining. We have sustained it. If we stop doing so it will fray and eventually collapse. This is precisely what some of our adversaries seek to encourage.  Petraeus told the committee that \"conventional aggression\" may get US adversaries like Russia \"a bit of land on its periphery,\" but the real fight is more fundamental. \"The real center of gravity is the political will of the major democratic powers to defend Euro-Atlantic institutions like NATO and the [European Union],\" Petraeus said. \"That is why Russia is working tenaciously to sow doubt in the legitimacy of these institutions and our entire democratic way of life.\"", "date": "2017/02/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/david-petraeus-drops-truth-bomb-trump-administration", "title": "Petraeus Warns That Divisive Actions on Muslims Strengthen Extremists"}, {"text": "On January 12, WikiLeaks tweeted that founder Julian Assange, holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, would \"agree to US extradition\" if President Barack Obama granted clemency to convicted Army leaker Chelsea Manning. Five days later, Obama commuted Manning's sentence, and the spotlight turned to Assange. The embattled Australian said that although he'd hoped for a full pardon for Manning, he would stand by his pledge and discuss a return to the United States with the Department of Justice.  But the situation isn't that simple, says Barry Pollack, Assange's Washington, DC-based lawyer. Assange, Pollack says, is stuck in limbo because the Justice Department won't make clear what it's intentions arewhether it will charge him, whether he's already been indicted, or whether there's room to talk about a resolution.  \"I have, for quite some period of time, been trying to get the Department of Justice to engage in some sort of a dialogue about what it is they are looking for,\" Pollack tells Mother Jones. \"Where does Julian fit into whatever investigation they're doing? Have they charged him? Will they charge him? Are they seeking to extradite him? And the Department of Justice has just repeatedly refused to engage or provide any information whatsoever.\"  Assange has been a thorn in the side of the US government for years, but his decision last year to publish tens of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails and documents, allegedly stolen at the behest of the Russian government and passed to WikiLeaks, further inflamed tensions. On January 6, intelligence officials released an assessment accusing Russian intelligence of directing the hacks in order to hinder Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming president and boost those of Donald Trump.  Assange has denied that the Russian government was his source and said the January 6 report was \"embarrassing\" to the agencies that gathered the intelligence and a \"political attack cannon against Donald Trump.\" Assange denies that he supports Trump: Last July, he likened the choice between Clinton and Trump to one between \"cholera or gonorrhea.\" But he has drawn praise from Trump and conservatives, with some arguing that Trump should pardon Assange on any potential charges.  So when Assange offered to give himself up to US authorities in exchange for Manning's release and Obama commuted Manning's sentence, eyes turned to Assange to see what he'd do next. Two weeks later, that hasn't become any clearer.  \"We look forward to having a conversation with the DOJ about what the correct way forward is,\" Assange said during a January 19 press conference. \"We say, of course, that they should immediately drop their case, or they should unseal their extradition request if they have one, unseal their charges_But what is occurring in the United States is an attempt to prevent us and our lawyers getting our teeth stuck in to this case and getting standing by keeping it secret.\"  Pollack, who represents Assange in his US legal matters and has nothing to do with WikiLeaks, says there is no basis for anyone to make predictions about how Trump might handle the Assange and WikiLeaks investigation. But he points to Obama's commutation of Manning's sentence and his pardon of General James Cartwright, who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators in 2016 about providing information about the Stuxnet computer virus to reporters, as evidence that the crackdown on whistleblowers might be ebbing.  \"My hope,\" he says, \"would have been and is that the commutation of Manning's sentenceand, for that matter, the pardon of Cartwrightsignals that we're moving into a new phase_that maybe there's some thought somewhere in the US government that our war on whistleblowers has gone a little bit too far.\"  The Justice Department has been investigating potential crimes committed by WikiLeaks and Assange since 2010, after the site that year published a video shot in 2007 from a US military helicopter as it gunned down a dozen people in a Baghdad neighborhood. (A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the department's investigation, and the White House didn't respond to several requests for comment.) A month later, Manning, then an Army information analyst stationed in Baghdad, was detained by the military after being turned in by a former hacker she'd confided in about stealing the material published by WikiLeaks.  In November 2010, the website began publishing information from more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables in conjunction with several major newspapers. In September 2011, the site released the full unredacted batch of State Department cables after the material became available online through other means. Manning was formally charged with crimes related to stealing the documents in February 2012, convicted in July 2013, and sentenced to 35 years in prison in August 2013.  After the commutation was announced, Obama said that justice had been served. \"First of all, let's be clear,\" Obama said at his last press conference as president. \"Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence.\" He noted that Manning's sentence was \"very disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received\" and that \"it made some sense to commute a part of her sentence.\"  Assange was accused of rape in Sweden in August 2010, a charge he denies. At the time, he implied that the accusations were \"dirty tricks\" by US intelligence to discredit WikiLeaks. \"Reminder: US intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks as far back as 2008,\" Assange tweeted after the accusations became public. Fearing that the Swedish government would send him to the United States, Assange sought asylum in Ecuador. The country granted it in August 2012, citing the possibility that he could be the victim of \"cruel and degrading\" treatment in the United States.  Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London ever since, and the British government says it will not allow him to leave the embassy and plans to hand him over to Sweden as part of its obligation to respect a European arrest warrant. The United Nations Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called the situation \"a state of arbitrary deprivation of liberty\" and noted that under current British lawwhich was changed to raise the bar for extraditions after Sweden issued its warrantAssange's extradition to Sweden would not be approved by the British government.  Sweden has said it hasn't received an extradition request from the US government, and it's unclear whether the United States is trying to extradite him. \"We don't know,\" Pollack says. Assuming the United States does want to get its hands on Assange, it's unclear what charges he would face.  Assange asserts that WikiLeaks is merely publishing information it obtains, much as news organizations do every day. But the government might make the case that Assange went beyond merely accepting material from Manning, perhaps alleging some sort of collusion or coercion to steal the material. Pollack says allegations along those lines wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility given the Obama administration's naming of journalists as \"unindicted co-conspirators\" in cases involving leaks of classified information.  \"I think that the problem they have is they really can't distinguish [Assange] from the New York Times or the Washington Post or Mother Jones,\" Pollack says, and \"they may recognize that legally they would have real problem doing so.\"  It's unclear how far along the government's investigation is. Pollack says he has no idea and noted in an August 2016 letter to then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the limited information he gets about the investigation comes through filings in other cases. Assange said during the January 19 press conference, based on responses to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the government by other parties, that the FBI investigation alone has produced at least 45,135 pages of documents. Hacked emails from the private intelligence firm Stratfor, published by WikiLeaks in 2012, suggested the US government had a sealed indictment in early 2011, but in 2013, unnamed officials told the Washington Post that there was no sealed indictment.  \"It really is unique in my experience,\" says Pollack, who has worked in federal criminal defense for 25 years. \"I've never had a matter where the Department of Justice would not discuss my client's situation with me, much less one where simultaneously they're providing the public with at least some information.\"  But Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer in Washington, says it doesn't seem unusual to him.  \"In a situation where there is a sealed indictment, the DOJ is not obligated to reveal details of pending charges to the subject or his lawyer until the subject is actually arrested,\" Moss says. \"To hold otherwise would nullify the purpose of the seal.\"  Both Pollack and Assange seem to want the case to move forward. Pollack says the Justice Department could resolve the situation by declaring that there's no indictment or by telling him what exactly investigators are seeking from Assange.  \"Maybe it's that they're perfectly happy to leave him in limbo in the embassy,\" Pollack says. \"But that, to me, is not justice_What they should do is they should engage and say either we're not pursuing him or we are. And if they're not, great. And if they are, let's discuss what that means.\"", "date": "2017/02/01", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/julian-assange-chelsea-manning-extradition-trump", "title": "Assange Lawyer to Justice Department: Your Move"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump signs an executive order concerning oil pipelines on Tuesday.  President Donald Trump is considering reopening the notorious CIA \"black site\" prisons, undoing the ban imposed by President Barack Obama, after his new CIA director suggested he'd be open to using torture methods on detainees.  The administration's plans were reported by the New York Times on Wednesday after the paper obtained a draft executive order titled \"Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants.\" The order would roll back many of the restrictions on detainee interrogations and detention that Obama put in place, including one that gave the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees in US custody. But in his daily press briefing on Wednesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the draft was \"not a White House document.\"  The CIA's black sites were a series of facilities located in various countries around the world where the CIA detained, questioned, and often tortured detainees with practices including waterboarding, confinement in small boxes, beatings, and extreme sleep deprivation. They were exposed in 2005 by the Washington Post's Dana Priest.  The draft doesn't direct the CIA to reopen the sites immediately, but it requests policy reviews to make recommendations to Trump. As the Times' Charlie Savage notes, Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to reinstate waterboarding and a \"hell of a lot worse\" and said that even if torture tactics didn't work, the detainees \"deserve it anyway.\"  Throughout the draft, phrases such as \"jihadist\" and \"global war on terrorism\" are crossed out and replaced with \"Islamist,\" \"radical Islamist terrorism,\" and similar phrases.  Shortly after news of the order broke, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) released a statement condemning the use of torture. \"The President can sign whatever executive orders he likes,\" McCain said. \"But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.\"  The draft order comes five days after Mike Pompeo, since confirmed as CIA director, suggested he was open to torture techniques. In written answers to the Senate Intelligence Committee after his January 12 confirmation hearing, Pompeo seemed to leave the door open for a review of the ban on torture methods such as waterboarding. During his hearing, Pompeo had given a seemingly contradictory answer, saying he would \"absolutely not\" restart the CIA's use of such techniques and adding that he couldn't \"imagine [he] would be asked by the president-elect or then-president\" to have the CIA torture someone.  The full three-page draft, posted in full by the Washington Post later Wednesday morning (and later by the Times), lays out the rationale for the review:  Our Nation remains engaged in a global armed conflict with ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other associated international jihadist Islamist terrorist groups. This conflict is not of our choosing, but was declared against us by the jihadist terrorist organizations groups that have plotted and carried out mass attacks against the United States, its citizens, and its allies beginning well before the atrocities of September 11, 2001, and continuing to this day_Experience has also shown that obtaining critical intelligence information is vital to taking determined offensive action, including military action, against those groups that make war on us and that are actively plotting further attacks. While there have been continuity in many of the military and intelligence policies of the United States in the global war on terrorism, fight against radical Islam, the United States has refrained from exercising certain authorities critical to its defense.  The draft, which contains extensive editing notes, would rescind two of Obama's executive orders: one to close the military prison at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, and the other to give the Red Cross access to all detainees. It also orders the director of national intelligence, the attorney general, and the director of the CIA to \"recommend to the President whether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States and whether such program should include the use of detention facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\"  This story has been updated to include the statement from McCain and the comment from Spicer.", "date": "2017/01/25", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/reports-trump-administration-exploring-re-opening-cia-black-sites", "title": "Trump Is Reportedly Considering Reopening CIA \"Black Site\" Prisons"}, {"text": "The Senate is set to confirm as the new head of the CIA on Monday a man who is open to revisiting the practice of waterboardingeven if that's not what he told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing.  Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), President Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's top spy agency, appeared before the committee on January 12 for a televised hearing. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked Pompeo whether he'd restart the \"CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques that fall outside the Army field manual.\" That was a clear reference to waterboarding, a practice considered torture by many international experts.  \"Absolutely not,\" Pompeo responded. He said he would always comply with the law and couldn't \"imagine [he] would be asked by the president-elect or then-president\" to have the CIA torture someone.  But on Friday, the day Trump was assumed the role of president, the intelligence committee released Pompeo's written answers to questions posed by senators after the initial hearing. Feinstein again brought up waterboarding, asking specifically whether Pompeo would commit to \"refraining from taking any steps to authorize or implement any plan that would bring back waterboarding or any other enhanced interrogation [technique].\" Pompeo gave a different answer this time.  \"I will consult with the experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the U.S. government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed,\" Pompeo wrote. \"If any such differences are justified, a fundamental requirement is that such differences fully comply with law, including laws governing the treatment and interrogation of individuals.\"  The written questions also elicited Pompeo's thoughts on the CIA's collection of publicly available information on Americans, a controversial practice given that the CIA is generally a foreign-focused intelligence agency that's supposed to engage in only limited domestic activity. \"I made the statement...in the context of if 'someone's out there on their Facebook page talking about an attack or plotting an attack against America,'\" Pompeo wrote in response to questions from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). \"In such cases, publicly available information can provide relevant information and generally involves fewer privacy concerns than other collection techniques.\"  Pompeo added that \"of course there are boundaries\" to the CIA's collection of such information and that any such activity would be \"conducted in accordance to the Constitution, statutes, and applicable presidential directives.\"  Pompeo's thoughts on this matter were laid out in a January 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which he said that Washington was \"blunting\" the \"surveillance powers\" of the intelligence community by refraining from collecting people's personal information and called for a \"fundamental upgrade to America's surveillance capabilities.\" He said the country should re-establish its bulk metadata collection program and \"[combine] it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.\"  Wyden asked about the database in the written questions. Pompeo responded that he hadn't \"consulted legal experts on a hypothetical database\" or studied which third-party information would be available to include in the database.  On Saturday, Human Rights Watch urged senators to vote against Pompeo's confirmation, citing concerns about his thoughts on torture and surveillance.  \"Pompeo's responses to questions about torture and mass surveillance are dangerously ambiguous about whether he would endorse abusive practices and seek to subvert existing legal protections,\" Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, the group's US program co-director, said in a statement. \"Pompeo's failure to unequivocally disavow torture and mass surveillance, coupled with his record of advocacy for surveillance of Americans and past endorsement of the shuttered CIA torture program, make clear that he should not be running the CIA.\"", "date": "2017/01/23", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-cia-pick-mike-pompeo-waterboarding", "title": "Trump's CIA Pick Said He Was Against Waterboarding.

She said in February 2016 that Trump was \"everything a governor doesn't want in a president,\" and only tepidly supported him after first backing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and then Sen.

The notoriously thin-skinned Trump responded by calling the Indian American governor \"very weak on illegal immigration,\" and by tweeting, \"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" Nonetheless, as president-elect, Trump picked Haley to be his ambassador to the United Nations, calling her a \"proven deal-maker\" with \"a track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation.\" Haley accepted his nomination: \"Our country faces enormous challenges here at home and internationally,\" she said, adding that she was \"honored that the president-elect has asked me to join his team.\"  But during her Senate Foreign Relations committee confirmation hearings Wednesday, flanked by her husband, son, parents, and two brothers, Haley joined other Cabinet nominees in expressing differences with Trump on foreign policy issues, starting with Russia.  \"Do you agree, that both at the UN in New York and on the streets of Aleppo, Moscow has acted as an active accomplice in Assad's murder of his own people?\" Sen.

Tom Udall (D-N.M.), said it was very clear that Russia had interfered in the US presidential election and asked Haley whether she would \"stand up to Vladimir Putin and against Russia's attempt to interfere with our electoral system?\"  \"We should stand up to any country that attempts to interfere with our [election] system,\" Haley said. Udall then asked her what her message to her Russian counterpart at the UN would be regarding election meddling.  \"That we are aware that it has happened, we don't find it acceptable, and that we are going to fight back every time we see something like that happening,\" Haley replied. \"I don't think Russia's going to be the only oneI think we're going to start to see this around the world with other countries. And I think that we need to take a firm stand that when we see that happen, we are not going to take that softly, we are going to be very hard on that.\"  Trump has continually downplayed and cast doubt on the findings of the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the FBI that Russia's government attempted to influence the 2016 US presidential election in order to hurt Hillary Clinton and boost Trump's chances of winning. Haley was just the latest of his nominees to publicly break from the president-elect on Russia: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson did, and so did Defense Secretary nominee General James Mattis and the nominee for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo.  Haley also came out in support of NATO, calling it \"an important alliance for us to have_and I think it's [an alliance] we need to strengthen.\" Trump has called NATO \"obsolete.\"  Unlike the confirmation hearings for some of Trump's other Cabinet picks, there were no contentious exchanges with even the Democratic senators during her three-and-a-half-hour hearing.

In May 2014, Mother Jones' Shane Bauer wrote about L_pez Rivera's case:  In 1981, L_pez was charged with armed robbery, possession of an unregistered firearm, and interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, allegedly as part of a larger plot to challenge the United States' role in Puerto Rico by force. The court determined that he was connected to the FALN. At his trial, one man testified that L_pez taught him bomb-making skills.  In all, the FALN claimed responsibility for more than 120 bombings across the US between 1974 and 1983, leading to the death of six and the injury of dozens. But the basis for L_pez's conviction was specifically the more than two-dozen bombings claimed by the organization in the Chicago area, none of which resulted in injuries. A 1980 Chicago Tribune editorial observed that the bombs were \"placed and timed as to damage property rather than persons\" and that the FALN was \"out to call attention to their cause rather than to shed blood.\" At least 16 other Puerto Rican nationalists were charged with seditious conspiracy and related offenses in the early 1980s. None were ultimately found to have connections to actual attacks, yet at the sentencing hearing, the judge said he regretted not being able to issue the death penalty. He handed out sentences up to 90 years, with L_pez Rivera receiving 55 years. By contrast, the average sentence for homicide in 1992 (the closest year for which data is available) was less than 12.5 years. During his 33 years in prison, L_pez Rivera has served 12 years in solitary confinement in some of the highest security prisons in the country. His lawyer, Jan Susler, says he hasn't been allowed to do an in-person media interview for 15 years. Nonmedia visits are restricted as well, she says. A delegation that included a New York senator, a New York assemblyman, and New York City Council members were denied authorization to visit him in prison.  Former President Bill Clinton offered L_pez Rivera clemency in 1999 \"against the protests of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the US attorney's office, and even his wife,\" Bauer wrote. Instead of leaving prison, L_pez Rivera chose to remain incarcerated until his codefendant, Carlos Alberto Torres, was released. (Torres was granted parole in 2010.) L_pez Rivera, who is now 74, will be released from a federal prison on May 17.  He was one of 209 people who had their sentences commuted by Obama just three days before Obama leaves office. Perhaps the highest-profile case was Chelsea Manning, the former Army private accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of US government files to WikiLeaks in 2010.

Which made it all the more striking when a Trump Cabinet nominee got a friendlyand even laudatoryreception from the minority party in the Senate when he appeared for a confirmation hearing on Thursday. Retired Gen. James Mattis, up for secretary of defense, requires a congressional waiver to join the Cabinet because he's been out of the military for fewer than seven years. But Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee appeared eager to grant him that waiver, in part because they see Mattis, nicknamed \"Mad Dog,\" as a moderating force on Trump's far-right inner circle.  Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the committee, told the retired Marine Corps general that \"many have supported the waiver legislation in your confirmation because they believe you will be, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, 'the saucer that cools the coffee.'\"  Even Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who voted against the waiver, told Mattis, \"If there were ever a case for a waiver of that principle, it is you, in this moment in our history. I believe that your appreciation for the costs of war in blood, treasure, and lives and the impact on veterans afterward will enable you to be a check on rash and potentially ill-considered use of military force by a president-elect who perhaps lacks that same appreciation.\"  Mattis' thoughts on Russia and NATO helped keep his three-hour confirmation hearing relatively conflict-free, unlike those earlier this week for attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson. Trump has been liberal in his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called NATOthe military alliance formed in response to threats from the Soviet Union\"obsolete.\" Mattis called NATO \"the most successful military alliance in modern world history, maybe ever,\" and he was willing to castigate Putin and discuss Russian threats to US interests. \"The most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with with Mr. Putin,\" he told the committee, \"and we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and that we take the integrated stepsdiplomatic, economic, military, and the alliance stepsto defend ourselves where we must.\"  Mattis said he agrees with Trump that the United States should engage Russia and identify areas of cooperation, but that we have to be realistic. \"Russia has chosen to be a strategic competitor,\" said Mattis, who was removed from his military post in 2013 after the Obama administration felt he was too hawkish on Iran. \"They're an adversary in key areas. I'm all for engagement, but we also have to recognize reality and what Russia is up to. And there's decreasing areas where we can engage cooperatively and increasing areas where we're going to have to confront Russia.\"  He added, \"I would not have taken this job if I didn't believe the president-elect was open to my advice on this or any other matter.\"  Advocates of women in the military have expressed concern that Mattis could roll back rules allowing women to serve in combat roles. Mattis co-edited the 2016 book Warriors & Citizens: American Views of Our Military, in which he wrote that \"an uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military.\" But on Thursday, he said, \"I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military,\" and he later added that he had no issues with gays serving openly.  \"Frankly, senator,\" he said, \"I've never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with.\"", "date": "2017/01/12", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-secretary-defense-james-mad-dog-mattis-democrats", "title": "Democrats Hope \"Mad Dog\" Will Calm Trump Down"}, {"text": "In his first press conference in half a year, Donald Trump came close to acknowledging the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia had meddled in the election to benefit him, saying, \"I think it was Russia.\" But he quickly added that others are always trying to hack US targets and downplayed the Russian hack, asking why it received so much more attention than a Chinese cyber-attack on the US government several years ago. And when Trump was given a chance to rebut claims that his campaign team had been in communication with Russian intermediaries during the campaign, he did not deny those allegations.  At the end of the nearly hour-long press conference, Trump ignored a question from a reporter about contacts between people associated with him and Russians. The reporter asked, \"Can you stand here today, once and for all, and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign? And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now?\"  But Trump chose only to answer the second part of the journalist's query. \"Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading it than when other people have led it,\" he said. \"You will see that. Russia will respect our country. He shouldn't have done it, I don't believe he'll be doing it more now, we have to work something out.

After CNN's story went live, BuzzFeed published a raw \"dossier\" of information used for that briefing, prompting a furious response from Trump during his press conference.  Both stories came months after Mother Jones first reported that a former spy working for a Western country had sent the FBI memos containing the Russian allegations.", "date": "2017/01/11", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-ignores-question-about-contact-russia-during-campaign", "title": "Trump Doesn't Deny Contact Between His Team and Russia During Campaign"}, {"text": "America's top intelligence officials have briefed President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump on allegations that Russian operatives \"claim to have compromising personal and financial information\" about Trump, CNN reported Tuesday evening. According to the network, these allegations were included in a two-page memo that was appended to the intelligence community's assessment that concluded that Russia had hacked political targets during the US presidential election in order to benefit Donald Trump. From CNN:  The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.  The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.  In late October, Mother Jones' David Corn first reported that a former Western counterintelligence official with nearly two decades of experience on \"Russian intelligence matters\" had been assigned the task of looking into Trump's dealings with Russia as part of an opposition research effort initially funded by a Republican donor. This official was so alarmed by what he discovered that he passed the intelligence to the FBI. As Corn reported:  \"It started off as a fairly general inquiry,\" says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, \"there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.\" This was, the former spy remarks, \"an extraordinary situation.\" He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiativewithout the permission of the US company that hired himhe sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified. (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was \"sufficiently serious\" to share with the FBI. Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer's conversations with Russian sources, noted, \"Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.\" It maintained that Trump \"and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.\" It claimed that Russian intelligence had \"compromised\" Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \"blackmail him.\" It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on \"bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.\"  In Mother Jones' original report, we did not publish the memos drafted by the intelligence official or cite specific details from the documents because the allegations could not be confirmed. After the CNN report was published, at least one other news outlet posted the memos.  Trump has yet to respond to the CNN report.

The story was \"inaccurate,\" an official with the Department of Energy, which oversees the NNSA, subsequently told Mother Jones. \"There have been no discussions between the president-elect's transition team and any of NNSA's political appointees on extending their public service past January 20.\" That is, the Trump team didn't exactly send the two officialsretired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank G. Klotz and his deputy, Madelyn Creedonpacking; it just had not held any talks about keeping them on after President Barack Obama's term expires, and their appointments will automatically end. So the end result is the same: By the end of next week, the government division that oversees the nation's nuclear weapons could lack its senior leadershipa prospect that concerns some nuclear experts.  \"You won't have senior-level oversight,\" says Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, an organization focused on nuclear weapons security. \"You won't have somebody actually running the department. You can do that for a little while, but if this goes on for any extended period of time, bad things are going to happen.\"  The Trump transition team and Hope Hicks, Trump's campaign spokeswoman, did not respond to requests for comment.  Cirincione says the NNSA, with a $12 billion annual budget, oversees not only the nation's nuclear stockpile but the contractors involved in maintaining it and its supporting infrastructure. And while the day-to-day mission of the agency will go on, strategic decisions and other senior-level responsibilities will fall by the wayside.  Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonprofit dedicated to better control of nuclear, chemical, biological, and conventional weapons, says it's normal for political appointees to be out the door at the end of the administration that appointed them. But the NNSA head, even if a political appointee, typically stays put until a successor is in place, according to Defense News.  \"It does begin to affect the government if it goes on for a while,\" Kimball says. \"It's not a crisis if it's the situation for a couple months.\"  Rebecca Friedman Lissner, a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says context is important. Broadly speaking, \"very few sub-cabinet officials have been named,\" she says, so it's \"not particularly surprising that we don't yet know who would be taking over NNSA.\" But the NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency with a \"tradition of professionalism and bipartisanship such that there has been continuity in terms of people who have stayed over.\"  As reported by Defense News, NNSA heads have sometimes stayed years into subsequent administrations. It happened with John Gordon, who was appointed by Bill Clinton and stayed two years into the first George W. Bush administration, and with Tom D'Agostino, who was appointed by George W. Bush and served six years into the Obama administration.  Lissner says that a gap in agency leadership will have to be judged in terms of whether Trump plans a major shakeup of nuclear policy, which would require more detailed reviews by the relevant officials. If not, filling the role is less urgent, she says.  \"Either way, the NNSA mission is a vital mission,\" she says. \"It's a no-fail mission, [and] they manage an incredibly challenging and important and often overlooked portfolio.\"", "date": "2017/01/10", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-decapitating-national-nuclear-security-administration", "title": "Trump Is Leaving the Nuclear Oversight Agency With No One in Charge"}, {"text": "During a live press conference broadcast from the Ecuadorian embassy in London via Twitter's livestream app Persicope, WikiLeaks' Julian Assange on Monday blasted the recent US intelligence report on Russian hacking during the 2016 election.  \"It is, frankly, quite embarrassing to the reputation of the US intelligence services to be putting out something that claims to be a report like that,\" Assange said. \"This is a press release. It is clearly designed for political effect and US intelligence have been politicized by the Obama administration in the production of this report and a number of other statements.\"  Assange called the report a \"political attack cannon against Donald Trump\" and a way \"to defend the reason why the Democratic Party lost.\" And he claimed that its true purpose was to bolster certain officials within the Democratic Party and \"delegitimize the election of Donald Trump.\"  Assange's press conference comes three days after the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report outlining its assessment of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign via hacks of US political targets, including the Democratic National Committee and the personal email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. The materials were stolen from those organizations by Russian intelligence, according to the report, and then passed to WikiLeaks, but it does not specify whether this occurred through an intermediary. An online persona known as \"Guccifer 2.0\" claimed credit for the DNC hack and for passing the information along to WikiLeaks and also for providing the material to media outlets and reporters.  \"Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity,\" the declassified report stated, adding that the material published by WikiLeaks did \"not contain any evident forgeries.\" The report stated that Russian intelligence fed the materials to WikiLeaks but didn't say how, or whether it was through a third-party. The Washington Post reported Thursday night that US intelligence had identified the \"actors\" involved in getting the materials to WikiLeaks.  Assange has consistently denied that the materials came from the Russian government and addressed the issue again on Monday.  \"We haven't said we know or don't know our sources,\" he said. \"We have made one statement, which is that our sources in the US election-related matter are not a state party.\" Assange noted the \"incredible care\" with which WikiLeaks speaks about its sources, but this case \"does not sufficiently threaten our sources to make this very bland disclosure.\" With a \"state\" source, however, \"we would have a lot less concern in attempting to protect them.\"  Assange's explanation seems to leave the door open that an intermediary passed the material from Russian intelligence to WikiLeaks.  Assange also discussed the penchant for outgoing administrations to destroy information on the way out the door and said WikiLeaks' recent offer of $30,000 for information that leads to \"the arrest or exposure of Obama admin [sic] officials destroying info [sic],\" is an effort to preserve information that belongs to the public. He implored government employees with access to data to grab it (not mentioning that doing so is a serious crime).  \"Our request to system administrators in the Obama administration, and this goes for other administrations around the world, is take the data,\" he said. \"Just take it now, keep it under your bed, or with your mother, and then you can give that to WikiLeaks or other journalists at your leisure. Get a hold of that history and protect it because that is something that belongs to humanity and does not belong to a political party.\"  Assange blasted President Obama for his administration's treatment of whistleblowers but said that things weren't likely to improve under a President Trump.  \"While there are some anti-DC elements in the Trump cabinet and a lot in his base, very quickly, based on the history of all previous administrations, the Donald Trump administration will form its own establishment and enter into a power-sharing relationship with the existing powers in DC,\" Assange said. \"No system of authority likes those who undermine its authority.\"", "date": "2017/01/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/julian-assange-blasts-us-intel-report-russian-hacking", "title": "Surprise!

But it's still unclear whether Trump believes what he was apparently toldor what it would take to convince him to accept the government's findings that Moscow hacked Democratic targets to help Trump win the election.  After the briefing, Trump issued a statement noting that \"Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee.\" But he did not say he accepts the US intelligence community's conclusion that Moscow did so during the 2016 campaign and was behind the leaking of Democratic emails through WikiLeaks and other sites. Trump did insist that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" Given that Trump repeatedly cited the WikiLeaks material during the campaign, his claim that Russian hacking had no effect on the election is hard to prove.  The meeting comes a day after several top intelligence officials briefed a Senate committee on the matter. Hours after the Senate hearing, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence officials claim to have identified people who passed stolen Democratic emails and other materials to WikiLeaks and that intercepted communications between senior Russian government officials revealed Vladimir Putin's regime had celebrated Trump's victory. Several other media outlets later confirmed the Post's account.  Trump tweeted that reporters were given access to the materials because of \"Politics!\" and later questioned how the government could be confident in its conclusions, pointing to a report that the Democratic National Committee blocked or delayed access to its servers, according to the FBI. (The DNC and others noted that it was not necessary or customary for FBI investigators to access the servers in order to investigate the hack.)

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017  On Friday morning, before his briefing, Trump told the New York Times that the intense focus on Russian hacking is \"a political witch hunt\" led by people embarrassed that Trump won in November.  \"Making this about the election and not the subversion of a foreign government is beyond disturbing,\" a former CIA official tells Mother Jones. \"This isn't about politics; it's about espionage. He needs to get his head wrapped around the fact that he will be the target the moment he steps into office as POTUS.\"  The Trump transition team and Hope Hicks, his campaign spokeswoman, did not respond to a request for comment. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has complained this week that reporters have gone too far in declaring Russia the culprit.  But security researchers say there is plenty of information in the public domain to conclude that the Russian government was involved in the hacks. That involvement was first reported by the Washington Post in June and has since been bolstered by several formal government announcements. The most recent government report, issued jointly by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on December 29, offered a basic outline of the US government's conclusions and explained some of the technical evidence that led the US intelligence community to pin the blame on Russia.  \"The evidence is airtight,\" says Dave Aitel, a former NSA research scientist who now runs a security research firm. \"I don't know anyone in the industry that takes [the doubts] seriously. Within the industry, it's not a question.\"  Matt Tait, a security researcher and former information security specialist for the Government Communications Headquarters, the United Kingdom's version of the National Security Agency, said the information that's been presented so far by the US government and private security research firms who have investigated the hacks supports the case against the Russians.  \"The public evidence for this hack is unusual in how compelling it is compared with almost all other breaches, and that to people who are motivated and technical enough to go through it properly, it provides a solid case even without access to the secret sources and methods used by the U.S. Intelligence Community,\" Tait writes in an email to Mother Jones.  \"There is additional information that the IC could provide,\" he adds, \"but frankly, for people who are not persuaded by the evidence that is currently public, I suspect there is no quantity of additional evidence that the IC could release that will be persuasive to those people.\"  But Jeffrey Carr, a private information security researcher, believes there needs to be more independent vetting of the intelligence community's conclusions. \"I want to see a chain of verifiable evidence available for peer review that is internally consistent, that is not dependent solely upon technical evidence, and that brings us to reasonable certainty as defined by international law,\" he wrote on Medium this month.  Still, it's not clear that anything would convince Trump to accept Russia's role in the hacks. \"Based on the already overwhelming public evidence, whatshort of a video of Putin himself at the keyboardcould change Trump's mind?\" former NSA lawyer Susan Hennessey tweeted Friday morning. Her next tweet: \"Trump isn't actually interested in being persuaded by evidence.

For the past eight years, Jeanette Vizguerra had shown up for every one of her required check-ins with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Though Vizguerra, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, had been issued a deportation order for two misdemeanors in 2011, ICE officials had previously granted her requests for a stay of removal and allowed her to remain in the country with her four children.  But last week, Vizguerra took a different route. Fearing deportation, she took refuge in the First Unitarian Society in Denver and declared sanctuary. The decision proved prescient: The day of Vizguerra's scheduled check-in, ICE officials told her attorney that Vizguerra's request to remain in the country had been denied.  Because ICE has a longstanding policy to not enter churches and schools, Vizguerra will be shielded from deportation. But that means that shell have to stay in the church indefinitely. \"I did not make this decision lightly,\" Vizguerra said through an interpreter, according to NPR. \"I was thinking about it for weeks. But I think that I made the right decision in coming here.\"  Vizguerra may be one of the first undocumented immigrants to seek this kind of refuge since Donald Trump's election but, for months, churches have been preparing for exactly this possibility. Since the election, faith-based organizers and leaders have ramped up their work as part of the sanctuary church movement, a campaign among organizers and clergy to help undocumented immigrants facing deportation. More than 700 congregations have signed on to a sanctuary pledge, with the number of participating congregations doubling since the election, says Noel Andersen, a national grassroots coordinator at Church World Service, an international faith-based organization. New sanctuary coalitions have popped up in Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.  In many ways, this has all happened before. Churches played a huge role in sheltering Central American migrants in the 1980s, when civil wars brought an influx of border crossings. They reached out to immigrants again in 2007, when workplace raids were a common tactic among ICE officers. During the Central American child migrant surge in 2014, congregations revived the movement, opening up their doors to children and families fleeing violence. Churches were able to offer a safe haven to immigrants facing deportation and, in some cases, help individuals win temporary relief from removal.  Now, organizers say, Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies have spurred leaders to continue that movement and expand it to other communities targeted by the administration, such as Muslim and LGBQT communities. They're also looking toward other types of community organizing, such as rapid-response and know-your-rights trainings.  \"The broader strategy is to shine a light on what ICE is doing.\"  Peter Pedemonti, director of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, has focused his efforts on a \"sanctuary in the streets\" campaign, a rapid-response network of volunteers who are trained to peacefully disrupt ICE raids. In a raid in Philadelphia last week, Pedemonti says 70 people showed up outside an ICE office within 20 minutes of being notified. \"The broader strategy is to shine a light on what ICE is doing,\" he says. \"We want ICE to know that if they come into our neighborhoods and try to drag away our friends and neighbors, we are going to be there to slow it down and disrupt it.\"  In Los Angeles, Guillermo Torres, an organizer with Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice, says that the group's congregations have been working with the National Immigration Law Center to develop rapid-response trainings. They want to train people to film encounters, interview witnesses, and build prayer walls around ICE officers. CLUE is also trying to enlist faith leaders who would be willing to go to detention centers after raids to talk to ICE officers or to serve as a source of spiritual support to detainees.  Torres says he's seen a \"surge\" in clergy leaders expressing interest in the movement, many of whom he'd never met before. \"The darkness that's coming out of the president and his administration has created a lot of pain and sadness in in the faith community,\" says Torres, \"and that pain is compelling leaders to move to a level they've not moved before.\"", "date": "2017/02/21", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sanctuary-church-movement-trump-deportation", "title": "Here Are the Churches Fighting Back Against Trump's Immigration Crackdown"}, {"text": "Attorneys at a makeshift office for volunteer attorneys at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport  On a gloomy afternoon at San Francisco International Airport, a dozen or so men and women assembled by the terminal's Starbucks, waiting for their assignments. Behind them, two people huddled over laptops, flanked by a printer, a whiteboard, and stacks of paperwork. A small cardboard sign, cut from a FedEx box, said \"Lawyer\" in English, Arabic, and Farsi. For weeks, this desk was the headquarters for a temporary legal office that helped travelers affected by President Donald Trump's sweeping executive orders on immigration.  Legal clinics like the one at SFO sprang up in major airports across the country, including in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Staffed entirely by volunteers, they were an early sign of the rapid grassroots organizing taking place among lawyers, civil rights activists, and everyday people in response to the executive orders.  Federal courts have suspended the orders, which banned immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries as well as all refugees from entering the United States. Volunteer lawyers are no longer physically stationed at airportsthey are on call to assist passengers who need help. But as the Trump administration continues to expand the scope of immigration enforcement, the clinics offer an intriguing snapshot of what future rapid-response aid may look like as groups move quickly to help people who may be affected.  Boots on the ground  The airport legal clinics formed hours after Trump signed his January 27 executive order. The order's hasty implementation led to chaos, as Customs and Border Protection officers began detaining travelers who came from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen the first weekend the immigration ban was enforced. It drew harsh criticism from civil rights groups, and thousands of protesters clogged airports.  While state attorneys general and national groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American Civil Liberties Union mounted legal challenges against Trump's executive order in federal courts, the volunteer attorneys in airports focused on providing support to individual travelers. During the first days of the travel ban, large organizations such as the International Refugee Assistance Project and the ACLU organized attorneys at airports. Later, this shifted to local groups.  \"They're the command centers, while we're the boots on the ground,\" said Julia Wilson, the chief executive officer of OneJustice, one of several nonprofits that coordinated volunteers for the clinics in the Bay Area.  In Los Angeles, clinic volunteers have assisted more than 300 passengers, while volunteers at SFO have conducted nearly 100 intake interviews since the executive order was signed, said Wilson. The San Francisco airport numbers are an undercount, she said, since the airport was flooded with protesters during the first days the immigration ban was in place, and volunteers could not track exact numbers.  At SFO's international terminal, Rene Schomp, a petite woman with wavy brown hair, stepped forward and began handing out assignments. Arabic and Farsi speakers would serve as interpreters, standing near the arrival gates with signs offering free legal advice. Two volunteers would track important flights. Attorneys would handle intake forms.  It was 4 p.m. and only a handful of people were in the terminal. Schomp pointed to the gate at her left.  \"It might seem like you're wasting your time, or you might wonder why you decided to come here,\" Schomp said. But as soon as flights landed, passengers would soon be streaming out the gatesand the volunteers must be ready.  Think of yourselves as firefighters, she said. \"Firefighters aren't fighting fires all the time. Sometimes they're just sitting around playing cards,\" she said. \"But they're ready to jump up and take action when the fire actually comes.\"  The volunteers' main goal was to gather and disseminate information, especially about how Customs and Border Protection officers were complying with court orders.  \"We would ask folks, 'Were you asked any religious questions? Were you asked about any political practices'?\" says Junaid Sulahry, one of the volunteer lawyers. \"We were trying to gain a sense of whether people were being pulled into secondary screening based off how they look, or if [CBP officers] were engaging in inappropriate questioning.\"  Sulahry says he spoke to one Iranian national who had been placed in secondary screening for four hours. \"We hesitated to approach her because she was in tears,\" he says.  Attorneys aimed to monitor CBP officers' actions and document anything unusual that happened to passengers. They interviewed passengers who wanted to share their own experience going through customs, as well as passengers who may have witnessed something and wanted to report it. Depending on the case, they provided legal advice or made referrals to civil rights organizations or congressional officials if an incident was particularly severe.  In the first few days of the ban, civil rights groups struggled to get information from CBP officers about who may or may not have been detained or deported.  \"We had no access to our clients,\" says Nicholas Esp_ritu, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. \"It was like a black box.\"  The Department of Homeland Security and the White House have been criticized for the chaotic rollout of the executive order, as well as a lack of transparency surrounding the number of people affected. (White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, as well as Trump, initially said only 109 people were affected by the ban. CBP now says on its website that more than 1,000 people were recommended denial of boarding.)  On February 1, the DHS inspector general announced it would conduct a review of the department's implementation of the executive order \"in response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints.\" The watchdog office would also review whether DHS officials complied with court orders and allegations of misconduct.  \"I was so angry\"  Local community groups such as the Asian Law Caucus say monitoring also helps provide resources for family members who may be targeted by the ban.  \"There's a lot of confusion, anxiety, and fear about what is happening and what will happen to family members abroad,\" says Elica Vafaie, a staff attorney with the Asian Law Caucus. Without lawyers or other volunteers present, families would have little access to information or resources in case something does happen.  Many of the volunteers I met at the clinic had attended protests of the executive order at the airport or had heard of the clinic online and signed up. Negeen Etemad who is from San Diego and was volunteering as a Farsi interpreter, found out about the clinic through Facebook. For her, the work felt personal: Her uncle, a green card holder from Iran, had been detained for 13 hours after the executive order took effect.  \"My family was frantic,\" says Etemad, 26. \"I was physically sick because I was so angry.\"  Cori Van Allen, an accountant based in the Bay Area, told me she heard of the clinic through work and wanted to help in any way she could. \"I'm concerned over how this ban was rolled outit feels unconstitutional, like we're singling out people in a way that just feeds into ISIS propaganda,\" said Van Allen, 47. \"I don't feel like it makes me any safer.\"  As I watched the volunteers work, I could see how organized the clinic was. Volunteers worked in four-hour shifts, staffing the airport from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. At least one attorney would remain on call overnight. Name tags were color-codedorange meant you were an immigration attorney; green was for coordinators. A stack of clear plastic boxes tucked underneath the chairs were crammed with supplies: Post-it notes, Sharpies, Kashi bars, and intake forms. Pizza arrived around mid-afternoon, carried in by a volunteer with a white name tag.  The airport followed a rhythm: quiet at one moment, then bustling with people the next. Toward evening, a woman and her daughter came by to ask for advice. The woman's mother was an Iranian green card holder, and though the White House eventually said it would allow green card holders to enter the country, she wanted to talk to the lawyers just in case.  Another man sitting near the clinic leaned over and told the lawyers he was grateful for their work. He said he was expecting a relative to arrive and it had been an hour since the flight landed at 4:30 p.m. Should he be worried?  After 15 minutes, the Iranian woman happily returned with her mother and filled out a quick intake form. The man's relative also emerged from the gate. They loaded up a luggage cart, waving as they passed by. The evening volunteers' shifts had begun. One man knelt on the ground to draw a larger \"lawyer\" sign on a white poster, slowly tracing the letters in black ink.  For organizers and civil rights groups, the airport legal clinics have helped lay the groundwork for future rapid-response legal efforts, showing how quickly volunteers can show up and the willingness among groups to share information and resources. Now organizers are likely to shift toward helping undocumented immigrants by providing free legal services and setting up know-your-rights trainings that can be deployed quickly.  \"The legal profession as a whole is standing up,\" said Wilson.", "date": "2017/02/13", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trumps-immigration-travel-ban-volunteer-lawyers-legal-help", "title": "This Is What It's Like on the Front Lines of Trump's Travel Ban"}, {"text": "A woman holds up a sign outside the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.  A panel of three federal appeals court judges on Thursday dealt another blow to President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees from entering the United States. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled against the Trump administration and upheld a Seattle court ruling that blocked implementation of the ban. That means that travelers from the seven countries, as well as refugees, can continue to enter the United States as the case proceeds through court.  In a unanimous decision, the judges rejected the Trump administration's argument that courts could not challenge the presidents executive order: \"The Government has taken the position that the Presidents decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. The judges argued there was no precedent to support this argument, saying that it \"runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\" It also noted \"the serious nature of the allegations the States have raised with respect to their religious discrimination claims.  President Trump immediately responded to the decision, tweeting:  SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017  Last Friday, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the ban in response to lawsuits by the state governments of Washington and Minnesota alleging the ban was discriminatory and harmful to its residents. The Trump administration filed an emergency motion opposing the decision, and judges heard oral arguments on Tuesday over whether to uphold the judge's ruling. During the hearing, judges expressed skepticism of the Justice Department's claim the executive order was justified and that courts should not be challenging the president's assessment of national security risks.  Noah Purcell, the solicitor general for Washington state, argued the order caused chaos, urging the court to serve as a check on executive power. \"It has always been the judicial branch's role to say what the law is and to serve as a check on abuses by the executive branch,\" said Purcell. \"That judicial rule has never been more important in recent memory than it is today.\"  Yet judges also grilled the solicitor general, pressing him to identify precisely how the travel ban discriminated against Muslims if the order didn't affect the majority of the Muslim population, as well as to specify the number of people harmed. Purcell argued the state did not need to prove the ban harmed every Muslim, but that there was a clear intention to do so, citing Trump's campaign promise to ban Muslim visitors. He also alluded to Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani's comments about how Trump had asked for advice on how to legally implement a Muslim ban.  Trump lashed out against the courts on Wednesday, calling the hearing \"disgraceful.\" \"I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won't call it biased,\" Trump told a gathering of law enforcement officials in Washington, DC. \"But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right.\"  He added, \"I think it's sad. I think it's a sad day. I think our security is at risk today.\"  The executive order, signed on January 27, led to widespread protests throughout the country and confusion among Customs and Border Protection officers over how to implement the directive. Hundreds of people were detained at airports or barred from entering the United States, and at least tens of thousands of visas were revoked. At least four states have sued the Trump administration over the order, in addition to dozens of lawsuits brought by civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.  The decision will likely be appealed and head to the Supreme Court.", "date": "2017/02/09", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trump-executive-order-travel-ban-appeals-decision-1", "title": "A Federal Appeals Court Just Ruled Against Trump's \"Muslim Ban\""}, {"text": "Protesters at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York  Tens of thousands of visas belonging to foreigners from seven predominantly Muslim countries have been provisionally revoked following President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel by people from those countries to the United States. The exact number of revoked visas remains unclear. An attorney representing the US government said in a Virginia court on Friday that more than 100,000 visas had been revoked. But the State Department later disputed the numbers, claiming that fewer than 60,000 visas had been revoked.  A State Department memo released earlier this week revealed that the visa revocations were a result of Trump's executive order, but it was only in court on Friday that the number of revoked visas was made public. \"You could hear the gasps in the courtroom,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Justice Center, told the New York Times. The visa-holders were not notified of the revocations, the paper reported. The change strands thousands of people outside the United States and prevents thousands of others in the country from leaving and coming back.  The State Department memo notes that there are exemptions for some diplomatic visas, and waivers could be applied on a \"case-by-case basis\" at the determination of the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.

At least one Iranian woman who was temporarily held at the airport was released, according to NBC. SFO released a statement on Sunday saying that it shared the concerns of protesters and had requested a \"full briefing\" from Customs and Border Protection.  Hundreds of people rallied at San Francisco International Airport Saturday, temporarily occupying the arrivals level in protest of President Trump's \"Muslim ban.\" The crowd moved into the terminal after reports circulated that six immigrants were not being allowed to leave the airport as a result of the executive order.  The crowd chanted, No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all,\" and \"let the lawyers in.\"  Anoop Prasad, an attorney with the Bay Area-based Asian Law Caucus, told Mother Jones that he was aware of at least two US green card holders from the targeted countries who were en route to San Francisco and worried they would be detained. He said the organization had received dozens of phone calls from concerned community members about whether immigrants with legal permanent resident status would be allowed to enter the country. Prasad said he and other Asian Law Caucus members had been trying to get in touch with Customs and Border Protection officers so lawyers could talk to the families and be present for any interviews. As of Saturday night, they had yet to receive a response.

Multiple refugees were detained by customs officials across the country, as lawyers scrambled to file lawsuits against the Trump administration, and protesters planned demonstrations outside airports.  On Friday, Trump signed an executive order requiring immigration authorities to:  Suspend all refugee resettlement for 120 days and reduce the number of refugees resettled in the country to 50,000;  Immediately deny entry to the United States to anyone from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days;  Ban Syrian refugees from resettling in the United States;  Prioritize refugee claims \"on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"  Confusion reigned as details began to emerge about just how many people might be covered by the executive orderpotentially throwing hundreds of thousands of travelers into legal limbo.

The New York Times reports that passengers were turned away at airports in Dubai and Istanbul, and at least one family was ejected from a flight.  Iran issued a swift response to Trumps ban, saying it would ban all US citizens from entering the country. \"The US decision to restrict travel for Muslims to the US, even if for a temporary period of three months, is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular to the great nation of Iran, Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \"Despite the claims of combating terrorism and keeping American people safe, it will be recorded in history as a big gift to extremists and their supporters.\" The ban would remain in place until the US lifted its restrictions on Iran, according to the statement.  Civil rights and refugee resettlement organizations are readying themselves for a fight against the order. On Friday evening, the Council for American-Islamic Relations announced it would file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order. \"There is no evidence that refugeesthe most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nationare a threat to national security,\" CAIR national litigation director Lena Masri said in a press release.  The American Civil Liberties Union also filed suit Saturday morning on behalf of two Iraqi men who were already on their way to the United States and had been detained at New York's JFK airport. One, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had worked as an interpreter during the Iraq War, was released Saturday afternoon.

On January 20, president-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated into office. The swearing-in ceremony will begin at 11:30 a.m. followed by several celebrations, including galas and inaugural balls, throughout the weekend.  But if Trump's critics have anything to do with it, the inauguration won't entirely be festive: Dozens of groups have announced rallies and protests leading up to the historic event, including the Women's March on Washington, which is expected to draw as many as 200,000 attendees. Washington, DC officials say they're preparing for at least a million visitors to the city for the inauguration and protests. And it's not just the capital that's bracing for January 20. Hundreds of cities expect local rallies to take place.  These are some of the major events that have already taken place, as well as ones that are planned. Follow our live coverage of highlights from the inauguration protests here.  January 14: March for Immigrants and Refugees  Part of the We Are Here to Stay campaign, immigrant and refugee rights groups organized to show solidarity for immigrants and other vulnerable communities and to stand up against hateful rhetoric against immigrants. The grassroots campaign, led by United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant justice group, urged local groups to start their own chapters to protest Trump's immigration proposals. Events took place in numerous cities, including Tucson, Albuquerque, Chicago, and Houston.  January 14: We Shall Not Be Moved March on Washington  Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network held a march on Washington to call for Trump to continue protecting civil rights. \"Protecting the civil rights of citizens and the voting rights of people that have been excluded, providing health care for all Americans and equal opportunity should supersede any of the beltway partisan fights that we are inevitably headed into,\" said the group.  January 15: Our First Stand: Save Health Care  Led by Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), Democratic members of Congress and other health care groups protested the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act with rallies across the country. House leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held an event in San Francisco, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was in Los Angeles, and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), along with Mayor Marty Walsh, led a rally in Boston, Massachusetts. Sanders made headlines recently when he brought a giant banner of a Trump tweet to Congress (Trump tweeted last May that he would not make cuts to social security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and drew thousands to his own event in Warren, Michigan.  January 15: Writers Resist rallies  Launched by poet Erin Belieu, Writer's Resist calls itself a national network of writers \"driven to defend the ideals of a free, just and compassionate democratic society.\" The group asked writers to independently organize local events where writers read from historic and contemporary texts on democracy and free expression. More than 75 events were planned, including in Seattle, Portland, Omaha, London and Hong Kong, according to its website. The flagship event was held in New York City, where writers gathered at the steps of the New York Public Library for readings, performances, and a pledge to defend the First Amendment.  January 19: Reclaim Our Schools Day of Action  Several teachers unions and education groups, including the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have organized under a newly-formed group called the National Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools. They plan to stage a national day of action to \"defend\" schools from Donald Trump and his calls to dismantle the public education system. Educators have called Trump and his secretary of education pick, Betsy DeVos, an \"existential threat to public schools.\"  January 19: Busboys and Poets Peace Ball  Described as an alternative to anti-Trump protests, the Busboys and Poets Peace Ball will be a \"gathering to celebrate the accomplishments and successes of the past four years\" at the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Notable attendees include celebrities, authors, and organizers such as Solange, Alice Walker, Amy Goodman and Alicia Garza. The event had room for more than 3,000 people and has already sold out, founder Andy Shallal told ThinkProgress.  January 20: #InaugurateTheResistance  The Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER) Coalition secured a permit to stage a \"mass protest\" against Donald Trump, starting at 7 a.m. at DC's Freedom Plaza. Other groups holding marches include the Occupy Movement, the Democratic Socialists of America, and #DisruptJ20, a group which says it wants to shut down the inauguration.  Separately, the DCMJ, a lobbying group focused on marijuana legislation, says it will distribute free joints to celebrate pot legalization in D.C.  January 20: Student walkouts  College students across the country are planning campus walkouts, organized by groups including Socialist Students and Students for a Democratic Society.  January 21: Women's March  The Women's March on Washington, which started as a Facebook page after the election, will be by far one of the biggest events after the inauguration. The march's organizers say up to 200,000 people could attend, and the event has drawn such enthusiasm and support that additional Facebook pages have been set up for parents who are bringing their children, as well as a \"MarchBnb\" website for people in need of housing.  Other marches inspired by the Women's March are also being held in other cities in the US and worldwide. A full list can be found here.

We often think of empathy as a good thing. The ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes and feel their pain makes us more understanding and compassionate. In the aftermath of the divisive presidential election, there's been a call for voters to try to empathize with people who hold opposing views.  But what if empathy actually isn't as helpful to us as we think it isand might even get us into trouble?

In this episode of Inquiring Minds, Bloom tells host Indre Viskontas that empathy can lead to poor decision-making and even get in the way of doing the right thing. \"Many philosophers argue that [empathy] is an essential catalyst for good behavior,\" says Bloom. \"I argue that although sometimes it can lead to good behavior, more often it gets us into trouble.\"  Bloom focuses on one type of empathy in particular, which he defines as emotional empathy: the ability to feel the feelings of others. Studies have shown that when we make decisions based on how we feel, we almost always end up making biased decisions, he says. Take the idea of giving to charity. Why do we tend to give more to certain victims, such as children or abandoned animals? That's because we tend to feel more sympathy toward groups we prefer or individuals we can identify with. Conversely, we're less likely to feel empathy toward people or groups who don't align with our values. Empathy, says Bloom, is \"what makes us focus our energy on one small child and ignore the suffering of thousands.\"  Being too sensitive to someone else's emotions can get in the way of roles where some suffering is necessary, such as those held by doctors, psychologists, or even parents, says Bloom. In situations where a child is emotionally distressed or angry, parents shouldn't just absorb their child's feelings; they need to be able to step back and remain calm. \"Being a good parent not only involves being able to withstand the short-term suffering of your kid, it involves being able to cause the short-term suffering of your kids,\" says Bloom, such as getting them to do their homework or saying they can't go out. Being too attuned to someone's emotions can cause you to feel emotionally depleted or burnt out. \"If you're too empathic, you can't do any of those things, you're so caught up in the pain and pleasure of the people around you. Too much empathy makes for a bad parent and a bad doctor and a bad friend.\"  Empathy is \"what makes us focus our energy on one small child and ignore the suffering of thousands.\"  Bloom is all too aware of how offputting his argument soundshe even starts his book by addressing some of the counterarguments his readers might present. But he stresses that he isn't dismissing empathy altogether. What Bloom proposes instead is \"rational compassion.\" Rather than placing emotions at the center of our decisions, we should strive to be compassionate and kind to people, regardless of our feelings, he argues. Suppressing empathic emotions and focusing on more rational analysis can lead to better policy-making, allow us to focus on the long-term effects of problems such as climate change rather than our current comfort and well-being, and, ultimately, make us better people.  So do Clinton supporters need to empathize with Trump fans?  No, says Bloom. \"I think the discussion gets caught up in a failure to make distinctions,\" he says. Clinton voters \"shouldn't empathize with Trump voters; Trump voters shouldn't empathize with Clinton voters. It's not something we're very good at. It just leads to moral confusion. It won't make us better people. It's exhausting.\"  Instead, we should try to understand people on the other side of the political divide, without needing to feel the same feelings. \"There's all sorts of reasons to understand the motives of political opponents,\" he says. \"We have to share the same country.\" And, he stresses, understanding doesn't require moral approval. \"Many Clinton supporters would say to me, 'They don't deserve my empathy because they're racist and sexist and so on,'\" he says. \"And my response is, 'So what?' You should try to understand people even if their motives are awful.\"  Inquiring Minds is a podcast hosted by neuroscientist and musician Indre Viskontas and Kishore Hari, the director of the Bay Area Science Festival.

Shortly after Donald Trump won the presidential election, a number of colleges and universities declared themselves \"sanctuary campuses\" for students, faculty, and staff who may face the threat of deportation under the new administration. The University of Pennsylvania, Trump's alma mater, said it would not allow US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents onto campus without a warrant, nor would it share private student information unless required. And in late November, the University of California announced a similar set of policies aimed at protecting undocumented students across the entire UC system.  Some universities, however have held back on making those sorts of announcements. Harvard University President Drew Faust, for example, defended the university's decision to not declare itself a sanctuary campus by saying it might endanger students rather than protect them, and the university did not want to offer \"false and misleading assurance\" to students. Other schools have argued that sanctuary policies may put them at risk of losing federal funding. (Some state officials have already threatened to cut funding for universities declaring sanctuary status.)  So how much do sanctuary campus policies actually help students? Here are a few things to keep in mind.  Sanctuary doesn't come with any legal backing.  By declaring themselves sanctuaries, schools aren't necessarily invoking any kind of law or protection. As the American Council on Education notes, sanctuary doesn't involve a legal status that is protected or recognized under federal law.  Schools have defined their sanctuary policies in different ways, too: New York University's sanctuary campus declaration, for instance, included nine bullet points outlining already existing policies around financial aid and nondiscrimination, as well as an announcement that it would launch a campus \"climate survey\" to take stock of people's academic and working experiences on campus. Swarthmore College, a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, noted it would not participate or enroll in \"E-Verify,\" a federal program used for screening an immigrant's immigration status, and that it would not make campus housing decisions based on immigration status. The announcements have shared common themes so far, however, such as reaffirming the school's commitment to undocumented students and other vulnerable populations, or refusing to release private informationin many cases restating policies that already were in place.  There are already federal laws in place that protect student information.  Most universities that have declared themselves sanctuaries say they will not turn over student information to ICEand that's likely because doing so would conflict with student privacy laws. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), for instance, prohibits schools from releasing a student's personal information without the student's (or a parent's) consent. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) similarly prevents student medical records from being released without valid consent.  However, there are limits: Under FERPA, schools must release records without consent in some cases, such as under a subpoena, and information like addresses and phone numbers can be published in school directories without students specifically opting out.  ICE officers generally avoid conducting raids on college campuses.  ICE has a long-standing policy to not attempt raids or arrests at certain \"sensitive\" locations, such as schools, churches, or public gatherings, including at marches or rallies. Though there has been some concern that the Trump administration could reverse or even revoke those policies, immigration advocates say that the policies have been in place for so long that changing them would be extremely difficult.  If ICE officers were to come onto campus, however, things get unclear. Some universities, such as Wesleyan, have said they will not voluntarily assist ICE officers with deportation measures. The University of California's statement says police officers at its 10 campuses will not help conduct ICE investigations based upon a student's legal status or comply with requests to detain students, unless required by law or if the student has been convicted of a felony. But campus authority only goes so far: Brown University, for instance, said in a statement to the Washington Post that \"based on consultation with legal counsel, we understand that private universities and colleges do not have legal protection from entry by members of law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" The University of Wisconsin-Madison told Inside Higher Ed that the city's police department had full authority to enforce laws on campus without permission from the university.  But schools can still take steps to ensure that sanctuary policies protect students.  The National Immigration Law Center, along with several immigration advocacy organizations, recently issued a model resolution for how K-12 schools and universities can protect undocumented students, faculty, and staff. Beyond making sanctuary declarations, schools should consider laying out specific, school-wide policiesand making sure that all campus staff and police are trained and aware of them, said the NILC's Jessica Hanson. The NILC recommends, for instance, that all campus personnel receive training on how to handle information requests from ICE officers and to prohibit them from using campus facilities for immigration enforcement.  Hansen also stressed that schools can help by offering more resources to support undocumented students, such as helping fund legal resources or mental-health servicessomething students have called for in numerous petitions. Advocates also say the public message still matters: By publicly declaring themselves sanctuary campuses, universities can reaffirm their commitment to students. \"It says to students that we support you, we affirm your identity,\" said Meng So, the director of UC-Berkeley's Undocumented Student Program. \"I think schools are going to be safe havens that communities seek to find themselves in. Students need to hear and understand that their top leaders care about them.\"", "date": "2017/01/05", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/sanctuary-campus-college-dreamers-deportation", "title": "Colleges Across America Are Fighting Back Against Trump's Deportation Threats"}, {"text": "Emptying out from brunch spots wielding wickedly pointed signs, and chanting, \"We want a leader, not a creepy tweeter!\" thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators from the LGBT community met for a rally on hallowed turf on Saturday afternoon: the plaza outside the Stonewall nightclub in New York City's West Villagerecently designated by the Obama administration as a National Monument for its historic role in the long fight for gay rights.  Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate minority leader, received a mixed reception when he appeared in front of the microphone. \"Grow some balls!\" several people shouted. \"Block everything!\"a reference to the ground-swell of progressive voters demanding Schumer lead Senate Democrats in styming President Trump's agenda and appointments. (Protesters also gathered on Tuesday night outside the minority leader's Brooklyn apartment.)  Schumer's pledge to block Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary\"She can take her conversion therapy back to Michigan!\"was, on the other hand, met with cheers and applause.  But it was clear from talking to multiple people in the LGBT community and their allies on this chilly but sunny Saturday that battle-lines have been drawn: many felt there could be no compromise with the Trump administration.  \"It's time to stop giving in,\" said Alan Brodherson, a 52-year-old attorney. \"Over the years, that's what the Democrats have consistently done.\"  \"I don't believe in complacency,\" he said. \"Be vigilant.\"  Taylor James, a 29-year-old Canadian dancer and photographer who now lives in Los Angeles, was also impressed by the renewed sense of purpose amongst protesters. \"It's inspiring. In 50 years, in 40 years, I'll look back to see how I stood up,\" he said. \"It feels very personal.\"  Trump, he said, \"forces us to show up.\"  Most people I spoke to said they turned up to show solidarity with the immigrants and refugees targeted by President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily barring travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, along with suspending America's refugee program. (The Trump administration suffered a set-back on Friday night when Judge James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle issued an order temporarily blocking Trump's executive action.)  Jaimie McGovern, 29, showed up simply because \"the LGBT community is across every spectrum. We're Muslim, we're Hispanic.\" She surveyed the turnout: \"This is fantastic.\"  \"We're not going to stand by while Trump takes away rights one by one,\" said IT worker David Vazquez, 31. \"It seems like every day he comes out with something new. We need to keep from being discouraged.\"  Mike Hisey, dressed as Kellyanne Conway with a blond wig and an outfit that evoked her now-famous inauguration getup, stood outside Stonewall itself, attracting a constant stream of requests for photographs with a deadpan face. \"Protesting and march works,\" he said.  \"I've been protesting for 30 years.\"", "date": "2017/02/04", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/nyc-lgbt-protest-photos-stonewall-saturday", "title": "Here Are the Very Best Signs From New York City's Big LGBT Solidarity March"}, {"text": "Ataui Deng signed to Trump Models in 2008. \"It blew my mind to be working with all of these unique designers,\" she told Teen Vogue.  One of Donald Trump's top fashion models was a refugee who escaped war and famine in her home country of Sudan as a child before rising to the top of New York's fashion world as a recruit for the president's prestigious modeling firm.  But if she had tried to come to the United States in 2017while her former boss now sits in the White Houseinstead of in 2004, Ataui Deng may never have been allowed into this country.  At the end of his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order immediately suspending America's refugee resettlement program for 120 days (while barring Syrian refugees indefinitely) and halting for 90 days all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Sudan.  The constitutionality of that order is currently being challenged in court by a coalition of legal groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union, after a federal judge in New York issued a temporary nationwide stay late Saturday night barring deportation for people trapped in airports around the country (or those currently en route). Several other federal court rulings have since sided with the challengers to Trump's presidential order.  While the president denied on Saturday that his current plan amounts to a \"Muslim ban,\" as a candidate he called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"  No matter what it's called, if Trump's order had been in effect back in 2004, it would have prevented his own modeling agency, Trump Model Management, from hiring a big new star.  A photo posted by StyleVitae (@stylevitae) on Jun 6, 2016 at 4:26am PDT  Deng, now 25, came to the United States when she was 12. She was one of some 3,500 Sudanese refugees who fled the war-ravaged country for the United States in 2004. Her family was resettled in San Antonio, Texas, where her mother worked as a housekeeper and a custodian at a local hospital, and the young Ataui learned English and dreamed of being a model, according to a 2009 profile in the San Antonio Express-News. \"I've never met a student with such a strong determination,\" Deng's English teacher told the Express-News.  Deng signed with Trump's agency in September 2008 at the age of 16, after she was spotted at a talent competition in a shopping mall. She was quickly whisked away to hit the runways of New York's fashion week, promoted by some of the best in the business. \"It blew my mind to be working with all of these unique designers,\" Ataui told Teen Vogue in 2010. She worked with fashion bigwigs including Zac Posen, Oscar de la Renta, Diane von Furstenberg, and the late L'Wren Scott. She even became the face of a 2013 fashion campaign for pop superstar Rihanna.  \"I think Ataui, through the hardships that she's had in life, through what she's seen, it's probably made her stronger.\"  Deng was part of a wave of popular models of Sudanese descent who hit the American fashion industry around the same time, including Grace Bol, Atong Arjok (who is also a Trump Model), and Ajak Deng. (Ataui Deng did not respond to an emailed interview request from Mother Jones.)  Trump's agency was thrilled by her performanceand praised her tough history as a refugee. \"I think Ataui, through the hardships that she's had in life, through what she's seen, it's probably made her stronger,\" Corinne Nicolas, president of Trump Model Management, told the San Antonio Express-News. \"Ataui was in demand by every agent in New York.\"  \"I do think she has the potential to be one of the big names,\" Nicolas said.  Deng's New York career wasn't all rosy. She was reported missing in 2014, after she secretly checked herself into a Manhattan hospital battling mental health problems, according to news reports at the time. Her mysterious disappearance sparked a celebrity-fueled social-media campaign to find her, including posts from Rihanna. Her modeling career appears to have tapered off somewhat after the incident, and she is no longer listed on the Trump Models website.  Last August, Mother Jones published the accounts of three former Trump Models, all of them foreigners, who described modeling for the president's agency while holding tourist visas that did not permit them to work in the United States. Trump holds an 85 percent stake in the company; he recently signed a letter resigning as a director of the company.  Trump Model Management did not respond to multiple interview requests about how the president's immigration ban might affect its business. On Saturday afternoon, first lady Melania Trump's own immigration attorney, Michael Wildes, who has also represented the Trump Organization in numerous immigration cases, spoke out against the president's order, during an interview on MSNBC. \"This is not the way you deal with people's lives,\" he said.  Despite facing several federal lawsuits and unleashing travel chaos around the world, Trump asserted on Saturday that the implementation of his executive order was running smoothly. \"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" he said.", "date": "2017/01/30", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/trump-models-sudan-refugee-ataui-deng", "title": "Trump's Ban Would Have Barred One of His Top Fashion Models\u0089\u00db\u00d3a Sudanese War Refugee"}, {"text": "First Lady Melania Trump's own immigration attorney, who has also represented the Trump Organization in numerous immigration cases, condemned President Donald Trump's so-called \"Muslim ban\" on Saturday afternoon, during an interview on MSNBC.  \"How can we turn our backs on these individuals?\" New York lawyer Michael Wildes said, adding that he thought the legal disputes over the executive order would eventually be taken up by the Supreme Court. \"I think it is going to get worse before it gets better.\"  \"This is not the way you deal with people's lives,\" he said.  Wildes has previously represented Trump Models, President Trump's New York modeling agency, and secured visas for models appearing in Trump's Miss Universe pageants.  Last September, Melania Trump attempted to clear up questions surrounding her own immigration to the US, when she released a signed letter from Wildes flatly denying allegations that she had worked illegally in the US before receiving a proper work visa. But new documents uncovered by the AP less than two months laterincluding financial ledgers and contractscontradicted the public account given by Trump and Wildes, revealing the Slovenia-born model had in fact received paid New York modeling assignments in the seven weeks before she received her work visa.

Economist Peter Navarro, who will serve in a newly created White House trade position, is an anti-China activist who might be put in charge of spearheading efforts to slap a massive tariff on Chinese imports. Trump has also threatened to label China a \"currency manipulator,\" a largely symbolic move that would nonetheless infuriate China's leaders and could spark trade retaliations. In his 2011 book Time to Get Tough, Trump labeled China's leaders \"enemies\" and wrote, \"We shouldn't entertain Communists and beg for a few tiny contracts.\" What else, he asked, \"do you call the people who are destroying your children and grandchildren's future_who are ruining our way of life?\"  But when it comes to his own business deals, Trump's actions don't exactly align with his hawkish rhetoric. In the past, he has tried repeatedly to land big real estate deals in China with state-run Chinese companies as partners. He's sought access to China's famously tricky business marketseven for his reality TV show, The Apprentice.  Trump still owes potentially hundreds of millions in debt to one massive, state-run Chinese bank, while leasing a floor of Trump Tower office space in Manhattan to anothera contract that's up for renegotiation in October 2019.
