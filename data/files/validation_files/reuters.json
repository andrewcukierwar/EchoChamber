[{"title": "Trump administration issues final rule on stricter Obamacare enrollment", "text": "An emergency sign points to the entrance to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, U.S. March 23, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWASHINGTON The Trump administration on Thursday issued a final rule that will shorten the Obamacare enrollment period and give insurers more of what they say they need in the individual insurance market, likely making it harder for some consumers to purchase insurance, healthcare experts said.\n\nIt could also raise out-of-pocket medical expenses, the experts said, because it gives insurers more flexibility in determining the value of their coverage.\n\nThe rule, which takes effect later this year, comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have renewed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, after an effort to pass a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives failed last month.\n\nIssued by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and first proposed in February, the rule aims to aid insurers, who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the individual insurance markets set up by Obamacare. Several major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna Inc, have announced plans to exit some state exchanges in 2018.\n\nInsurers welcomed the rule but said there is still too much uncertainty in the market. On Wednesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he may withhold Obamacare payments to insurers that amount to about $7 billion a year to force Democrats back to the negotiating table.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement that funding for the payments must continue uninterrupted. Otherwise, she said premiums will rise 20 percent across the market and more insurers would drop out of the exchanges.\n\nThe changes under Thursday's final rule include a shortened open enrollment period for Obamacare plans. They also make it harder for people to enroll outside that period, which is allowed under certain circumstances such as a pregnancy or a move.\n\nThe rule could also allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments and make it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans, according to healthcare industry experts.\n\nInsurers say \"gaming the system\" has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers.\n\nThe rule also gives states broader authority by removing the federal government's role in overseeing doctor and hospital networks included in insurance plans. Republicans have said any healthcare reform or overhaul must give states more flexibility.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act enabled 20 million Americans to gain insurance, mostly through the individual insurance markets set up by the law or through an expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled.\n\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Tom Brown)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-rule-idUSKBN17F2RX"}, {"title": "New York police arrest 25 at immigration protest in Trump Tower", "text": "Protestors sit down in the lobby of Trump Tower as New York City Police officers (NYPD) prepare to make arrests in New York City, U.S., April 13, 2017.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald J. Trump is planning to increase U.S. defense spending by $54 billion next year. But a series of recent reports by the Defense Department Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office say that Pentagon accounting systems will struggle to track how the money is spent.\n\nThe reports found that the Pentagon remains unable to accurately track its $591 billion annual budget and experiences billions of dollars in accounting gaps and errors each year despite two decades of reform efforts. Taken together, the reports show that many of the endemic accounting problems exposed in a 2013 Reuters investigative series remain in place.\n\n\u201cThese deficiencies not only affect (the Department of Defense's) ability to have auditable financial statements,\u201d a Feb. 9 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found, \u201cthey also affect its ability to make sound decisions on missions and operations.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the White House's Office of Management Budget (OMB) said he was confident that Defense Secretary James Mattis would properly spend the additional funds.\n\n\u201cThe need to replenish our military and bolster American security is unquestioned and an important priority of this president,\" OMB Communications Director John Czwartacki said in a statement. \"We believe Secretary Mattis will deploy all of his resources in the most effective and efficient way possible.\u201d\n\nCritics of wasteful Pentagon spending say increasing the Defense Department budget is unwise when the department is unable to account for what it already has.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project in Washington. \u201cReform isn\u2019t going to happen as long as the spigot is turned on.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s continued accounting problems are drawing particular scrutiny now because the Defense Department faces a congressionally mandated legal deadline of Sept. 30, 2017, to become ready for its first audit ever. Unlike every other U.S. government department, the Pentagon has never undergone an audit because its financial records are in such disarray.\n\nA spokesman for the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s office said he is confident it will meet the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe Department is committed and on track to be ready to undergo a full financial statement audit in (fiscal year) 2018,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Eric D. Badger said in an email.\n\nDEEP CUTS\n\nAt the same time Trump proposes to boost defense spending, he has called for deep cuts to other areas, a White House summary of his proposed 2018 budget shows. Whether Congress will accept or reject Trump's proposals is unclear.\n\nTrump calls for cutting the State Department\u2019s budget by $10.1 billion, or 28%. Among other things, U.S. payments to support the United Nations would be cut.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would take a particularly big hit. Trump would cut $2.6 billion, or 31%, of its budget. The White House document says the budget would eliminate more than 50 EPA programs, and cut EPA\u2019s research and development budget by $233 million, or 52%. The budget for grants to states for lead clean-up would be cut by 30% to $9.8 million.\n\nThe recent watchdog reports on the Defense Department found that it lacks a unified, functioning accounting system. As Reuters reported in its 2013 series, the Pentagon has hundreds of independent systems, built ad hoc and some dating from the 1970s, that are riddled with errors and incapable of sharing accurate data.\n\nBillions of dollars disappear from accounting records. The military has spent large sums building new systems meant to solve the problem, but so far they have not.\n\nA March 16 Defense Department Inspector General report said the Navy could not find any records to back up how it had spent $866 million in the first quarter of 2016 in U.S. military operations in Afghanistan. The report said that as a result, there was no way to know what the money actually was used for.\n\nA Navy spokeswoman, Lieutenant Kara YingLing, referred Reuters to the Navy\u2019s official response to the report, which said the Navy agreed with the Inspector General\u2019s conclusions but said its accounting problems will not be fixed until it begins using a new computer system in 2019. YingLing said the Navy is \u201con track\u201d to help the Pentagon meet its Sept. 30 audit deadline.\n\nThe Feb. 9 GAO report said the Pentagon's continued bookkeeping errors affect the federal government as a whole. Defense spending makes up such a large part of the federal budget that the department's unreliable data skews accounting for the entire U.S. government, the GAO said.\n\nSYSTEMIC RISK\n\nThe report noted that the Defense Department has been on the GAO\u2019s list of \u201cHigh Risk\u201d entities that represent threats to the federal government\u2019s financial well-being since 1995. The report said the Pentagon has remained on the list because of \u201clong-standing deficiencies with its financial management systems.\"\n\nThe GAO report noted that the Pentagon had hired large independent accounting firms for each of the military services to try to help them meet the Sept. 30 audit deadline. But the report said the firms have found so many problems that the ability of the Pentagon to meet the deadline remains in doubt.\n\nA separate Defense Department Inspector General report issued on March 23, 2017, found that the Army continues to be unable to balance its checkbook. The report concluded that the problem for the Army grew worse in 2016.\n\nThe report said that for October 2015, the Army had 177,921 discrepancies. The monthly numbers rose steadily to 790,551 for June 2016. The report did not give dollar amounts for those months.\n\nArmy spokesman Wayne Hall said the number of discrepancies continued to increase in 2017 because planned fixes to computer systems have not yet been made. He said the Army is working on building more reliable systems.\n\nThe report said that because rules require that the Army\u2019s numbers exactly match in monthly reports to the Treasury, the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must find a way to make them match. Their solution was to enter made-up numbers to make it appear falsely that the Army\u2019s numbers do match.\n\nThe report said that for March 2016, there were $1.9 billion in such \u201cforced balance entries.\u201d Hall said the Army must make the numbers match under federal rules.\n\nIn separate reports, the Inspector General found that other military services have also had problems balancing their financial numbers with the Treasury\u2019s. Accountants interviewed by Reuters said that such large discrepancies would be considered accounting fraud in the corporate world.\n\nBadger, the spokesman for the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s office, said any errors by the military services were unintentional.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose any accusation of intentionally misrepresenting our books,\u201d Badger said in an email. \u201cMany manual accounting adjustments are often caused by the ineffective design of legacy business or financial systems.\u201d\n\nTrump has said the $54 billion in increased defense spending will send a \u201cmessage to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve.\u201d Trump has also vowed to negotiate cheaper contracts with defense contractors, a problem also cited in recent watchdog reports.\n\nIn a March 2016 report, the Inspector General found that the Air Force had spent \u201cbillions\u201d on a contract to maintain one type of jet engine, without first getting any idea of a fair price.\n\nThe open-ended contract, with a guaranteed profit margin regardless of cost, was awarded in 2011. The report said that before signing the contract the Air Force obtained no data on the actual cost of the repairs and how the costs compared to private-sector rates.\n\nThe exact amount of the contract was redacted from the report. The Inspector General has not ruled on a March 2016 Freedom of Information Act request filed by Reuters that asked for the redacted information to be made public.\n\nInfographic ID: '2muNwQ4'\n\n(Editing by David Rohde.)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pentagon-idUSKBN17F1PQ"}, {"title": "Trump signs resolution allowing U.S. states to block family planning funds", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners.\n\n\"This is a major pro-life victory,\" said the most powerful Republican in the House of Representatives, Speaker Paul Ryan, adding that a regulation enacted under Democratic former President Barack Obama had forced states to fund Planned Parenthood, a national non-profit that provides contraception, health screenings, and abortions.\n\nUnder the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted rules, both the House and Senate had passed a resolution killing Obama's regulation that had protected federal grants for clinics in states wanting to block the funding.\n\nStates such as Texas in recent years have kept the grants from going to clinics as part of the country's longstanding fight over abortion. Broadly, many Republicans seek to restrict abortion or make it illegal while Democrats have fought to keep abortion legal.\n\nThe resolution had narrowly passed the U.S. Congress, with Vice President Mike Pence called to the Senate on March 30 to break a tie vote in the chamber, where Republicans hold a slim majority. The federal government can never again create a \"substantially similar\" regulation under the review law.\n\nThe grants, known as \"Title X\" funds, were already barred from going directly to abortion services but under the now-null regulation Planned Parenthood clinics were assured they could receive money even in the face of state objections.\n\n\"Allowing states to withhold Title X funding from family planning clinics won\u2019t make anyone safer or healthier \u2013 it will instead place essential services out of reach,\" said Diane Horvath-Cosper, a medical doctor and fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, adding that for many people the clinics are the only place where they can receive affordable health services such as disease testing.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-abortion-idUSKBN17F2IH"}, {"title": "Trump and Yellen may not be an odd couple after all", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON At first glance, U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen may have little in common.\n\nYellen is an academic economist and veteran of Democratic administrations who is committed to an open global economy, while Trump is a real estate mogul with an electoral base suspicious of the economic order Yellen helped to create.\n\nYet the two may have interests in common now that Trump is president and both want to get as many Americans working as possible.\n\nSince her appointment as Fed chair in February 2014, Yellen has kept interest rates low and she currently pledges to raise them only slowly even though unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is at its lowest in nearly ten years.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's election campaign promises to cut taxes, spend money on infrastructure and deregulate banking, have helped propel a surge in the U.S. Conference Board's consumer confidence index to its highest level since the internet stocks crash 16 years ago.\n\nFormer Fed staff and colleagues who know Yellen said Trump's surprising remarks this week in a Wall Street Journal interview, in which he did not rule out Yellen's reappointment to a new four year term next year, are not as outlandish as they may appear now that the president has a vested interest in keeping markets and the economy on an even keel.\n\nAnd the same staff and colleagues say Yellen may well accept reappointment, despite Trump's criticism of her during last year's election campaign.\n\nMany in Trump's Republican party have called for tighter monetary policy and a less activist Fed, but \"the president would not really find that useful,\" said former Fed vice chair Donald Kohn.\n\nIf Trump fills three existing Federal Reserve board vacancies with people Yellen thinks she could work with, \"it would be really difficult to turn down\" a reappointment when her term as chair expires in February 2018.\n\n\"If she continues to do well, he\u2019d be nuts to ditch her for an unknown quantity,\" said University of California, Berkeley, economics professor Andrew Rose, a long-time colleague and co-author with Yellen of an oft-cited study of labor markets.\n\nYellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground, and she has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth.\n\nIn a slow return to more normal monetary policy, Yellen has stopped the purchase of additional financial securities by the Fed and in December 2015 began raising short term interest rates for the first time in 10 years.\n\nSo far those policy shifts have been engineered with little apparent impact on job growth, and so mesh with Trump's core election campaign promises to restore employment and earnings.\n\nThe slow rise in interest rates in the past year has also happened while U.S. stock prices have risen to record highs, though Trump has claimed the credit for himself.\n\nPRECEDENT FOR FED CHAIR TO STAY ON\n\nThere is precedent for Trump to stick with a former president's Fed chair appointment. Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the three previous Fed chairs, served at least two four year terms and were nominated by both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nHowever it may be a more difficult step for Trump.\n\nDuring last year's election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then President Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican party member.\n\nIn a particularly biting moment last year, in a campaign video advertisement, he labeled her as among the \"global special interests\" who had ruined life for middle America.\n\nThe Fed on Thursday said it had no response to Trump's comments published on Wednesday on Yellen and or on whether Yellen would consider a second term.\n\nMUCH COULD STILL GO WRONG\n\nSome of Trump's advisers and some Republican lawmakers want a more conservative Fed in which the chair has less power and would see a Yellen reappointment as yet another step away from his promise to \"drain the swamp\" of the Washington establishment.\n\nThere are also three current vacancies on the Fed's seven member Board of Governors, and unorthodox new members could make it difficult for Yellen to manage policy or accept another four year term.\n\nBut if the choice is her consensus style or someone unproven in their ability to manage public and market expectations, \"he'd be wise to reappoint her,\" said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed staffer and Berkeley colleague of Yellen's currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"I don't see what is in his interests to appoint someone who is going to jack up interest rates.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider in Washington DC and Ann Saphir in San Fransisco; editing by Clive McKeef)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-yellen-analysis-idUSKBN17F2OY"}, {"title": "Trump says North Korea problem 'will be taken care of'", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump (C) arrives to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017.

At a town hall in his conservative Florida district this week, U.S. Representative Ted Yoho drew applause for defying his own Republican Party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was President Donald Trump's first major legislative initiative.\n\nFar from paying a price back home, as Trump has threatened they would, Yoho and some of the other far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two-week congressional recess.\n\nA handful of House Freedom Caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month's defeat of Trump's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also rejected by some Republican moderates.\n\nMany supporters made clear they expect them to work with Trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation's health care system.\n\n\"I want it done,\" said Bob White, 74, after questioning Yoho on the issue during a town hall on Tuesday night in rural Putnam County, Florida. \"Wield that big stick.\"\n\nThe rebellious faction of conservatives in the House of Representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by Trump to rewrite Obamacare, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Trump has singled out the group for blame.\n\nMany caucus members refused to back the Republican leadership's bill because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. At town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs.\n\nThe reception for Yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the Republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of Congress, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at Catholic University of America, who studies congressional parties and leaders.\n\n\"The Freedom Caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents 'good job,'\" he said. \"Or if they don\u2019t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.\"\n\nMichigan Representative Justin Amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a White House adviser called on Twitter for Trump supporters to defeat him in a primary.\n\nBut in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker Kellogg Co, the four-term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan on Tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending.\n\n\"If I had to choose between Justin and Trump, I'd go with Justin for sure,\" said construction worker Eric Smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found Trump lacking conservative principles. \"At this point, I'd give Donald Trump a D.\"\n\nRetiree Cliff Ward, 72, told Amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions.\n\n\"Now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done,\" he added.\n\nGUTS TO STAND UP\n\nLiving in Georgetown, Florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, Trump voter Melvin Shebester knew little about the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe faction of small-government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream Republican leadership in the House, including an attempt to push out former Republican House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nThe 84-year-old Shebester was impressed that his congressman, Yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed.\n\n\"It takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,\" said Shebester, attending Yoho's town hall on Tuesday night at a government center in Palatka, Florida with his son and grandson.\n\n\"We can't go up there and tell Trump he's wrong,\" added his son, Steven Shebester, 56, who lives nearby.\n\nMany Republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.\n\nBut Yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. His event in Gainesville, a college town, on Monday was crowded by left-leaning activists who at times shouted him down.\n\nOn Tuesday night in Palatka, a small town in Yoho's sprawling district in north central Florida lined with oaks and Spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd.\n\nHe told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. And a phone survey of constituents found the Republican plan was as unpopular as Obamacare itself.\n\nHe said constituents gave him a clear message: \"Stay the course.\"\n\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph)\n\n(Additional reporting by Steve Friess in Michigan and Lisa Maria Garza in Texas; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-freedomcaucus-idUSKBN17F2JZ"}, {"title": "Connecticut Governor Malloy says he will not seek re-election in 2018", "text": "Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said on Thursday that he will not seek re-election in 2018, choosing to step down at the end of his second term in office.\n\n\"I will focus all my attention and energy - I will use all of my political capital from now through the end of 2018 - to continue implementing my administration's vision for a more sustainable and vibrant Connecticut economy,\" Malloy, a Democrat who served two terms as governor, said at a news conference in Hartford, the state capital.\n\nA poll released on Tuesday by Morning Consult showed that Malloy was the second-least-popular governor in the United States, with 66 percent of respondents disapproving of the job he had done.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWASHINGTON The Trump administration on Thursday issued a final rule that will shorten the Obamacare enrollment period and give insurers more of what they say they need in the individual insurance market, likely making it harder for some consumers to purchase insurance, healthcare experts said.\n\nIt could also raise out-of-pocket medical expenses, the experts said, because it gives insurers more flexibility in determining the value of their coverage.\n\nThe rule, which takes effect later this year, comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have renewed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, after an effort to pass a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives failed last month.\n\nIssued by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and first proposed in February, the rule aims to aid insurers, who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the individual insurance markets set up by Obamacare. Several major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna Inc, have announced plans to exit some state exchanges in 2018.\n\nInsurers welcomed the rule but said there is still too much uncertainty in the market. On Wednesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he may withhold Obamacare payments to insurers that amount to about $7 billion a year to force Democrats back to the negotiating table.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement that funding for the payments must continue uninterrupted. Otherwise, she said premiums will rise 20 percent across the market and more insurers would drop out of the exchanges.\n\nThe changes under Thursday's final rule include a shortened open enrollment period for Obamacare plans. They also make it harder for people to enroll outside that period, which is allowed under certain circumstances such as a pregnancy or a move.\n\nThe rule could also allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments and make it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans, according to healthcare industry experts.\n\nInsurers say \"gaming the system\" has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers.\n\nThe rule also gives states broader authority by removing the federal government's role in overseeing doctor and hospital networks included in insurance plans. Republicans have said any healthcare reform or overhaul must give states more flexibility.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act enabled 20 million Americans to gain insurance, mostly through the individual insurance markets set up by the law or through an expansion of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled.\n\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Tom Brown)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-rule-idUSKBN17F2RX"}, {"title": "New York police arrest 25 at immigration protest in Trump Tower", "text": "Protestors sit down in the lobby of Trump Tower as New York City Police officers (NYPD) prepare to make arrests in New York City, U.S., April 13, 2017.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald J. Trump is planning to increase U.S. defense spending by $54 billion next year. But a series of recent reports by the Defense Department Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office say that Pentagon accounting systems will struggle to track how the money is spent.\n\nThe reports found that the Pentagon remains unable to accurately track its $591 billion annual budget and experiences billions of dollars in accounting gaps and errors each year despite two decades of reform efforts. Taken together, the reports show that many of the endemic accounting problems exposed in a 2013 Reuters investigative series remain in place.\n\n\u201cThese deficiencies not only affect (the Department of Defense's) ability to have auditable financial statements,\u201d a Feb. 9 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found, \u201cthey also affect its ability to make sound decisions on missions and operations.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the White House's Office of Management Budget (OMB) said he was confident that Defense Secretary James Mattis would properly spend the additional funds.\n\n\u201cThe need to replenish our military and bolster American security is unquestioned and an important priority of this president,\" OMB Communications Director John Czwartacki said in a statement. \"We believe Secretary Mattis will deploy all of his resources in the most effective and efficient way possible.\u201d\n\nCritics of wasteful Pentagon spending say increasing the Defense Department budget is unwise when the department is unable to account for what it already has.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project in Washington. \u201cReform isn\u2019t going to happen as long as the spigot is turned on.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s continued accounting problems are drawing particular scrutiny now because the Defense Department faces a congressionally mandated legal deadline of Sept. 30, 2017, to become ready for its first audit ever. Unlike every other U.S. government department, the Pentagon has never undergone an audit because its financial records are in such disarray.\n\nA spokesman for the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s office said he is confident it will meet the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe Department is committed and on track to be ready to undergo a full financial statement audit in (fiscal year) 2018,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Eric D. Badger said in an email.\n\nDEEP CUTS\n\nAt the same time Trump proposes to boost defense spending, he has called for deep cuts to other areas, a White House summary of his proposed 2018 budget shows. Whether Congress will accept or reject Trump's proposals is unclear.\n\nTrump calls for cutting the State Department\u2019s budget by $10.1 billion, or 28%. Among other things, U.S. payments to support the United Nations would be cut.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would take a particularly big hit. Trump would cut $2.6 billion, or 31%, of its budget. The White House document says the budget would eliminate more than 50 EPA programs, and cut EPA\u2019s research and development budget by $233 million, or 52%. The budget for grants to states for lead clean-up would be cut by 30% to $9.8 million.\n\nThe recent watchdog reports on the Defense Department found that it lacks a unified, functioning accounting system. As Reuters reported in its 2013 series, the Pentagon has hundreds of independent systems, built ad hoc and some dating from the 1970s, that are riddled with errors and incapable of sharing accurate data.\n\nBillions of dollars disappear from accounting records. The military has spent large sums building new systems meant to solve the problem, but so far they have not.\n\nA March 16 Defense Department Inspector General report said the Navy could not find any records to back up how it had spent $866 million in the first quarter of 2016 in U.S. military operations in Afghanistan. The report said that as a result, there was no way to know what the money actually was used for.\n\nA Navy spokeswoman, Lieutenant Kara YingLing, referred Reuters to the Navy\u2019s official response to the report, which said the Navy agreed with the Inspector General\u2019s conclusions but said its accounting problems will not be fixed until it begins using a new computer system in 2019. YingLing said the Navy is \u201con track\u201d to help the Pentagon meet its Sept. 30 audit deadline.\n\nThe Feb. 9 GAO report said the Pentagon's continued bookkeeping errors affect the federal government as a whole. Defense spending makes up such a large part of the federal budget that the department's unreliable data skews accounting for the entire U.S. government, the GAO said.\n\nSYSTEMIC RISK\n\nThe report noted that the Defense Department has been on the GAO\u2019s list of \u201cHigh Risk\u201d entities that represent threats to the federal government\u2019s financial well-being since 1995. The report said the Pentagon has remained on the list because of \u201clong-standing deficiencies with its financial management systems.\"\n\nThe GAO report noted that the Pentagon had hired large independent accounting firms for each of the military services to try to help them meet the Sept. 30 audit deadline. But the report said the firms have found so many problems that the ability of the Pentagon to meet the deadline remains in doubt.\n\nA separate Defense Department Inspector General report issued on March 23, 2017, found that the Army continues to be unable to balance its checkbook. The report concluded that the problem for the Army grew worse in 2016.\n\nThe report said that for October 2015, the Army had 177,921 discrepancies. The monthly numbers rose steadily to 790,551 for June 2016. The report did not give dollar amounts for those months.\n\nArmy spokesman Wayne Hall said the number of discrepancies continued to increase in 2017 because planned fixes to computer systems have not yet been made. He said the Army is working on building more reliable systems.\n\nThe report said that because rules require that the Army\u2019s numbers exactly match in monthly reports to the Treasury, the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must find a way to make them match. Their solution was to enter made-up numbers to make it appear falsely that the Army\u2019s numbers do match.\n\nThe report said that for March 2016, there were $1.9 billion in such \u201cforced balance entries.\u201d Hall said the Army must make the numbers match under federal rules.\n\nIn separate reports, the Inspector General found that other military services have also had problems balancing their financial numbers with the Treasury\u2019s. Accountants interviewed by Reuters said that such large discrepancies would be considered accounting fraud in the corporate world.\n\nBadger, the spokesman for the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s office, said any errors by the military services were unintentional.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose any accusation of intentionally misrepresenting our books,\u201d Badger said in an email. \u201cMany manual accounting adjustments are often caused by the ineffective design of legacy business or financial systems.\u201d\n\nTrump has said the $54 billion in increased defense spending will send a \u201cmessage to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve.\u201d Trump has also vowed to negotiate cheaper contracts with defense contractors, a problem also cited in recent watchdog reports.\n\nIn a March 2016 report, the Inspector General found that the Air Force had spent \u201cbillions\u201d on a contract to maintain one type of jet engine, without first getting any idea of a fair price.\n\nThe open-ended contract, with a guaranteed profit margin regardless of cost, was awarded in 2011. The report said that before signing the contract the Air Force obtained no data on the actual cost of the repairs and how the costs compared to private-sector rates.\n\nThe exact amount of the contract was redacted from the report. The Inspector General has not ruled on a March 2016 Freedom of Information Act request filed by Reuters that asked for the redacted information to be made public.\n\nInfographic ID: '2muNwQ4'\n\n(Editing by David Rohde.)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pentagon-idUSKBN17F1PQ"}, {"title": "Trump signs resolution allowing U.S. states to block family planning funds", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017.

Broadly, many Republicans seek to restrict abortion or make it illegal while Democrats have fought to keep abortion legal.\n\nThe resolution had narrowly passed the U.S. Congress, with Vice President Mike Pence called to the Senate on March 30 to break a tie vote in the chamber, where Republicans hold a slim majority. The federal government can never again create a \"substantially similar\" regulation under the review law.\n\nThe grants, known as \"Title X\" funds, were already barred from going directly to abortion services but under the now-null regulation Planned Parenthood clinics were assured they could receive money even in the face of state objections.\n\n\"Allowing states to withhold Title X funding from family planning clinics won\u2019t make anyone safer or healthier \u2013 it will instead place essential services out of reach,\" said Diane Horvath-Cosper, a medical doctor and fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, adding that for many people the clinics are the only place where they can receive affordable health services such as disease testing.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-abortion-idUSKBN17F2IH"}, {"title": "Trump and Yellen may not be an odd couple after all", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON At first glance, U.S. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen may have little in common.\n\nYellen is an academic economist and veteran of Democratic administrations who is committed to an open global economy, while Trump is a real estate mogul with an electoral base suspicious of the economic order Yellen helped to create.\n\nYet the two may have interests in common now that Trump is president and both want to get as many Americans working as possible.\n\nSince her appointment as Fed chair in February 2014, Yellen has kept interest rates low and she currently pledges to raise them only slowly even though unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is at its lowest in nearly ten years.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's election campaign promises to cut taxes, spend money on infrastructure and deregulate banking, have helped propel a surge in the U.S. Conference Board's consumer confidence index to its highest level since the internet stocks crash 16 years ago.\n\nFormer Fed staff and colleagues who know Yellen said Trump's surprising remarks this week in a Wall Street Journal interview, in which he did not rule out Yellen's reappointment to a new four year term next year, are not as outlandish as they may appear now that the president has a vested interest in keeping markets and the economy on an even keel.\n\nAnd the same staff and colleagues say Yellen may well accept reappointment, despite Trump's criticism of her during last year's election campaign.\n\nMany in Trump's Republican party have called for tighter monetary policy and a less activist Fed, but \"the president would not really find that useful,\" said former Fed vice chair Donald Kohn.\n\nIf Trump fills three existing Federal Reserve board vacancies with people Yellen thinks she could work with, \"it would be really difficult to turn down\" a reappointment when her term as chair expires in February 2018.\n\n\"If she continues to do well, he\u2019d be nuts to ditch her for an unknown quantity,\" said University of California, Berkeley, economics professor Andrew Rose, a long-time colleague and co-author with Yellen of an oft-cited study of labor markets.\n\nYellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground, and she has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth.\n\nIn a slow return to more normal monetary policy, Yellen has stopped the purchase of additional financial securities by the Fed and in December 2015 began raising short term interest rates for the first time in 10 years.\n\nSo far those policy shifts have been engineered with little apparent impact on job growth, and so mesh with Trump's core election campaign promises to restore employment and earnings.\n\nThe slow rise in interest rates in the past year has also happened while U.S. stock prices have risen to record highs, though Trump has claimed the credit for himself.\n\nPRECEDENT FOR FED CHAIR TO STAY ON\n\nThere is precedent for Trump to stick with a former president's Fed chair appointment. Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the three previous Fed chairs, served at least two four year terms and were nominated by both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nHowever it may be a more difficult step for Trump.\n\nDuring last year's election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then President Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican party member.\n\nIn a particularly biting moment last year, in a campaign video advertisement, he labeled her as among the \"global special interests\" who had ruined life for middle America.\n\nThe Fed on Thursday said it had no response to Trump's comments published on Wednesday on Yellen and or on whether Yellen would consider a second term.\n\nMUCH COULD STILL GO WRONG\n\nSome of Trump's advisers and some Republican lawmakers want a more conservative Fed in which the chair has less power and would see a Yellen reappointment as yet another step away from his promise to \"drain the swamp\" of the Washington establishment.\n\nThere are also three current vacancies on the Fed's seven member Board of Governors, and unorthodox new members could make it difficult for Yellen to manage policy or accept another four year term.\n\nBut if the choice is her consensus style or someone unproven in their ability to manage public and market expectations, \"he'd be wise to reappoint her,\" said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed staffer and Berkeley colleague of Yellen's currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"I don't see what is in his interests to appoint someone who is going to jack up interest rates.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider in Washington DC and Ann Saphir in San Fransisco; editing by Clive McKeef)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-yellen-analysis-idUSKBN17F2OY"}, {"title": "Trump says North Korea problem 'will be taken care of'", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump (C) arrives to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, U.S., before traveling to Palm Beach, Florida for the Good Friday holiday/Easter weekend, April 13, 2017.

At a town hall in his conservative Florida district this week, U.S. Representative Ted Yoho drew applause for defying his own Republican Party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was President Donald Trump's first major legislative initiative.\n\nFar from paying a price back home, as Trump has threatened they would, Yoho and some of the other far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two-week congressional recess.\n\nA handful of House Freedom Caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month's defeat of Trump's effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also rejected by some Republican moderates.\n\nMany supporters made clear they expect them to work with Trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation's health care system.\n\n\"I want it done,\" said Bob White, 74, after questioning Yoho on the issue during a town hall on Tuesday night in rural Putnam County, Florida. \"Wield that big stick.\"\n\nThe rebellious faction of conservatives in the House of Representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by Trump to rewrite Obamacare, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Trump has singled out the group for blame.\n\nMany caucus members refused to back the Republican leadership's bill because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. At town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs.\n\nThe reception for Yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the Republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of Congress, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at Catholic University of America, who studies congressional parties and leaders.\n\n\"The Freedom Caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents 'good job,'\" he said. \"Or if they don\u2019t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.\"\n\nMichigan Representative Justin Amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a White House adviser called on Twitter for Trump supporters to defeat him in a primary.\n\nBut in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker Kellogg Co, the four-term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan on Tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending.\n\n\"If I had to choose between Justin and Trump, I'd go with Justin for sure,\" said construction worker Eric Smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found Trump lacking conservative principles. \"At this point, I'd give Donald Trump a D.\"\n\nRetiree Cliff Ward, 72, told Amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions.\n\n\"Now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done,\" he added.\n\nGUTS TO STAND UP\n\nLiving in Georgetown, Florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, Trump voter Melvin Shebester knew little about the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe faction of small-government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream Republican leadership in the House, including an attempt to push out former Republican House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nThe 84-year-old Shebester was impressed that his congressman, Yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed.\n\n\"It takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,\" said Shebester, attending Yoho's town hall on Tuesday night at a government center in Palatka, Florida with his son and grandson.\n\n\"We can't go up there and tell Trump he's wrong,\" added his son, Steven Shebester, 56, who lives nearby.\n\nMany Republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.\n\nBut Yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. His event in Gainesville, a college town, on Monday was crowded by left-leaning activists who at times shouted him down.\n\nOn Tuesday night in Palatka, a small town in Yoho's sprawling district in north central Florida lined with oaks and Spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd.\n\nHe told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. And a phone survey of constituents found the Republican plan was as unpopular as Obamacare itself.\n\nHe said constituents gave him a clear message: \"Stay the course.\"\n\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph)\n\n(Additional reporting by Steve Friess in Michigan and Lisa Maria Garza in Texas; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-freedomcaucus-idUSKBN17F2JZ"}, {"title": "Connecticut Governor Malloy says he will not seek re-election in 2018", "text": "Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said on Thursday that he will not seek re-election in 2018, choosing to step down at the end of his second term in office.\n\n\"I will focus all my attention and energy - I will use all of my political capital from now through the end of 2018 - to continue implementing my administration's vision for a more sustainable and vibrant Connecticut economy,\" Malloy, a Democrat who served two terms as governor, said at a news conference in Hartford, the state capital.\n\nA poll released on Tuesday by Morning Consult showed that Malloy was the second-least-popular governor in the United States, with 66 percent of respondents disapproving of the job he had done.

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration, and he did it without building his wall.\n\nThe victory was announced last week by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which released figures showing a 93 percent drop since December of parents and children caught trying to cross the Mexico border illegally.\n\nIn December, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in March, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100.\n\nIt was a remarkable decline - steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions - but for eight DHS officials interviewed by Reuters it was not surprising.\n\nTrump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants. But, internally, according to the DHS officials familiar with the department's strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. This planning has not been previously reported.\n\nIn the months since Trump's inauguration, DHS has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border.\n\nThe department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border.\n\nDHS Secretary John Kelly told a Senate hearing on April 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to Trump's tough policies.\n\nTo date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration.\n\nMothers and children aren\u2019t being separated - and DHS has shelved the plan; parents haven\u2019t been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. Yet the number of migrants trying to cross \u2013 especially women and children \u2013 has dropped drastically.\n\nAsked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, DHS spokesman Jonathan Hoffman referenced the March drop, saying, \u201cThose were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment and referred Reuters to DHS.\n\nFor months, Central Americans had heard about Trump\u2019s get-tough policies. And public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. Some of the ads were funded by the United States, others by United Nations agencies and regional governments.\n\nOne radio ad in Honduras featured a mother, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a year and I don\u2019t know if she is alive or dead. I\u2019d do anything to have her here with me. Curse the day I sent her north.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Andrea Matamoros told Reuters\n\n\u201cThat worries any mother that wants to go to the United States with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans,\" she said.\n\nIDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM\n\nThe policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of Capitol Hill staffers and others called together by Trump\u2019s transition team in the weeks after the Nov. 8 election.\n\nThe group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the DHS officials and a congressional aide.\n\nOne goal was to help Trump fulfill a major campaign promise: ending so-called \u201ccatch and release,\u201d the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the United States while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved.\n\nThe group quickly identified a major obstacle - the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the DHS officials and the aide.\n\nBecause a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the Obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the United States while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. But the new administration was bound by the same court ruling.\n\nNEW ROLES\n\nAfter Kelly\u2019s confirmation as Homeland Security chief in late January, several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at DHS. Gene Hamilton, who had worked for then Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, became senior counselor to Kelly, and Dimple Shah, who had been staff director of the House National Security Subcommittee, became deputy general counsel.\n\nKathy Nuebel-Kovarik, formerly a staffer for Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, became policy chief at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Julie Kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform to become a top policy adviser at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nNone of the group's members agreed to be interviewed by Reuters. Several DHS officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants.\n\nSoon, they had the bare bones of a plan: Since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention, why not separate them from their mothers, sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers, the two DHS officials and congressional aide said.\n\nThe group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children: raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers.\n\nThe thinking was that \u201cif they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks - or even threaten to do that - they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet,\u201d said one DHS official familiar with the planning.\n\nMAKING HEADLINES\n\nOn Jan. 25, five days after taking office, Trump issued an executive order ending \"catch and release.\" (A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order.)\n\nA week later, in a town hall with U.S. Customs and Immigration Services officers, Chief Asylum Officer John Lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi-public setting for the first time, according to notes of the meeting seen by Reuters.\n\nFor more than a month after that meeting, the proposal did not leak, but after Reuters broke news of it in early March, Kelly confirmed that it was under consideration. Democratic members of Congress blasted the proposal, and within days it had made headlines across Mexico and Central America.\n\nThat month, the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one-third of what it had been in February.\n\nWhen Kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping, they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children \u2013 at least for now.\n\nAsked whether it may be revived, DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke said, \"Families caught crossing the border illegally, generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley in Washington, Gabriel Stargardter and Sofia Menchu in Mexico City, Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and Nelson Renteria in San Salvador; Editing by Sue Horton and Ross Colvin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-mothers-insight-idUSKBN17F23M"}, {"title": "Italy PM Gentiloni to fly to U.S. to meet Trump on April 20 - statement", "text": "ROME Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will fly to Washington and Ottawa meet U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in April, ahead of a Group of Seven summit in Italy the following month.\n\nGentiloni will meet Trump at the White House on April 20, and Trudeau the next day, a statement from the prime minister's office said.\n\nThe trip will allow Gentiloni to discuss the agenda of the annual Group of Seven meeting of major economies in Sicily on May 26-27, which will mark Trump's first visit to Europe since taking office.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Crispian Balmer)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-us-canada-idUSKBN17F1VI"}, {"title": "Putin told Tillerson why U.S.-Russian ties in bad state: Kremlin", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a joint news conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella after their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017.

The Kremlin had previously declined to confirm Putin would meet Tillerson, reflecting the renewed tensions.\n\nTrump had frequently called during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign for warmer ties with Putin, despite criticism from lawmakers in his own Republican Party.\n\nBut the civil war in Syria has driven a wedge between Moscow and Washington, upending what many in Russia hoped would be a transformation in relations, which reached a post-Cold War low under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nAs Tillerson sat down for talks with Lavrov on Wednesday, a volley of statements, including from a senior Russian official, appeared timed to maximize the awkwardness during the first visit to Moscow by a member of Trump's cabinet.\n\nLavrov doubled down on Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, repeating denials that Assad's government was to blame for the gas attack last week and adding a new theory that the attack may have been faked by Assad's enemies.\n\nTillerson reiterated the U.S. position that Assad must eventually relinquish power in Syria.\n\n\"We discussed our view that Russia as their closest ally in the conflict perhaps has the best means of helping Assad recognize this reality,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether Assad could be subject to war crimes charges, Tillerson said people were working to make such a case, though he cautioned doing so would require clearing a high legal hurdle.\n\nAN ICY WELCOME\n\nLavrov greeted Tillerson with unusually icy remarks, denouncing the missile strike on Syria as illegal and accusing Washington of behaving unpredictably.\n\nOne of Lavrov's deputies was even more undiplomatic.\n\n\"In general, primitiveness and loutishness are very characteristic of the current rhetoric coming out of Washington,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's state-owned RIA news agency.\n\nBut Lavrov said some progress had been made on Syria at the meeting and that a working group would be set up to examine the poor state of U.S.-Russia ties. He also said Putin had agreed to reactivate a U.S.-Russian air safety agreement over Syria that Moscow suspended after the U.S. missile strikes.\n\nTillerson noted the low level of trust between the two countries. \"The world's two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship,\" he said.\n\nMoscow's hostility to Trump administration figures is a sharp change from last year, when Putin hailed Trump as a strong figure and Russian state television was often full of effusive praise for him.\n\nIn another possible setback to a thaw with Moscow, Trump said on Wednesday that NATO is not obsolete, as he had declared during the election campaign last year. But he told a news conference at the White House with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that alliance members still need to pay their fair share for the European security umbrella.\n\nTrump said U.S. relations with Russia were not going well.\n\n\"Right now, we\u2019re not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia. This has built for a long period of time. But we\u2019re going to see what happens,\" Trump told the news conference.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said his administration's policy was not to demand Assad step down as part of a \"peaceful resolution to the conflict,\" in some contrast to Tillerson's remarks in Moscow.\n\n\"Are we insisting on it? No. But I do think it\u2019s going to happen at a certain point,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal cited Trump as saying that Assad's use of chemical weapons again would elicit another military response, but he also said he would not intervene in depth in the conflict.\n\nThe White House has accused Moscow of trying to cover up Assad's use of chemical weapons after the attack on a rebel-held Syrian town last week killed 87 people.\n\nTrump responded to the gas attack by firing 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian air base on Friday. Washington warned Moscow, and Russian troops at the base were not hit.\n\nMoscow has stood by Assad, saying the poison gas belonged to rebels, an explanation Washington dismisses as beyond credible.\n\nRussia blocked a Western effort at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday to condemn the gas attack and push Assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident.\n\nTrump came to the presidency promising greater cooperation with Russia in fighting against the two countries' common enemy in Syria, the Islamic State militant group. Tillerson is a former oil executive who was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship by Putin.\n\nTrump's relations with Russia are also a domestic issue, as U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Moscow of using computer hacking to intervene in the U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating whether any Trump campaign figures colluded with Moscow, which the White House denies.\n\n(Additional reporting by Polina Devitt, Andrew Osborn and Vladimir Soldatkin; Writing by Peter Graff, Anna Willard and Dustin Volz; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-idUSKBN17E1AF"}, {"title": "In abrupt shift, Trump warms to China and NATO, sours on Russia", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump listens during a joint news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg hold in the East Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 12, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON After less than three months in office, President Donald Trump has abruptly shifted his stance on an array of foreign policy issues from the U.S. relationship with Russia and China to the value of the NATO alliance.\n\nTrump, who ran for the White House on a pledge to shake up the status quo in Washington, repeatedly lashed out at China during the campaign, accusing Beijing of being a \"grand champion\" of currency manipulation.\n\nCandidate Trump also dismissed the NATO military alliance as obsolete and said he hoped to build warmer ties with Russia.\n\nBut at a White House news conference and in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, he offered starkly different views on those issues, saying his relationship with Moscow was souring while ties with Beijing were improving. He also lavished praise on NATO, saying it was adapting to changing global threats.\n\n\"I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete,\" Trump said as he stood at a news conference alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House East Room on Wednesday.\n\nThe reversals on Russia and NATO could reassure U.S. allies in Europe who were rattled by Trump's overtures toward Moscow during the campaign. But the president's talk of \"bonding\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping could sow confusion in Asia, where U.S. allies are fearful of a rising China.\n\nTrump's apparent shifts toward a more conventional foreign policy came amid infighting within his administration that has lately seen a decline in the influence of political operatives, mainly his chief strategist, Steve Bannon.\n\nSix months ago, candidate Trump suggested he was eager for an alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him,\" Trump said last September.\n\n\"ALL-TIME LOW\"\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Trump said he had growing concerns about Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\"We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia,\" said Trump, who ordered the firing of U.S. cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to punish Assad for suspected use of poison gas in Syria's civil war.\n\nWhile criticizing Russia on Wednesday, Trump said he and Xi had bonded during the Chinese president's visit to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where they dined together with their wives and held talks.\n\nAhead of that visit, Trump had predicted \"difficult\" discussions on trade.\n\nThe improving ties with Beijing were underscored when Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Wednesday that he would not declare China a currency manipulator as he had pledged to do on his first day in office.\n\nTrump, a former real estate developer, took office in January as a government novice whose foreign policy mantra during was a vow to keep America safe and build up the U.S. military.\n\nChristine Wormuth, former undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration, said Trump had a \u201csteep learning curve\u201d on foreign policy when he came into office but that it was beginning to even out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting to have a more nuanced and deeper understanding of a lot of issues,\u201d said Wormuth, now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe evolving Trump foreign policy appears to reflect less of the influence of his campaign team and more the views of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, all of whom are deeply skeptical of Russia.\n\nTrump' former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 for contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.\n\nThe new tone on foreign policy comes as Trump has been trying to settle the palace intrigue inside the White House, where Bannon, former chief of the conservative Breitbart News organization, has been at odds with the more mainstream Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser who is Trump's son-in-law.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post on Tuesday, Trump offered only lukewarm support for Bannon.\n\n\u201cI like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\u201d Trump said.\n\n(Editing by Caren Bohan and Yara Bayoumy)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN17F07G"}, {"title": "Russia blocks U.N.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith\n\nUNITED NATIONS Russia blocked a Western-led effort at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday to condemn last week's deadly gas attack in Syria and push Moscow's ally President Bashar al-Assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident.\n\nIt was the eighth time during Syria's six-year-old civil war that Moscow has used its veto power on the Security Council to shield Assad's government.\n\nIn the latest veto, Russia blocked a draft resolution backed by the United States, France and Britain to denounce the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun and tell Assad's government to provide access for investigators and information such as flight plans.\n\nThe toxic gas attack on April 4 prompted the United States to launch missile strikes on a Syrian air base and widened a rift between the United States and Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that trust had eroded between the two countries under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson echoed that comment after meetings with Russian leaders in Moscow, saying that relations are at a low point with a low level of trust. Tillerson called for Assad to eventually relinquish power.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called on Moscow to stop protecting Assad and said the United States wants to work with Russia toward a political solution for Syria.\n\n\"Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, including the Arab world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime,\" Haley told the 15-member Security Council.\n\n\"If the regime is innocent, as Russia claims, the information requested in this resolution would have vindicated them.\"\n\nRussia's deputy U.N. envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, said the draft resolution laid blame prior to an independent investigation.\n\n\"I'm amazed that this was the conclusion. No one has yet visited the site of the crime. How do you know that?\" he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. attack on the Syrian air base \"was carried out in violation of international norms.\"\n\nATTACK INVESTIGATION\n\nSyria's government has denied responsibility for the gas attack in a rebel-held area of northern Syria that killed at least 87 people, many of them children.\n\nA fact-finding mission from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is investigating the attack.\n\nIf it determines that chemical weapons were used, then a joint U.N./OPCW investigation will look at the incident to determine who is to blame. This team has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.\n\nChina, which has vetoed six resolutions on Syria since the civil war began, abstained from Wednesday's U.N. vote, along with Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. Ten countries voted in favor of the text, while Bolivia joined Russia in voting no.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at an event in the White House, said he was not surprised by China's abstention.\n\nBritain's U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the Security Council that samples taken from the site of the April 4 attack had been analyzed by British scientists and tested positive for the nerve gas sarin. He said Assad's government was responsible.\n\nDiplomats said that Russia has put forward a rival draft resolution that expresses concern at last week's gas attack and condemns the U.S. strike on Syria. It was unclear if Moscow planned to put the text to a vote.\n\n(Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-vote-idUSKBN17E2LK"}, {"title": "Tensions lurk behind Pence's 'partnership' visit to Indonesia", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the American Health Care Act during a visit to the Harshaw-Trane Parts and Distribution Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., March 11, 2017.

That's why we're asking them now, 'what is your policy now on the economy, on democracy, now that Trump is in power?',\" Vice President Jusuf Kalla told Reuters on March 31.\n\n\"What does it mean, 'America first'? I can say, too, 'Indonesia first' if you say 'America first'.\"\n\nIndonesia is one of 16 countries against which the United States runs a trade deficit that will be investigated by the Trump administration for possible trade abuses.\n\nTrump's combative approach will not sit easily with Indonesia, where economic nationalism and protectionist tendencies have flourished since a slump in commodity prices in recent years slammed the brakes on economic growth.\n\n\"Unfortunately I do see a hardening of attitudes on our side,\" said a senior Indonesian government official, who declined to be named. \"And it's of particular concern because we're on that list of 16 countries ... that are going to be investigated.\"\n\nThe official said a tougher stand by Indonesian authorities had also contributed to a series of disputes with U.S. companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google, miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc and financial services giant JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nA SERIES OF FACE-OFFS\n\nIndonesia has dueled with Google over back taxes and fines running into hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Freeport in a contract row that has crippled operations at the world's second-largest copper mine, Grasberg.\n\nIt also dropped JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country in November.\n\n\"It's a very unfortunate series of issues which all happen to be American,\" said the official, who expects them to come up in private during Pence's visit. Indonesia is the third stop on an April 15-25 tour that includes South Korea, Japan and Australia.\n\nGoogle declined to comment for this report, and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFreeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said: \"This visit is happening entirely independent of our current negotiations with the government of Indonesia.\"\n\nHowever, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Freeport's third-biggest shareholder and now a special adviser to Trump, has described Jakarta's tactics over the mining contract as \"disingenuous and insulting\", according to the New York Times.\n\nAnother potential irritant is biodiesel.\n\nThe U.S. National Biodiesel Board (NBB), a producer group, has petitioned the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina, claiming they have flooded the U.S. market.\n\n\"This is one of the issues that we have asked the trade ministry to bring to the meeting (with Pence),\" Paulus Tjakrawan, a director at the Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association, told Reuters.\n\n\"Our hope is for the government to be firm ... Otherwise we will be taken advantage of,\" he said. \"Not to act like thugs but, for example, if they put barriers to our exports, why not stop importing some of their goods?\"\n\nDespite the strains, the government official said Indonesia would be careful to start its relationship with the Trump administration on the right foot.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo's approach to foreign policy has been led more by economic interests than geopolitical considerations: he has pursued increased trade and investment from China but keeps a diplomatic distance from Beijing and established a strategic partnership with Washington under former President Barack Obama.\n\nU.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan Jr, said in a statement last week that Pence's visit reflected a continued commitment to that partnership, would deepen economic engagement and boost regional security cooperation.\n\n\"The U.S. embassy here certainly is going to great lengths to make the visit a success,\" said the Indonesian official. \"My impression is he's (Pence) not going to ruffle feathers in public, he's not going to cause a ruckus.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Eveline Danubrata and Fergus Jensen; Editing by Lincoln Feast)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pence-asia-indonesia-idUSKBN17F0K1"}, {"title": "Bond between Trump, Xi in meetings played role in China abstention: U.S. official", "text": "WASHINGTON A senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday that the positive bond developed between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week in Florida helped lead to China's abstention from a U.N.

Bernstein/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan's tax reform blueprint appears to be losing its status as the likely framework for the first major tax overhaul since 1986, with rival approaches emerging from the White House, Senate and other quarters in Congress.\n\nCongressional aides, lobbyists and analysts say the changing focus could delay passage of a tax bill until late 2017 or 2018, potentially foiling Republican efforts to score a legislative victory for President Donald Trump by August, following last month's failed bill to repeal and replace Obamacare health insurance.\n\nLike the healthcare bill, the House Republican tax blueprint stems from Ryan's \"A Better Way\" legislative agenda launched during the 2016 election campaign.\n\n\"The House can go and do what they want to do. We are going to formulate our own policies,\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNBC in an interview posted on the channel's website on Wednesday. \"You will have a White House, Donald Trump tax plan that we are going to take down to the Hill and try and sell.\n\nIn the meantime, Senate Republicans are expected to review a 2015 tax package from former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, as a starting point for their own tax legislation.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of conservative lawmakers that helped derail Ryan\u2019s healthcare bill, have also suggested that expanding the deficit to stave off adding new taxes could be acceptable.\n\n\"The blueprint was the Republican ideal, written as a campaign document. Now they're dealing with the realities of a closely divided Congress and a president who wants a win on this key, signature issue,\" said one business lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Ryan is not giving up on the idea of forging agreement with the White House and Senate leaders.\n\n\"Our intention has always been and continues to be to coalesce around a unified GOP plan and those conversations continue,\" said his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong.\n\nBusiness lobbyists and tax experts warn that a loss of focus could prove fatal for the tax overhaul effort, if the House blueprint disappears from the political stage.\n\n\"Right now the blueprint is the only plan we have.

Russia has blamed Syrian rebels.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS:\n\n* COMMENTARY: Why Assad used chemical weapons reut.rs/2o5FMEV\n\n* COMMENTARY: The worrying lessons of the Syria chemical attack reut.rs/2o6r55r\n\n\"It's clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there,\" one White House official said.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that the facts backed up the U.S. version of events. \"Russia is on an island when it comes to its support of Syria or its lack of, frankly, acknowledgment of what happened,\" he told reporters.\n\nHowever, at the same briefing, Spicer drew criticism after he sought to underscore the ghastliness of the gas attack by saying: \"You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\" Nazi Germany used gas chambers to kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nSpicer later apologized and said he should not have made the comparison. \"It was a mistake. I shouldn't have done it and I won't do it again,\" Spicer told CNN in an interview. \"It was inappropriate and insensitive.\"\n\nThe White House officials said Russia has frequently offered multiple, conflicting accounts of Syrian government aggression including the incident in the village of Khan Sheikhoun to sow doubt within the international community.\n\nThe United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield on Thursday to retaliate after the attack. The strikes thrust Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping told Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday that \u201cany use of chemical weapons is unacceptable\u201d and urged a political solution for Syria, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said of the telephone exchange.\n\n\"(We) must persevere with moving towards a political solution for the Syria issue. It is very important that the United Nations Security Council maintains unity on the Syria issue. (I) hope the Security Council can speak with a single voice,\" CCTV cited Xi as saying.\n\nTrump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Tuesday she thought Russia knew about the chemical attack in advance. \"They didn\u2019t look shocked. They didn\u2019t look surprised. They were so quick to defend. And then the evidence comes out, and we see exactly what it is and we know exactly what the environment was. Then you realize,\" she said on CNN.\n\nU.S. intelligence indicates that the chemical agent in the attack was delivered by Syrian Su-22 aircraft that took off from the Shayrat airfield, according to a White House report given to reporters.\n\nIn a four-page document, the White House sought to rebut many of Moscow\u2019s claims about the circumstances of the attack. It said the Syrian planes were in the vicinity of Khan Sheikhoun about 20 minutes before the attack and left shortly afterward.\n\n\"Additionally, our information indicates personnel historically associated with Syria's chemical weapons program were at Shayrat airfield in late March making preparations for an upcoming attack in northern Syria, and they were present at the airfield on the day of the attack,\" the report said.\n\nWashington wants Russia to stop supporting Assad, who has been fighting a six-year-long civil war against mostly Sunni Muslim rebels, also with the backing of Shi'ite Muslim Iran.\n\nTILLERSON MESSAGE\n\nTillerson carried a message from world powers to Moscow denouncing Russian support for Assad, as the Trump administration took on America's traditional mantle as leader of a unified West.\n\nTillerson earlier met foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies and Middle Eastern allies in Italy. They endorsed a joint call for Russia to abandon Assad.\n\n\"It is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\" Tillerson told reporters in Italy. \"We hope that the Russian government concludes that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in Bashar al-Assad.\"\n\nHe said Russia had failed in its role as sponsor of a 2013 deal in which Assad promised to give up chemical weapons.\n\nRussia says the chemicals that killed civilians last week belonged to rebels, not Assad's government, and accused the United States of an illegal aggression on a false pretext.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he believed Washington planned more missile strikes, and that rebels were planning to stage chemical weapons attacks to provoke them.\n\n\"We have information that a similar provocation is being prepared ... in other parts of Syria including in the southern Damascus suburbs where they are planning to again plant some substance and accuse the Syrian authorities of using\" chemical weapons, Putin said.\n\nTrump denied further plans in Syria.\n\n\"We're not going into Syria,\" he said in an interview with the New York Post. \"Our policy is the same; it hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re not going into Syria.\"\n\nA senior Trump administration official called Putin's remarks part of a Russian \"disinformation campaign.\"\n\nThe United States, Britain and France have proposed a revised draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council similar to a text they circulated last week pushing Syria's government to cooperate with investigators.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nThe secretary of state's role as messenger for a united G7 position is a turning point for Trump, who in the past alarmed allies by voicing skepticism about the value of U.S. support for traditional friends, while calling for closer ties with Moscow.\n\nTillerson is a former chairman of oil company Exxon Mobil Corp, which has gigantic projects in Russia. Putin awarded him Russia's \"Order of Friendship\" in 2013.\n\nHe is due to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday. The Kremlin has said Tillerson has no meeting scheduled with Putin this trip, although some Russian media have reported such a meeting could take place.\n\nWestern countries have been calling for Assad's departure since 2011, the start of a civil war that has killed at least 400,000 people and created the world's worst refugee crisis.\n\nAssad's position on the battlefield became far stronger after Russia joined the war to support him in 2015. The United States and its allies are conducting air strikes in Syria against Islamic State, but until last week Washington had avoided targeting forces of Assad's government directly.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday the United States' military policy in Syria had not changed and remains focused on defeating Islamic State.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Moscow, Ayesha Rascoe, Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali and Eric Beech in Washington; Writing by Peter Graff, Alistair Bell and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Yara Bayoumy, Will Dunham and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-foreign-syria-idUSKBN17D0GI"}, {"title": "Spicer says he let Trump down with comments comparing Assad and Hitler", "text": "WASHINGTON White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday he had let down President Donald Trump with his \"inexcusable and reprehensible\" comments comparing the use of poison gas by Syria's president to the atrocities of Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"I made a mistake.

Eighty-seven people, including children, were killed in last week's chemical weapons attack in Syria.\n\nOffered a chance to clarify his remarks during Tuesday's briefing, Spicer attempted to draw a distinction between the two different uses of deadly chemicals. Later on Tuesday, he apologized for his handling of the topic, which came on the Jewish holiday of Passover and as Christians prepare to celebrate Easter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spicer said the comments were \"inexcusable and reprehensible\" and all the more painful because they were made at a time sacred to Jews and Christians.\n\nHe said it also was disappointing from a professional standpoint, especially after what he said were \"an unbelievable couple of weeks\" of Trump's presidency.\n\nHe noted that Trump had bombed a Syrian air base in a forceful response to chemical weapons use by Assad's government and said Trump's hosting of Chinese President Xi Jinping last week had produced \"tremendous progress.\"\n\n\"Your job as the spokesperson is to help amplify the president's actions and accomplishments,\" Spicer said. \"And when you're distracting from that message of accomplishment ... it's disappointing because I think I've let the president down.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-spicer-idUSKBN17E1TP"}, {"title": "Russian diplomat says U.S. stance on Syria 'a mystery' - agencies", "text": "FILE PHOTO - Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov looks on at the start of two days of closed-door nuclear talks at the United Nations offices in Geneva October 15, 2013.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nWASHINGTON Tensions between the United States and Russia will not \"spiral out of control\" following last week's U.S. cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, describing it as a one-off response to Syria's use of banned chemical weapons.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in his biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January, ordered the strikes after concluding that Syria waged a nerve gas attack in rebel-held territory that killed 87 people, many of them children.\n\nRussia, which has advisers on the ground aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warned the U.S. strike could have serious consequences. Syria denies involvement.\n\n\"It will not spiral out of control,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\n\"I'm confident the Russians will act in their own best interest and there is nothing in their best interest to say they want this situation to go out of control.\"\n\nMattis has repeatedly warned that the U.S. military remained ready to act again should Assad use chemical weapons, saying on Tuesday that Assad would \"pay a very, very stiff price.\"\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that Trump had only authorized the single attack, meaning the U.S. military would not automatically have the authority to strike again should Washington determine another case of chemical weapons use.\n\nMattis also sought to downplay concerns about Pentagon mission creep, saying the U.S. military's focus in Syria was still fighting Islamic State militants, not becoming entangled in Syria's messy civil war between Assad and his opponents.\n\n\"The rest of the campaign stays on track exactly as it was before Assad's violation,\" Mattis said.\n\nU.S. CAN'T PROVE RUSSIA ROLE\n\nThe incident has chilled U.S. relations with Moscow after a presidential campaign during which Trump frequently called for an alliance with Russia to fight Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIt has also led the Trump administration to harden its attitude against Assad weeks after top U.S. officials said they were more concerned with defeating Islamic State militants than getting Assad out of power.\n\n\"I don't see a peaceful, stable Syria in the future that has Assad in charge,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. \"I don't see a future Syria that has (Assad) as the leader of that government.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denounced Russian support for Assad as he prepared to fly to Moscow on Tuesday.\n\n\"It is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\" Tillerson told reporters in Italy.\n\nU.S. intelligence indicates that Syrian Su-22 aircraft taking off from Shayrat airfield delivered the nerve agent sarin, according to a White House report given to reporters.\n\nMattis said there was no doubt that Damascus was responsible.\n\nAlthough some U.S. officials have strongly hinted they suspect Russia, which has a presence at Shayrat, may have known something about the planned attack, none have conclusively linked Moscow to the incident itself.\n\nMattis suggested the United States did not have firm evidence that Russia had foreknowledge or was complicit in the chemical attack.\n\n\"It was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it and beyond that we can't say right now.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON If Democrats thought it was hard to stop President Donald Trump's first U.S. Supreme Court nominee, it promises to be even tougher for them if he gets to fill another vacancy, potentially to replace the most influential justice, Anthony Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court's liberals in key cases such as on gay rights and abortion, is one of three justices 78 or older. Justice Stephen Breyer is 78 and fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84.\n\nFormer Kennedy Supreme Court clerks said the justice, who turns 81 in July, may be pondering retirement either this year or in 2018.\n\nThat would give Trump a further chance to shape the court after his first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was sworn in on Monday for the lifetime job to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after overcoming fierce Democratic opposition in the Senate confirmation process.\n\nKennedy administered Gorsuch's judicial oath at a White House ceremony, and Trump heaped praise on a justice who has spent nearly three decades on America's top court, calling him \"a great man of outstanding accomplishment.\"\n\nGorsuch is one of Kennedy former clerks. Kennedy is planning a reunion of his clerks in June rather than next year as had been expected. Kennedy, through a court spokesman, declined to comment on his plans.\n\nThe implications for the court if Kennedy were to step down are enormous. For the past decade he been its swing vote in major cases. Gorsuch's confirmation restored the court's 5-4 conservative majority. If whenever Kennedy leaves the bench he is replaced by a stalwart conservative, that would move the court further to the right.\n\nRepublicans possess a 52-48 majority in the Senate. In order to secure Gorsuch's confirmation, they voted to prohibit a procedural roadblock called a filibuster that had required a super-majority of 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominees, leaving the minority Democrats with little ammunition for the next nomination fight.\n\n\"I think it will be very hard for Democrats to get much traction to derail a future Trump nominee without the threat of a filibuster,\" George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said.\n\nBut Democrats and Republicans still are predicting a fierce fight over the next court vacancy.\n\n'I EXPECT ARMAGEDDON '\n\n\"For the life of me I don't understand why the Democrats made such a fuss about this one. They look stupid,\" Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said last week of Gorsuch's nomination. \"I expect Armageddon on the next one because that's going to change, assuming Trump gets another one, the direction of the court. It would certainly keep the court in a more conservative mode for a long time.\"\n\nA Democratic congressional aide added, \"The opposition to Gorsuch could look weak compared to what a similarly conservative nominee would face, if it would tip the balance on the court.\"\n\nKennedy is the longest-serving of the nine justices. He was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and confirmed by the Senate in 1988 after Democrats thwarted Reagan's first choice, outspoken conservative Robert Bork, and his second pick, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew from consideration.\n\nAlthough he has sided with his conservative colleagues on many issues, Kennedy has supported liberal causes such as gay rights, culminating in writing the landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nHe also joined the liberals in upholding abortion rights. In 2016, Kennedy joined the court's four liberal justices in a ruling striking down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights in more than two decades.\n\nHe also authored a 2016 ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions, joined by the court's liberals.\n\nUniversity of Georgia School of Law professor Lori Ringhand said Republicans may be wary of defending an extremely conservative court nominee with the midterm congressional elections coming up in 2018, if another vacancy arises.\n\n\"It's not clear it would be to the electoral advantage to Republicans to have a hotly contested Supreme Court nomination right before the midterms that highlighted a nominee's extremely conservative positions on social issues that the majority of the public have actually accepted,\" Ringhand said.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kennedy-idUSKBN17D2UH"}, {"title": "Trump to nominate attorney Sullivan for deputy secretary of state", "text": "WASHINGTON President Donald Trump plans to nominate attorney John J.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to make his case for increased prosecutions of illegal immigrants, pressuring U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases against criminal migrants.\n\nSessions, a long-time proponent of tougher immigration enforcement, told U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, that more illegal migrants should be prosecuted as criminals.\n\nIt is normally the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet border agents. But Sessions made the visit to highlight his focus on enforcing federal laws as dozens of U.S. cities try to shield illegal immigrants from stepped-up prosecution and deportation efforts.\n\n\"Why are we doing this?\" the former U.S. senator said. \"Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require.\"\n\nSessions said that each U.S. attorney would be required to designate a point person on border security prosecutions by April 18. The person in that position, known as a border security coordinator, would be directed to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Sessions' memo.\n\nThe directive did not go beyond existing laws, but Sessions said his order \"mandates the prioritizations of such enforcement\" by U.S. attorneys.\n\nThe Trump administration has threatened to cut off U.S. Justice Department grants to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to assist federal immigration authorities.\n\nPolice in such cities have argued that targeting illegal migrants is an improper use of law enforcement resources. Sessions has said a failure to deport aliens convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk.\n\nUnder U.S. law, anyone who harbors or transports an undocumented immigrant, has crossed the border illegally two or more times, resists an immigration officer's arrest or commits travel document fraud is subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nOther immigrants apprehended for crossing the border illegally face civil procedures, with deportation the only penalty.\n\nSessions' announcement was the latest move by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration. President Donald Trump has also called for not releasing migrants with pending court cases, targeting more people in immigration raids and building a wall on the southwest border.\n\nSpeaking just 50 yards from a border fence on the Arizona-Mexico border, Sessions said that adding more fencing to the border will be a \"force multiplier\" against illegal migration.\n\nHe also said the Justice Department plans to add 50 more immigration judges in 2017 and 75 more in 2018.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nWASHINGTON Maryland lawmakers have passed a first-in-the-nation measure that lets the state attorney general sue generic drug makers that sharply raise prices in a move aimed at fighting what legislators call \"price-gouging.\"\n\nThe bill overwhelmingly was approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature on Monday and hailed by Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh as a way to check sharply higher prices for crucial generic drugs.\n\nThe Maryland measure comes as concerns about rising U.S. drug costs have been building for years. For example the 2015 decision by Turing Pharmaceuticals to increase the cost of a life-saving, anti-infection drug by 5,000 percent sparked widespread outrage.\n\nThe legislation takes aim at a generic drug market that makes up 88 percent of U.S. pharmaceutical sales and totaled $75 billion in 2015, according to Frosh's office.\n\n\"The market seems to bear it and so some of these manufacturers are charging as much as they possibly can,\" Frosh said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\n\nGovernor Larry Hogan, a Republican, has not said whether he would sign the legislation. His representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe bill allows Maryland's state authority on Medicaid, a federal healthcare program for the poor, to let the attorney general's office know when it sees patients being charged an \"unconscionable increase\" for essential generic drugs.\n\nThe attorney general could then seek an explanation from the manufacturer and sue to protect consumers, with a fine of up to $10,000 for each violation. A judge could order the company to reverse its price increase.\n\nGenerics are pharmaceuticals that are equivalent to a brand-name drug. They usually are available after patent protections for the original maker run out.\n\nThe bill did not touch on branded prescription drugs new to the market since their manufacturers have development and patent costs they are entitled to recoup, Frosh said.\n\nMaryland is the first state to pass a measure to combat excessive price increases, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee have similar legislation pending, the conference said.\n\nThe legislation would have a \"chilling effect\" on the generic market in Maryland, said Chester Davis Jr., president of the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug makers.\n\nUse of generic drugs had saved Maryland $3.7 billion in 2015, he said.\n\n\"To focus on the side of the ecosystem that is actually driving the savings and not the costs definitely seems counterintuitive to us,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-maryland-drugs-idUSKBN17D2O6"}, {"title": "Trump says tax reform 'will be better' if Obamacare repeal passed first: Fox Business", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump arrives for the swearing in ceremony of Judge Neil Gorsuch as an Associate Supreme Court Justice in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2017.

REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's visit to Moscow this week will be an early test of whether the Trump administration can use any momentum generated by a missile attack on a Syrian air base to craft and execute a strategy to end the Syrian war.\n\nEven before Trump ordered last week's strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillerson's visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues, including Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, an apparent violation of an important arms control treaty, and seeing what cooperation, if any, is possible in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nNow, Tillerson, a former oil executive with no diplomatic experience, is charged with avoiding a major U.S. confrontation with Russia while exacting some concessions from Moscow. Those include getting rid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's remaining chemical weapons and pressing Assad to negotiate Syria's future.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Monday Tillerson was not scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit, a move that could point to tensions.\n\nIt may also suggest that Tillerson will instead follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The State Department said last week a meeting had not been confirmed with Putin, who met with Tillerson when the Texan headed Exxon Mobil.\n\nRussia, along with Iran, is Assad's primary backer, and its intervention in Syria's war has been crucial to ensuring his grip on power, although no longer over the entire country.\n\nTillerson said he had not seen hard evidence that Russia knew ahead of time about the chemical weapons attack, which killed at least 70 people, but he planned to urge Moscow to rethink its support for Assad in the April 12 talks.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that we can have constructive talks with the Russian government, with Foreign Minister Lavrov and have Russia be supportive of a process that will lead to a stable Syria,\" Tillerson told ABC's \"The Week\" on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. cruise missile strike on Thursday, meant to dissuade Assad from using chemical weapons again, gives Tillerson more credibility with Russian officials and will boost his efforts, observers and former officials said.\n\n\"The demonstration of the administration's willingness to use force has the potential to add some leverage to the diplomacy,\" said Antony Blinken, a deputy to former Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe U.S. strike - ordered less than three days after the gas attack - could make it clear to Russia that the United States will hold Moscow accountable for Assad, Blinken said.\n\nTillerson ought to be \"very matter of fact\" in his meetings, Blinken said, sending Russia a message that: \"If you don't rein him in, we will take further action.\"\n\nTillerson said on Thursday that Russia had \"failed in its responsibility\" to remove Syria's chemical weapons under a 2013 agreement, which he argued showed Russia was either complicit with the gas attacks or \"simply incompetent.\" Securing a Russian commitment on eliminating Assad's chemical weapons is likely to be first on his agenda, said Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration.\n\nRUSSIAN LEVERAGE WITH ASSAD\n\nThe talks will be a major test of Tillerson's diplomatic skills. As a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil, he has experience doing business in Russia, but no background in the often public negotiations that international diplomacy requires.\n\nIt also is unclear if Trump, who has expressed skepticism about multilateral institutions such as the European Union and United Nations, will have patience for the protracted negotiations that a comprehensive deal on Syria would require.\n\nRussia condemned the missile strike as illegal and Putin said it would harm U.S.-Russia ties. Moscow also said it would keep military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them.\n\nIt was an unforeseen turn of events for Trump, who praised Putin repeatedly during last year's election campaign and said he would like to work more closely with Russia to defeat Islamic State. Just over a week ago, top administration officials were signaling that removing Assad is no longer a U.S. priority.\n\nBut one senior official said it was significant that Russia suspended, and did not cancel, cooperation with the United States after the air strike. Nor did Lavrov cancel Tillerson's visit to Moscow, suggesting Russia may be willing to tolerate the single strike. As of this weekend, the talks were still on.\n\n\"They're going to try to draw a line around this incident,\" said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia during the George W. Bush administration. \"They are still not giving up on working with the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe Trump administration also wants to keep the focus in Syria on defeating Islamic State rather than opening a conflict with Russia or Syria's government.\n\nAnother U.S. official said one hope is that Moscow will see Tillerson's visit and a discussion about how to cooperate to stop Assad's use of banned weapons as a tacit acknowledgement of Russia's great power status, one of Putin's main ambitions.\n\n\"The strikes aren't necessarily a bad thing for Russia,\" said Andrew Tabler, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Russia's had a very hard time getting President Assad to come to the negotiating table in any kind of meaningful way.\"\n\nNow, Tabler said, the Russians can point to more U.S. strikes as the price of further intransigence by Assad.\n\n(This version of the story corrects paragraph 9 to remove sentence on Tillerson meeting with Putin on Wednesday)\n\n(Editing by John Walcott, Bill Trott and James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-tillerson-idUSKBN17C0D4"}, {"title": "U.S. judge finds Texas voter ID law was intended to discriminate", "text": "A Texas law that requires voters to show identification before casting ballots was enacted with the intent to discriminate against black and Hispanic voters, a U.S. federal judge ruled on Monday.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos came after an appeals court last year said the 2011 law had an outsized impact on minority voters. The court sent the case back to Ramos to determine if lawmakers intentionally wrote the legislation to be discriminatory.\n\nRamos said in a 10-page decision that evidence \"establishes that a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage\" of the measure.\n\n\"The terms of the bill were unduly strict,\" she added.\n\nSpokesmen for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Jr. and Governor Greg Abbott, both Republicans, could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn January, after the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Paxton said it was a common sense law to prevent voter fraud.\n\nThe ruling on voter ID comes about a month after two federal judges ruled that Texas lawmakers drew up three U.S. congressional districts to undermine the influence of Hispanic voters.\n\nThe measure requires voters to present photo identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID card.\n\nPlaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans to suppress voters who typically align with Democrats.\n\nThe legislation has been in effect since 2011 despite the legal challenges.\n\nRamos said the law had met criteria set by the U.S. Supreme Court to show intent that included its discriminatory impact, a pattern not explainable on other than racial grounds, Texas' history of discriminatory practices and the law's unusually swift passage.\n\nKristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the plaintiffs, said the ruling showed other states that discriminatory laws would not stand up to legal scrutiny.\n\n\"This is a good ruling that confirms what we have long known, that Texas' voter ID law stands as one of the most discriminatory voting restrictions of its kind,\" she said.\n\nIn a shift from its stance under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. Justice Department dropped a discrimination claim against the law in February. The department said that the state legislature was considering changing the law in ways that might correct shortcomings.\n\n(Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-texas-idUSKBN17D059"}, {"title": "Russia, before Tillerson visit, says worried USA may attack North Korea", "text": "MOSCOW Russia said it hoped forthcoming talks in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be productive, but said it was extremely worried the United States might decide to unilaterally attack North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea is emerging as one of the most pressing foreign policy problems for U.S. President Donald Trump.

Alabama Governor Robert Bentley resigned on Monday after pleading guilty to two misdemeanors related to campaign finance violations and linked to his relationship with a former adviser, ending a year-long scandal that has enveloped the state's government.\n\nThe guilty pleas were part of an agreement with prosecutors that called for him to step down, said Ellen Brooks, special prosecutor appointed by the state Attorney General Steve Marshall to investigate Bentley.\n\n\"I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama governor,\" said Bentley at a news conference in the state capital of Montgomery, adding that his service \"was a calling that God placed on my life.\"\n\nHe said he would work with his replacement, Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey, who was sworn in as governor about an hour after his resignation.\n\nIvey, a Republican, becomes the second woman to serve as Alabama's governor after Lurleen Wallace, wife of George Wallace, who served from January 1967 until her death in May 1968.\n\n\"The Ivey administration will be open, it will be transparent, and it will be honest,\" Ivey said during a short speech after her swearing in by the minister at her Montgomery Baptist church.\n\n\"What we have done today is to put an end to this administration,\" Brooks told reporters. \"It states to all of us that no one is above the law, even the governor.\"\n\nThe Alabama Ethics Commission last week found Bentley probably violated ethics and campaign finance laws after it completed an investigation into allegations that he used public funds to conceal his relationship with Rebekah Mason, a senior adviser who later resigned.\n\nIt accused Bentley of ordering law enforcement officers to track down recordings that suggested he had had an affair with Mason and accused him of retaliating against an official who discovered the relationship.\n\nBentley has denied having a physical relationship with Mason, who is married, and had repeatedly vowed not to resign, saying he had done nothing illegal. His marriage of 50 years also ended as the scandal unfolded.\n\nIn his statement on Monday, Bentley apologized for his actions, but did not mention a relationship with Mason.\n\nHe was charged with misuse of campaign funds and failure to file campaign financial reports on a timely basis.\n\nAfter his guilty pleas, an Alabama judge ordered Bentley to serve one year of unsupervised probation, make restitution and give up his retirement benefits from the state. He also agreed not to run for another political office, Brooks said.\n\nAfter Bentley agreed to the deal, the Alabama House Judiciary Committee suspended hearings which began on Monday that could have led to his impeachment.\n\nDuring the hearing, Bentley told several top aides \"what happens in the governor's office stays in the governor's office,\" Jack Sharman, the committee's counsel, said regarding allegations regarding his relationship with Mason.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Ian Simpson in Washington; writing by Frank McGurty; editing by Toni Reinhold, G Crosse and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alabama-governor-resignation-idUSKBN17C2FT"}, {"title": "May, Trump agree Russia should break ties with Assad: UK PM's office", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, October 20, 2015.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON Donald Trump reveled in the biggest political victory of his presidency at a White House ceremony on Monday in which his Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch was sworn in, poised to make an instant impact on a court once again dominated by conservatives.\n\nTrump was able to fulfill a top campaign promise when the Republican-led U.S. Senate voted to confirm the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge to the lifetime job on Friday despite vehement Democratic opposition.\n\nWith Gorsuch aboard, the court has five conservative justices and four liberals, a majority that could be pivotal in deciding a range of issues including abortion, gun control, the death penalty, presidential powers, political spending, environmental regulation and religious rights.\n\nStanding in the White House Rose Garden under bright sunshine on a warm spring day, Trump tied the occasion to the political aims of his administration, as the eight other members of the nation's highest court looked on.\n\n\"Together we are in a process of reviewing and renewing and also rebuilding our country,\" Trump told an audience that included conservative activists and administration officials. \"A new optimism is sweeping across our land and a new faith in America is filling our hearts and lifting our sights.\"\n\nGorsuch filled a vacancy that had lingered for nearly 14 months after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia's February 2016 death. Gorsuch's judicial oath was administered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom Gorsuch worked as a clerk as a young lawyer. Gorsuch becomes the first justice to serve alongside a former boss.\n\nTrump made a point of thanking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his role in winning confirmation. McConnell last week led the effort to change long-standing Senate rules in order to end a Democratic blockade of Gorsuch's nomination. Under McConnell's leadership, the Senate last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, an appointment that would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades.\n\n\"I've always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people, hopefully great people like this appointment, to the United States Supreme Court,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He will decide cases not based on his personal preferences but based on a fair and objective reading of the law,\" Trump said of Gorsuch.\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Trump pledged to pick a justice who would overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gorsuch declined to answer about whether Roe v. Wade and other important court precedents were properly decided.\n\n'FAITHFUL SERVANT'\n\n\"To the American people, I am humbled by the trust placed in me today,\" Gorsuch said, with his wife Louise and the Republican president standing behind him. \"I will never forget that to whom much is given, much will be expected.

A third concerns whether a Christian bakery owner can object on religious grounds to making a cake for a gay couple.\n\nWith Gorsuch sworn in, his new colleagues could decide to hear new arguments in their next term, starting in October, in cases argued during their current term in which they may have been split 4-4 and did not yet decide.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason, Mohammad Zargham and David Alexander; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN17C10J"}, {"title": "U.S. anti-border tax coalition to target lawmakers during Congressional recess", "text": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) arrives for a press briefing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 6, 2017.

(WBA.O) and J.C. Penny Company, are using the recess to give members of Congress behind-the-scenes tours of both their headquarters and stores in an effort to persuade them against the tax, spokesman Brian Dodge said.\n\nBoth groups are hoping to make more voters aware of their position and are armed with an opinion poll by a pollster who also works for several Republican members of Congress.\n\nThe poll, shared first with Reuters and which was conducted with funding from opponents of the tax, found 63 percent of voters are against the tax, including 70 percent of women.\n\nAdditionally, the poll makes the case that 56 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who supports the tax proposal.\n\n(Reporting by Ginger Gibson)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-lobbying-idUSKBN17C2HQ"}, {"title": "Belarus crackdown throws U.S. sanctions relief in doubt", "text": "Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko speaks during a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin following their talks at Konstantin palace in St.Petersburg, Russia April 3, 2017.

That October, President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine Belarus companies, including petrochemical conglomerate Belneftekhim and tire manufacturer Belshina.\n\nNow, however, Lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in Moscow's orbit.

REUTERS/Bita Honarvar\n\nSANDY SPRINGS, Ga. After the crushing electoral losses that swept Donald Trump into the White House and sealed Republican control of the U.S. Congress, the Democrats' road to recovery winds through the leafy, well-heeled suburbs of north Atlanta.\n\nHere, Democrats are threatening a stunning special election upset that could signal how well the party can turn Trump's low approval ratings into political gains. And they appear to have an ally in the April 18 vote: Trump himself.\n\nIn the most-watched congressional race so far in the Trump era, a wave of grassroots anti-Trump fervor has positioned Democrat Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old political newcomer, to possibly capture a House of Representatives seat held by Republicans for decades, one of 24 seats Democrats need nationwide to reclaim the House.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS:\n\nRussian naval activity in Europe exceeds Cold War levels: U.S. admiral\n\nIran chides Gulf Arabs\n\nRussian computer programmer arrested in Spain: embassy\n\n\n\n\"The grassroots intensity here is electric, and it\u2019s because folks are concerned that what is happening in Washington doesn\u2019t represent our values,\" Ossoff said in an interview. \"This is a chance for this community to stand up and make a statement about what we believe.\"\n\nWith Democrats desperate for signs of hope after Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump, Ossoff's underdog \"Make Trump Furious\" campaign has endeared him to national anti-Trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls. The documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide raised a jaw-dropping $8.3 million in the first quarter, his campaign said.\n\n\"I've never seen the Democrats around here so engaged, and it's Donald Trump who got us so engaged,\" said Carolyn Hadaway, 77, a veteran party activist and retired software engineer from Marietta, a city of about 60,000 people in Georgia\u2019s central Cobb County.\n\nGeorgia would seem an unlikely venue for a Democratic revival. Trump won it by about 5 percentage points in November. And its voters backed Republican nominees in eight of the last nine presidential contests, including the last six in a row.\n\nBut demographic changes are brewing. Growing minority communities and transplants from other regions have made Atlanta's suburbs increasingly competitive for Democrats. Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district, the location for April\u2019s special election, exemplifies changes common in booming southern cities like Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville.\n\nThe district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. It is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well-educated immigrants from India and other parts of Asia.\n\nThe district was about 80 percent white at the turn of the century. But since then, the black share of the population has grown from 10 percent to 13 percent, the Hispanic share has doubled to 12.5 percent and Asian representation doubled to more than 10 percent.\n\nAbout a fifth of the district is now foreign born \u2013 twice the statewide average, according to census data.\n\nThough newer immigrants may not be eligible to vote, census data indicate more than 40 percent are naturalized citizens, potentially bringing a different set of views on issues like immigration to the table than the voters in this district who sent Trump adviser and former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to Congress for 10 straight terms.\n\nApril\u2019s special election fills the seat vacated by Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services. It gives both parties a chance to test their messages for election battles next year in suburban districts where Democrats need to make inroads and where Trump's populist economic message did not sell well in November.\n\nWhile Price sailed to re-election with 62 percent of the vote, Trump barely beat Clinton in Georgia's sixth district by one percentage point. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney beat Democratic President Barack Obama in the district by 23 points.\n\n\u2018JUMP OVER A CLIFF\u2019\n\nRepublican candidates nationwide will closely watch the result as they calculate whether to embrace the president.\n\nThe 11 Republicans in the race have split between those who portray themselves as Trump supporters and establishment candidates who keep a respectful and sometimes wary distance.\n\n\"I'm ready to support him,\" former state senator Dan Moody, who was endorsed by U.S. Senator David Perdue, said of Trump in an interview. But \"I'm not going to jump over a cliff with him.\"\n\nGrassroots Democratic groups flood the district's tidy suburban neighborhoods on the weekends, busing in volunteers from as far away as Maryland to go door to door on Ossoff's behalf.\n\nThe Ossoff momentum worries Republicans, say party officials, and outside help has arrived. A super PAC aligned with House Republican leaders put more than $2 million into ads painting Ossoff as too young and inexperienced.\n\nOssoff played down the strategic value of a possible upset.\n\n\"The national implications here will be about how this affects the political calculus for folks in the Republican conference in the House, not about how Democrats are supposed to run in the midterms,\" he said.\n\n\u2018CONCERN, NOT PANIC\u2019\n\nIn a low turnout special election, getting supporters to the polls is vital, and Democrats have voted early in greater numbers than Republicans so far.\n\n\"We aren't panicking, but there is concern,\" said Maggie Holliman, a member of the Republican state executive committee.\n\nOssoff's best chance is to win the April 18 vote, a \"jungle primary\" that features all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. If no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote getters square off on June 20.\n\nRepublicans are confident they can win a one-on-one race with Ossoff, as the party unites with organizational and financial help pouring into the Republican-majority district.\n\n\"There is a chance Ossoff can win without a runoff, but that's his only chance. He's benefiting from unified Democratic support and Republicans being highly divided,\" said Georgia-based Republican strategist Joel McElhannon.\n\nPolls show Ossoff hovering in the low 40s, not enough to avoid a runoff. The leading Republican, former Secretary of State Karen Handel, is well behind.\n\nHandel has been cautious in talking about Trump. She said in an interview she expected to work with him on issues such as tax reform and border security, but \"first and foremost\" she would be a conservative advocate for her district.\n\nBy contrast Republicans Bob Gray, a local business executive, and Bruce LeVell, head of Trump's national diversity coalition, pledge undivided loyalty to the White House. Gray said he was the Republican in the race who performed the behind-the-scenes political groundwork for Trump in the district.\n\nLeVell pulled out his cellphone and showed a reporter text messages from Trump aides Kellyanne Conway, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and even Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to prove his insider status with the White House.\n\n\"If people are looking for someone to help Trump, I'm their guy,\" he said.\n\n(This version of the story corrects third paragraph to 'most-watched congressional race so far' from 'first congressional election')\n\n(Additional reporting by Howard Schneider in Washington; Editing by Jason Szep and Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-georgia-analysis-idUSKBN17B0E9"}, {"title": "U.S. to confront those who commit crimes against 'innocents': Tillerson", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) and Italy's Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano arrive to attend a ceremony at the Sant'Anna di Stazzema memorial, dedicated to the victims of the massacre committed in the village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema by Nazis in 1944 during World...

He has taken particular aim at renegotiating trade relationships with China and Mexico.\n\nThe new order, if issued, would seek to determine whether U.S. trade deficits for those product lines are the result of dumping of imported products below cost and unfair subsidies by foreign governments, the official said late on Sunday in Washington.\n\nThat could eventually lead to additional import duties, but any decisions on such punishments would depend on the probe's findings, not \"pre-determined conclusions,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the order was still being considered.

The political solution has to come together for the good of the people of Syria,\" she said.\n\nHer comments appeared at odds with those of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the U.S. missile strike was aimed solely at deterring the use of chemical weapons by Assad.\n\n\"There is no change to our military posture\" in Syria, Tillerson said on ABC's 'This Week' program.\n\nTillerson said the U.S. priority in Syria was defeating Islamic State, the militant group also known as ISIS. Once ISIS is defeated, the United States could turn its attention to trying to help bring about a \"political process\" that could bring about stability in Syria, he said.\n\n\"It is through that political process that we believe the Syrian people will ... be able to decide the fate of Bashar al-Assad,\" Tillerson said.\n\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any difference in nuance was inadvertent and unintentional, and declined to comment further.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than persuading Assad to step down. The Republican criticized calls by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the establishment of a no-fly zone and \"safe zones\" to protect non-combatants.\n\n\"What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,\" Trump told Reuters in an interview last October.\n\nTillerson on Sunday blamed Russia for enabling the poison gas attack by failing to follow through on a 2013 agreement to secure and destroy chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria.\n\n\"The failure related to the recent strike and the recent terrible chemical weapons attack in large measure is a failure on Russia's part to achieve its commitment to the international community,\" he added.\n\nRussia swiftly condemned last week's attack. On Sunday, a joint command center comprised of Russian, Iranian and militia forces supporting Assad said it would respond to any new aggression and increase its support for its ally.\n\nTrump ordered the missile strikes on the Syrian air base after blaming Assad for the chemical weapons attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. The Syrian government has denied it was behind the assault.\n\nSpeaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was \"prepared to do more\" regarding military action in Syria if necessary.\n\nOn whether Assad should be removed from power, McMaster said: \"We are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change.\n\n\"What we are saying is other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, 'What are we doing here?'\" McMaster said.\n\nLawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties were supportive of Trump's decision to attack the Syrian air base, but some Republican senators said they were concerned about the lack of policy clarity and Tillerson's strategy of leaving Assad's fate unresolved while concentrating on Islamic State.\n\n\"There seem to be a difference in what Ambassador Haley is saying, that Assad has no future, and what I heard this morning from Secretary Tillerson,\" Republican Senator Marco Rubio told ABC, adding that Tillerson's strategy won't work.\n\n\"There is no such thing as Assad yes, but ISIS no,\" Rubio said.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" said removing Assad from power would require the United States to commit thousands more troops to the country to create safe-haven areas for the opposition to regroup, retrain and ultimately take control of the country.\n\n\"You tell the Russians, 'If you continue to bomb the people we train, we'll shoot you down,' Graham said.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON When Donald Trump started thinking during his campaign for the presidency last year about filling a Supreme Court vacancy, he turned to a group of Washington insiders at the controls of a well-oiled machine that puts conservative judges on the bench.\n\nThat disciplined network of operatives, shepherded by judicial activist Leonard Leo, on Friday delivered for Trump his first major accomplishment as U.S. president: the confirmation of conservative Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nUnlike the chaotic rollouts of other Trump policy initiatives, the Gorsuch nomination went relatively smoothly. Democrats put up a fight in the Senate, but they lacked the votes to block the Republican majority and they lost.\n\nOther key players included experienced Washington hands such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former Senator Kelly Ayotte and White House Counsel Don McGahn.\n\n\"It worked because it was all planned out before the nomination. We know what works, what doesn't work, what resources we need. We know the other side's arguments and how to answer them. It's like war,\" Leo told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe only surprise stumble in the effort came when Trump attacked judges who blocked his order banning U.S. entry by people from certain Muslim-majority countries. Gorsuch distanced himself from the president's Twitter messages.\n\nOther than that, discipline was maintained from the first of five meetings that Leo, a veteran of Bush-era judicial confirmation battles, attended with Trump. The two met twice before the election.\n\nLeo helped compile a list of potential nominees for Trump. That helped win over conservative activists unsure of Trump's ideological compass at a time when he was still fighting for the Republican presidential nomination. A second, longer list came in September. It included Gorsuch, a federal judge.\n\nBLOCKING GARLAND\n\nThe campaign for Gorsuch's confirmation would not have happened without McConnell, who stopped former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, from filling the high court vacancy created when conservative icon Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, he named McGahn, a Washington-based campaign finance lawyer at Jones Day, as White House counsel. Known by his colleagues as \"The Quiet Man,\" McGahn managed the nomination from inside the administration.\n\nLeo, who reported to McGahn, pushed back against Democrats' claims that Trump basically out-sourced the nomination process to outside groups. Leo said McGahn carefully scrutinized the lists of nominees and was not simply a rubber stamp.\n\nThe Gorsuch campaign got heavy marketing and promotion backing from the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), a coordinating body for conservative and grassroots groups. It launched $10 million in pro-Gorsuch advertising, targeting in particular Senate Democrats facing re-election contests in 2018.\n\nThe JCN was born during the administration of former President George W. Bush, when Republicans realized a strong outside campaign was critical to getting conservatives on the court.\n\nCarrie Severino, the group\u2019s chief counsel, said the fact Trump agreed to stick to the nominees list made her job easier.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared for several possibilities, and we had ads, websites, research packets, and much more ready to launch the moment a name was confirmed,\u201d she said.\n\nLeo said conservatives have borrowed techniques from the liberal coalitions that worked to defeat the nomination of Robert Bork by Republican then-President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\nThe JCN also tapped social media and communications professionals. Washington public relations heavyweight Ron Bonjean played a role, reporting to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.\n\nAt the White House, McGahn and a team in his office held \"murder boards\" where Gorsuch was bombarded with questions senators might ask. Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short and his team organized visits with senators and worked with Ayotte.\n\nAsked to accompany Gorsuch around Capitol Hill, Ayotte accepted, she said in an interview. Ayotte had lost her re-election bid in November and had criticized Trump. But she helped arrange meetings for Gorsuch with almost 80 senators.\n\nIn the end, said sources close to the Gorsuch effort, it worked because it was highly regimented.\n\nLeo said the machine that got Gorsuch on the bench is here to stay although he will return to his job as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers' group. Leo hopes Trump will tap that machine for a possible second nomination during his presidency.\n\n\u201cSupreme Court confirmations have become full-blown political campaigns,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley, Andrew Chung, Richard Cowan and Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump-idUSKBN17938R"}, {"title": "Russia warns of serious consequences from U.S. strike in Syria", "text": "U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Porter conducts strike operations against Syria in the Mediterranean Sea.

It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.\"\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also was in Florida with Trump and is scheduled to go to Moscow next week, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the Russian reaction because it showed continued support for Assad.\n\nIran, which supports Assad and has been criticized by Trump, condemned the strike, with President Hassan Rouhani saying it would bring \"only destruction and danger to the region and the globe.\"\n\nU.S. officials called the intervention a \"one-off\" intended to deter future chemical weapons attacks and not an expansion of the U.S. role in the Syrian war.\n\nU.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support for the attack, if sometimes cautiously.\n\nThe action is likely to be interpreted as a signal to Russia, and countries such as North Korea, China and Iran where Trump has faced foreign policy tests early in his presidency, of his willingness to use force.\n\nThe United States is now likely to be more aggressive in pursuing intelligence about Syria's suspected chemical weapons program. The Pentagon has also signaled interest in determining any Russian complicity.\n\n\"At a minimum, the Russians failed to rein in the Syrian regime activity,\" a senior U.S. military official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official also said the United States had been unable to determine if a Russian or Syrian aircraft bombed a hospital that was treating victims of the chemical attack.\n\nRussia joined the war on Assad's behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. Although Moscow supports opposing sides in the war between Assad and rebels, the United States and Russia say they share a single main enemy, Islamic State.\n\nTillerson said the strike took out about 20 percent of the seventh wing of the Syrian air force and hit a fueling facility. The base's runway was still in use.\n\nAssad's office said Syria would strike its enemies harder.\n\nDamascus and Moscow denied Syrian forces were behind the gas attack but Western countries dismissed their explanation that chemicals leaked from a rebel weapons depot after an air strike.\n\nThe Syrian army said the U.S. attack killed six people and called it \"blatant aggression\" that made the United States a partner of \"terrorist groups\" including Islamic State. There was no independent confirmation of civilian casualties.\n\nU.S. lawmakers from both parties on Friday backed Trump's action but demanded he spell out a broader strategy for dealing with the conflict and consult with Congress on any further action.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council had been negotiating a resolution, proposed by the United States, France and Britain on Tuesday, to condemn the gas attack and push the Syrian government to cooperate with international investigators.\n\nRussia said the text was unacceptable and diplomats said it was unlikely to be put to a vote.\n\nMOSCOW WANTS EXPLANATION\n\nRussia expects Tillerson to explain Washington's stance when he visits Moscow next week, Interfax news agency cited a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman as saying.\n\nWashington has long backed rebels fighting Assad in a multi-sided civil war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes since 2011.\n\nThe United States has conducted air strikes against Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern and northern Syria, and a small number of U.S. troops are helping rebel militias.\n\nAsked whether the strikes set back any efforts to work with Russia to defeat Islamic State, sometimes known as ISIS, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said:\n\n\"There can be a shared commitment to defeat ISIS and also agree that you can\u2019t gas your own people.\u201d\n\nTuesday's attack was the first time since 2013 that Syria was accused of using sarin, a banned nerve agent it was meant to have given up under a Russian-brokered, U.N.-enforced deal that persuaded Obama to call off air strikes four years ago. (Chart of cumulated reported deaths from chemical gases in Syria - tmsnrt.rs/2o5Xbz6)\n\nVideo depicted limp bodies and children choking while rescuers tried to wash off the poison gas. Russian state television blamed rebels and did not show footage of victims.\n\nThe U.S. strikes cheered Assad's enemies, after months when Western powers appeared to grow increasingly resigned to his staying in power. But opposition figures said an isolated assault was far from the decisive intervention they seek.\n\nNeither the Trump administration nor its predecessor has laid out a policy aimed at ending the Syrian conflict.\n\n(Additional reporting by Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali, Roberta Rampton and Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Steve Holland in Florida, Roselle Chen in New York and Denis Pinchuk in Moscow; Writing by Alistair Bell and Bill Trott; Editing by James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKBN1782S0"}, {"title": "At U.S.-China summit, Trump presses Xi on trade, North Korea; progress cited", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping walk along the front patio of the Mar-a-Lago estate after a bilateral meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 7, 2017.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. President Donald Trump pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to curb North Korea's nuclear program and help reduce the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing in talks on Friday, even as he toned down the strident anti-China rhetoric of his election campaign.\n\nTrump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first U.S.-China summit \u2013 as did several of his top aides \u2013 but they provided few concrete specifics other than China's agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation.\n\nAs the two leaders wrapped up a Florida summit overshadowed by U.S. missile strikes in Syria overnight, Xi joined Trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nTrump's aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about China's trade practices and said there was some headway, with Xi agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing China's trade surplus with the United States.\n\nSpeaking after the two-day summit at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that Xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in North Korea's missile and nuclear programs \u2013 though he did not offer any new formula for cracking Pyongyang's defiant attitude.\n\nTrump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump is under pressure to deliver for them.\n\nThe Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi \"will be a very difficult one.\"\n\nOn Friday, the unpredictable Trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that Chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader.\n\n\"We have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China,\" Trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large U.S. and Chinese flags. \"We will be making additional progress. The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding.\n\n\"And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" he added, without providing details.\n\n\"AGREE WITH YOU 100 PERCENT\"\n\nXi also spoke in mostly positive terms.\n\n\"We have engaged in deeper understanding, and have built a trust,\" he said. \"I believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations ... For the peace and stability of the world, we will also fulfill our historical responsibility.\"\n\n\"Well, I agree with you 100 percent,\" Trump replied.\n\nChina's official Xinhua news agency said Xi had encouraged the United States to take part in the \"One Belt, One Road\" plan, Xi's signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe, seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to Asia strategy of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nXi also hailed military to military exchanges and said China and the United States should \"make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries' joint staffs of the armed forces\", although Xinhua did not give further details.\n\nChinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations.\n\nBut in a sign that rough spots remained, Tillerson afterwards described the discussions as \"very frank and candid.\"\n\n\"President Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect,\" he said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump took Xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish Spanish-style complex. Trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to Xi, who did the same.\n\nTillerson said Trump had accepted Xi's invitation to visit China and that they also agreed to upgrade a U.S.-China dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese had expressed an interest in reducing China's trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation. \"That's the first time I've heard them say that in a bilateral context,\" he said.\n\nRoss declined to say whether the United States was ready to designate China a currency manipulator, however, referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed.\n\nAlthough Trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, he has refrained from doing so.\n\nThe highly anticipated U.S.-China summit was upstaged by U.S. missile strikes overnight against a Syrian air base from which Trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week. It was the first direct U.S. assault on the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in six years of civil war.\n\nThe swift action in Syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear-armed North Korea \u2013 and by extension, its ally China \u2013 as well as other countries like Iran and Russia of Trump's willingness to use military force. North Korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the United States.\n\nTillerson said Xi agreed with Trump that North Korea's nuclear advances had reached a \"very serious stage.\"\n\nHe said Trump also raised U.S.concerns about China's activities in the South China Sea. Beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway.\n\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton and Ayesha Rascoe in Washington; and Michael Martina in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Writing by Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Leslie Adler, Richard Pullin and Michael Perry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-idUSKBN1792KA"}, {"title": "Trump ordered Syrian air strike before dinner with Xi", "text": "WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH In a secure room at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, President Donald Trump's top military advisers presented him with three options for punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a poison gas attack that killed dozens of civilians.\n\nIt was Thursday afternoon, just hours before 59 U.S. cruise missiles would rain down on a Syrian military airfield in response to what Trump had called \"a disgrace to humanity.\"\n\nTrump was at his Florida estate for his first summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But that summit took a backseat to the top-secret briefing by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, an official familiar with the briefing told Reuters.\n\nMcMaster and Mattis presented Trump with three options, which were quickly narrowed to two: bomb multiple airfields or just the Shayrat airfield near the city of Homs, where the military jet carrying the poison gas had taken off, the official said.\n\nAt least 70 people, including 20 children, were killed in the gas attack in northern Syria. Russia, which has military forces in Syria aiding Assad's government, says the deaths were caused by a gas leak from a depot where rebel groups stored chemical weapons, a charge the rebels deny and U.S. intelligence officials say is false.\n\nAfter listening to an argument that it was best to minimize both Russian and Arab casualties, the official said, Trump chose the minimum option and ordered the launch of a barrage of cruise missiles against the Shayrat air field.\n\nMattis and McMaster argued that choosing that target would draw the clearest line between Assad's use of nerve gas and the retaliatory strike, the official said.\n\nIn addition, the living quarters occupied by Russian advisers, Syrian airmen and some civilian workers were on the periphery of the airfield, which meant it could be destroyed without risking hundreds of casualties -- especially if the attack occurred outside the base's normal working hours.\n\nAnother official privy to the discussions said the administration has contingency plans for possible additional strikes as early as Friday night, depending on how Assad responds to the first attack.\n\n\"Whether this is over is up to President Assad,\" said this official. \"We have additional options ready to go.\"\n\n'DECAPITATION STRIKE'\n\nConfronting his first foreign policy crisis, Trump relied largely on seasoned military officers -- Mattis, a former Marine general, and McMaster, a U.S. Army lieutenant general -- rather than the political operatives who had dominated his policy decisions in the first weeks of his presidency, said three officials involved in the deliberations.\n\nAfter news of the gas attack first surfaced on Tuesday, Trump immediately requested a list of options to punish Assad, according to two senior officials who took part in those meetings. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and intelligence matters.\n\nSenior administration officials said they met with Trump as early as Tuesday evening and presented options including sanctions, diplomatic pressure and plans for a variety of military strikes on Syria, all of them drawn up well before he took office.\n\nThe most aggressive option on the shelf, one of the officials said, called for a \"decapitation\" strike on Assad's presidential palace, which sits alone on a hill west of downtown Damascus.\n\n\u201cHe had a lot of questions and said he wanted to think about it but he also had some points he wanted to make. He wanted the options refined,\u201d one official said.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, intelligence officials and Trump's military advisers said they were certain which Syrian air base was used to launch the chemical attack and that they had tracked the Sukhoi-22 jet that carried it out.\n\nTrump told them to focus on the military plans.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of dusting those off and adapting them for the current target set and timing,\u201d said another official.\n\n'YOU'LL SEE'\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden and said the \"unspeakable\" attack against \"even beautiful little babies\" had changed his attitude toward Assad.\n\nAsked then whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Trump replied: \"You'll see.\"\n\nAt about 3:45 p.m on Thursday afternoon, General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff called an unscheduled meeting of the service chiefs at the Pentagon to finalize the plan for the military strikes.\n\nShortly after 4 p.m., Trump signed off on the missile attacks, according to the White House.\n\nTwo U.S. warships \u2013 the USS Ross and the USS Porter \u2013 fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the targeted air base. They began landing at around 8:40 p.m. ET (00:40 GMT), just as the two presidents were finishing their meals.\n\n(Reporting by John Walcott, Steve Holland and Phil Stewart, editing by Ross Colvin and Kieran Murray)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-trump-idUSKBN1792W4"}, {"title": "Trump explained U.S. position on THAAD to Xi: South Korea", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago state in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nSEOUL U.S. President Donald Trump told South Korea on Saturday he had explained to China's President Xi Jinping America's position on the deployment of an anti-missile defense system to South Korea, according to a statement from South Korea's acting leader.\n\nTrump informed South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn in a Saturday telephone call of his summit discussion with Xi.\n\nChina has opposed the deployment of the U.S.-supplied High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea, arguing it could threaten its security, but South Korea and the United States say it is aimed at countering North Korea's missile threat.\n\nChina has increased pressure and imposed restrictions on some South Korean companies doing business in China, which led many in the South to believe Beijing was retaliating against the deployment of the missile system.\n\n\"President Trump said he and President Xi held in-depth discussions on the seriousness of North Korea's nuclear problem and how to respond to it, and also said he had conveyed the U.S. position on the THAAD deployment,\" the statement said.\n\nTrump pressed Xi to do more to curb North Korea's nuclear programme in their summit meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.\n\nThe U.S. military began deployment of the THAAD system in March, a day after the North test-fired four ballistic missiles.\n\nChina has not directly said it is targeting South Korean companies.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Ju-min Park; Editing by Michael Perry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southkorea-idUSKBN17A03E"}, {"title": "Twitter case shows breadth of U.S. power to probe anti-Trump statements", "text": "FILE PHOTO - People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2013. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK/WASHINGTON An attempt by U.S. authorities to identify an anonymous critic of President Donald Trump on Twitter has set off alarm bells among Democratic and Republican lawmakers and civil liberties advocates fearful of a crackdown on dissent.\n\nTwitter Inc on Friday succeeded in beating back a demand for records about a Twitter account called ALT Immigration (@ALT_uscis), which pokes fun at Trump's immigration policies and appears to be run by one or more federal employees.\n\nThe U.S. government withdrew an administrative summons that customs agents had sent the company in March demanding the records.\n\nBut the government backed away only after Twitter filed a federal lawsuit accusing it of violating the First Amendment's protection of free speech. Customs agents could still continue the investigation using some other methods, civil liberties attorneys said.\n\nAlthough authorities retreated, the case has laid bare the broad power of the U.S. government to demand information from technology companies, sometimes with no oversight from the courts and often with built-in secrecy provisions that prevent the public from knowing what the government is seeking.\n\nThe summons that Twitter received came from agents who investigate corruption and misconduct within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Even after it was withdrawn, some lawmakers had questions about the agency's actions.\n\n\"CBP must ensure that any properly authorized investigation does not disregard the rights to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,\" two Republican U.S. senators, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Mike Lee of Utah, wrote in a letter on Friday to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\nThe senators asked whether the agency would ever ask a private company to divulge private records about a customer based solely on \"non-criminal speech.\" Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon called for an investigation of whether customs agents had violated a law by retaliating against an internal critic.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security plans to respond directly to the senators, an official said on Friday.\n\nFORMIDABLE RANGE\n\nThere are two primary ways the U.S. government can obtain information from internet companies without a judge's approval using a law known as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to experts in privacy law.\n\nAgencies with enforcement power, such as the Internal Revenue Service, can issue administrative subpoenas demanding user records. Prosecutors can also ask grand juries investigating a crime to issue a subpoena.\n\nAn aggressive agency, for example, might demand information about a Twitter account that used an agency logo on the grounds that it is deceptive, said Georgetown University law professor Paul Ohm.\n\nSimilarly, a prosecutor could ask a grand jury to issue a subpoena based on the idea that a federal employee, suspected of criticizing the administration anonymously, was misusing government resources.\n\n\"It doesn't take a brilliant legal mind to think of hypotheticals,\" Ohm said. Further, such subpoenas are usually kept secret, making them more difficult to challenge.\n\nSome other government tools, such as a national security letter, are intended to be used for narrow purposes related to counter-terrorism investigations. But they do not require judicial approval either, instead relying on internal safeguards. Challenging such demands is difficult and often requires deep pockets, attorneys familiar with such orders said.\n\n\"It's important to keep in mind how formidable the government's range of investigatory powers is,\" said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for digital rights.\n\nIn the case of ALT Immigration, Twitter said it was not bound to keep the summons a secret, and the company informed the account holder of the government demand. That person then found legal representation with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\nEsha Bhandari, the ACLU staff attorney representing the dissident, said she thinks the speed with which the government withdrew its summons - less than a day after Twitter sued - means the customs agents will cease investigating, but she cannot be sure.\n\n\"It's impossible to predict, of course, but I'm hopeful that this really is a recognition that people have the ability to speak online including in ways that are critical of the government,\" Bhandari said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not said what its plans are for the investigation.\n\nAfter Trump's inauguration in January, anonymous Twitter feeds that borrowed the names and logos of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies appeared to challenge the president's views on climate change and other issues.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK Internal State Department instructions to implement President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority nations help demonstrate that the ban violates the constitution, the American Civil Liberties Union argued in court filings late on Thursday.\n\nThe ACLU made the argument as part of its lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California on behalf of three student visa holders against Trump's March 6 executive order barring travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and refugees for four months. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, says the order discriminates against Muslims.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson issued instructions to implement Trump's order in a series of four cables to consular officers worldwide last month, which were first revealed by Reuters.\n\nThe ACLU pointed to language from one of the cables that directs consular officers to assess whether applicants from the six countries \"found otherwise eligible\" for U.S. visas could still be denied visas based on Trump's order. The ACLU said the guidance \"amounts to an unconstitutional amendment of existing law.\"\n\nTillerson issued the cable on March 10, and followed it with another set of instructions on March 15, the day before the ban was supposed to go into effect. After federal courts blocked the central tenets of Trump's order, Tillerson issued two other cables that rescinded many of his previous instructions but left some tighter visa vetting procedures in place.\n\nA State Department official declined to comment on the litigation or the cables. The Department of Justice also declined to comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that the travel ban and increased screening of foreigners are crucial to protecting the United States from terrorist attacks. The government is arguing in court that the president has broad authority under the law to make immigration decisions when there are concerns about national security.\n\nThe March executive order replaced a more sweeping travel ban that Trump signed on Jan. 27, which sparked chaos and protests at airports and was challenged by more than two dozen lawsuits. The original ban had covered citizens of Iraq, as well as the six countries also included in the revised ban. Iraq was dropped from the revised order, as was an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.\n\nThe revised ban aimed to overcome legal hurdles by excluding legal permanent residents and allowing for waivers for people with ties to the United States. The ACLU, in its claims that the order discriminates against Muslims, points to calls by Trump on the campaign trail for a \"Muslim ban\" and to a speech he made last month calling the new ban a \"watered-down\" version of the first.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-cables-idUSKBN17930K"}, {"title": "Alabama court allows release of evidence against governor", "text": "An Alabama state court on Friday rejected Governor Robert Bentley's request to block a legislative committee from releasing evidence about wrongdoing stemming from his relationship with a former aide to be used for impeachment proceedings.\n\nA Montgomery County State Court judge was still hearing arguments on Friday evening over the governor's motion to halt impeachment proceedings in the Alabama House of Representatives.

Ford Williams/Courtesy U.S. Navy\n\nNEW YORK/FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. For many supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, his decision to bomb a Syrian airfield in retaliation for a poison gas attack was a decisive show of strength and resolve - just what they voted for in November.\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen Trump voters, many acknowledged that getting the U.S. military directly involved in the Syrian conflict was a far cry from the \"America First\" isolationism the Republican candidate espoused during the campaign.\n\nUnlike several prominent far-right backers who denounced Thursday's air strikes in Syria , most of the Trump voters interviewed in Texas, Florida and New York on Friday said the attack was not an abdication of his commitment to put U.S. interests above all others.\n\n\"Love it, love it, love it, love it. He said from Day One that he's not going to take any nonsense,\" Anthony Calvanese, 28, a construction foreman, told a reporter on a sidewalk in New York City's Staten Island borough. \"He needs to start showing our superiority in the world.\"\n\nTrump's order came despite his vow in the 2016 campaign to avoid entanglements in Middle East conflicts. Four years ago, he also admonished his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, to refrain from retaliating after the Syrian government launched a poison gas attack on its own citizens.\n\nThe apparent ideological inconsistencies angered some of Trump's staunchest supporters on the far right.\n\nPaul Joseph Watson, a London-based editor at Infowars, a U.S. media outlet praised by Trump that promotes unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, declared on Twitter he was \"OFF the Trump train.\"\n\nSelf-described white nationalist leader Richard Spencer called Trump's decision a \"betrayal\" and the \"end of America First.\"\n\nBy contrast, several Trump voters said they still trusted the president to deliver on his promises.\n\nTodd Recknagel, a 53-year-old managing partner of a private equity firm in Panama City Beach, Florida, said the move reinforced his support for Trump because it showed the president is willing to adjust his thinking based on events.\n\n\"I appreciate the fact that he's not so inwardly focused that he's willing to stand up for principle on something like Syria,\" he said in a phone interview.\n\n\"(Ronald) Reagan wouldn't allow that stuff either,\" he said, referring to the 1980s president revered by Republicans.\n\nSome Trump backers said he had no choice but to act given the horror of Tuesday's poison gas attack.\n\n\"If we allowed this to go by, we would be as bad as those who stood by and did nothing as Hitler marched across Europe\" in World War 2, Tom Harney, 64, a yacht broker from Lauderhill, Florida, said outside a diner in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Joseph Mure Jr., a lawyer who practices in Brooklyn.\n\n\"They murdered innocents: women, babies, children,\" he told a reporter after exiting a Staten Island courthouse. \"How many bombs did we drop on Syria? I wish we'd dropped twice that amount.\" U.S. warships in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at the airfield.\n\nOthers said Trump, who cultivated a tough image during the campaign and promised to strengthen the American military, was demonstrating that the United States remains the world's leader.\n\n\"We're no longer leading from behind,\" said Art Tillberg, 67, of Coral Springs, Florida, referring to a phrase Republicans used to criticize Obama's 2011 efforts to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nStill, not all Trump voters agreed with the missile strike, echoing objections from some on the far right that it ran counter to his campaign promises.\n\nAnthony Sage, a 42-year-old retired Army staff sergeant, said the attack undermined Trump's \"America First\" message.\n\n\"The strike is a waste of American time and money,\" Sage, who said he served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, said on Friday outside the Fort Hood Army base in Killeen, Texas. \"We should be taking care of people here in America first.\"\n\nAbdi Mohamed, a 23-year-old Somali immigrant from St. Paul, Minnesota, who voted for Trump in November, said the move showed the president was abandoning his outsider instincts in favor of following the advice of the political establishment.\n\n\"He was against military action in Syria, but now it seems more and more he is becoming a bit of a cog in the system,\" Mohamed said in a phone interview.\n\nA few Trump voters found themselves torn: wary of the decision to embroil the United States in Syria's six-year civil war but unwilling to abandon the president they elected.\n\n\"I'm kind of on the fence,\" said Melanie Groves, 39, a small business owner in Louisville, Illinois, who organized a pro-Trump rally last month.\n\n\"Best-case scenario, this would be a strong message that this red line has been crossed,\" she said in a phone interview. \"Worst-case scenario, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists that think we are headed towards World War 3.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Killeen, Texas, Timothy McLaughlin in Chicago and Heide Brandes in Oklahoma City; Writing by Joseph Ax; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-voters-idUSKBN17934M"}, {"title": "Highlights: The Trump presidency on April 7 at 7:00 p.m. EDT", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner in Washington, U.S., March 21, 2017.

The Washington-based group advocates \"a free, democratic, and pluralistic Syria through American support.\"\n\nU.S. officials said the air base targeted on Thursday was the launching point for Tuesday's poison gas attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children.\n\nSome Syrian-Americans and Syrians in the United States said Trump's response to the chemical attack transformed him in their eyes.\n\n\"A lot of Syrian-Americans are now cheering the president, are elated,\" said Dr. Mohammad Kabbesh, 45, a physician who grew up in Damascus but now lives in Sacramento, California, said by phone.\n\nSyrian refugee Motaz al Afandi, 49, of Texas said that if Trump pursues aggressive action toward Assad, he could end up solving the refugee problem.\n\n\"If we get rid of Al-Assad, we won't need to be refugees anymore,\" said al Afandi, who runs a tow truck business in the Dallas area and sought asylum in the United States with his wife and three children after fleeing his country's conflict.\n\nStill, some who cheered the military action said the travel ban first launched in January had left them with mixed feelings about Trump, and they reserved judgment as they awaited his next steps.\n\n\"We're partway there,\" said Youmun Alhlou, 23, of San Jose, California, who works as a legal specialist at Google and whose parents immigrated to the United States from Syria.\n\nOthers questioned whether the White House was using the humanitarian crisis as an excuse for more overseas wars.\n\n\"It's part of the plan to invade more countries for various reasons, whether its oil or power,\" said Amir Alshakarna, 31, of Southfield, Michigan, who became an American citizen last year and works for his family's construction company.\n\n\"The Trump who did the travel ban, that's the real Trump.\"\n\nAsghar of Dearborn said Trump could be using military might to distract from the stumbles seen during his first months in office.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it is suspending enforcement of the costliest requirements of its \"conflict minerals\" rule, after a court remanded it back to the regulator because part of it violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nActing SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar, a Republican, said he has asked staff for a recommendation on how to proceed with the rule, which requires companies to disclose if their products contain certain minerals from a war-torn part of Africa.\n\nFor now, he added, companies will not be required to conduct a due diligence review or an audit, which are both part of the process used to determine the origin of the minerals.\n\n\"Until these issues are resolved, it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance that would counsel in favor of enforcing\" the due diligence requirements, he said in a statement.\n\nThe move sparked backlash from SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein, who accused Piwowar of acting beyond his authority to gut the meat of a rule mandated by Congress, adopted by the SEC and reviewed by the courts.\n\n\u201cIt is unprecedented for one commissioner, acting alone and without official notice and comment, to engage in de facto rulemaking,\" she said.\n\n\"It represents a troubling attack not only on the Commission process, but also on the restraints of government power.\u201d\n\nThe conflict minerals rule was required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and is supported by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the hope that such disclosures will curb funding to armed groups.\n\nBusiness groups have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain.\n\nIn 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over it.\n\nThe court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free.\n\nThe rest of the rule was left intact.\n\nSince then, companies have furnished reports with SEC and conducted due diligence, though they were granted a reprieve from the audit requirement and the labeling of the minerals themselves.\n\nThe litigation formally came to an end on Monday, when the lower court remanded the rule back to the SEC to address the First Amendment concerns.\n\nThe appeals court did not say whether the Dodd-Frank law itself or the SEC's implementation of the rule violated the Constitution, a matter that the SEC will now need to determine.\n\nCompanies will still need to file required forms with the SEC and do origin inquiries, as they have been doing.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nSupreme Court nominee judge Neil Gorsuch is sworn in to testify at his confirmation hearing. REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan\n\nWASHINGTON The Republican-led Senate on Friday gave Donald Trump the biggest triumph of his young presidency, confirming his Supreme Court nominee over stout Democratic opposition and restoring a conservative majority on the highest U.S. judicial body.\n\nThe Senate, which last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court, voted 54-45 to approve Republican Trump's pick, Colorado-based federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, to the lifetime job. Three Democrats joined the Republicans in voting for Gorsuch.\n\nGorsuch's confirmation ends the longest Supreme Court vacancy since 1862 during the American Civil War, with the court down a justice for almost 14 months since long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016.\n\n\"Judge Gorsuch's confirmation process was one of the most transparent and accessible in history, and his judicial temperament, exceptional intellect, unparalleled integrity and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the nation's highest court,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\n\"He's going to make an incredible addition to the court,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor.\n\nIllustrating the importance of the moment, Vice President Mike Pence served as the Senate's presiding officer during the vote to confirm Gorsuch, who also worked in Republican former President George W. Bush's Justice Department and is the son of the first woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nRepublicans, possessing a 52-48 Senate majority, on Thursday overcame a ferocious Democratic effort to block a confirmation vote, resorting to a rule change known as the \"nuclear option.\"\n\n\"Today, for the first time in history, the theft of a Supreme Court seat has been completed, profoundly damaging the integrity of the court,\" said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, referring to Republicans casting aside Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, who would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades.\n\nMerkley this week delivered a 15-1/2-hour Senate speech against Gorsuch.\n\nThe Senate's approval of Gorsuch reinstates the nine-seat court's 5-4 conservative majority, fulfilling an important Trump campaign promise.\n\nGorsuch, 49, was the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 picked Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time. Gorsuch could be expected to serve for decades, while Trump could make further appointments to the high court to make it even more solidly conservative because three of the eight justices are 78 or older.\n\nThree Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp - voted for Gorsuch. Republican Senator Johnny Isakson missed the vote while recovering from back surgery.\n\nGorsuch's confirmation gave a boost to Trump, showing he can get important agenda items through a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans after the House of Representatives last month failed to pass healthcare overhaul legislation. Trump is planning major tax cut legislation as well.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY STEPS\n\nSenate Republicans resorted to extraordinary steps to overcome Democratic opposition to Gorsuch, including changing long-standing Senate rules to prohibit the use of a procedural blockade called a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The rule change was dubbed the \"nuclear option\" because it was considered an extreme break from Senate tradition.\n\nDemocrats accused Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump.\n\nGorsuch joins fellow conservatives Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy on a court that also includes liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nTrump has recorded accomplishments since taking office on Jan. 20, including a variety of unilateral executive actions such as moving to undo Obama's climate change regulations.\n\nBut he has encountered trouble with other major initiatives. Courts blocked his executive action to stop people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. His administration also has faced questions about any role the president's associates may have played in alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump.\n\nThe rule change could make it easier for Trump to win confirmation of Supreme Court nominees as long as Republicans control the Senate, with Democrats left powerless to resist even if he gets a chance to replace the court's senior liberal, 84-year-old Ginsburg, or the court's swing vote, 80-year-old Kennedy, with more conservative replacements.\n\nA conservative-majority court is more likely to support gun rights, abortion regulations, an expansive view of religious liberty and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years.\n\nAmong the groups congratulating Gorsuch on his confirmation were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group, the National Rifle Association gun rights group and anti-abortion activists.\n\nGorsuch will be sworn in on Monday in two different ceremonies, one at the court and one at the White House. He can then prepare for the court's next round of oral arguments, starting on April 17. The court's current term ends in June.\n\nGorsuch will participate in the justices' private April 13 conference to consider taking new cases. There are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public, state voting restrictions that critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout, and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to providing gay couples certain services.\n\nOn April 19, the court will hear a case in which a church contends Missouri violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Gorsuch has ruled in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley, Andrew Chung and Richard Cowan; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1791GR"}, {"title": "U.S. net neutrality advocates blast Pai effort to reverse rules", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Ajit Pai, Chairman of U.S Federal Communications Commission, delivers his keynote speech at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 28, 2017.

It was certainly more than a pinprick, and sends a message ... that using chemical weapons again is not something (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad) can do with impunity,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference.\n\nMcConnell said Vice President Mike Pence had called him to explain the rationale for the strikes. It was one of a series of calls by administration officials to members of Congress beginning shortly before the strikes and extending until after midnight on Thursday evening.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was called by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump himself.

In 2013, then-President Barack Obama ran into stiff resistance from many Republicans, including McConnell, when he proposed military action to retaliate for a chemical attack that crossed Obama's red line.\n\nMany Democrats, some of whom had paid a political penalty for backing Republican President George W. Bush's war in Iraq, also opposed intervention.\n\nObama's abrupt decision not to fire missiles and instead work with Russia to remove Assad's chemical weapons infuriated many Republicans who had backed the Democratic president's proposal.\n\nThe conflict in Syria has now dragged on for seven years, devastating the country, destabilizing the region and leaving millions homeless.\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said he wanted a broader strategy. \"I would love to have one yesterday, or the day before. I'd like to have one already but I'd rather them design it correctly than not,\" he said, leaving a briefing by General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMost lawmakers insisted Trump should seek Congress' approval for any additional military action.\n\n\"Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation,\" Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan to call the House of Representatives back to Washington to debate a formal authorization to use military force.\n\nThe House is not due to return until late April.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, called the Syria strikes illegal. Under the U.S. Constitution, declarations of war require congressional approval. \"We've had no chance to weigh or weigh in on whether we should do it or not,\" Paul told reporters.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy, another committee member, said that if Congress does not assert itself now, it risked losing its constitutional right to declare war.\n\n\"I think it's devastating to the future role of Congress in foreign affairs. If we don't authorize this action, I don't see why any president would ever come to Congress,\" Murphy said.\n\n(Reporting by David Alexander, Eric Walsh and Warren Strobel; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-congress-idUSKBN17922M"}, {"title": "Concerned about White House infighting, Trump eyes shake-up: WSJ", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers a statement at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 6, 2017.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged cooperation with the United States on trade and investment on Thursday, inviting President Donald Trump to visit China in a cordial start to their first meeting likely to broach sensitive security and commercial issues.\n\nTrump has said he wants to raise concerns about China's trade practices and press Xi to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions during his two-day visit to the Spanish-style Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, though no major deals on either issue are expected.\n\nThe two sides should promote the \"healthy development of bilateral trade and investment\" and advance talks on a bilateral investment agreement, Xi said, according to a statement on China's Foreign Ministry website.\n\n\"We have a thousand reasons to get China-U.S. relations right, and not one reason to spoil the China-U.S. relationship,\" Xi told Trump.\n\nTrump accepted Xi's invitation to China later this year, state news agency Xinhua news agency cited officials as saying on Friday.\n\nXi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, joined Trump and his wife, Melania, at a long table in an ornate candle-lit private dining room festooned with red and yellow floral centerpieces, where they dined on pan-seared Dover sole and New York strip steak.\n\nTrump, a New York real estate magnate before he ran for office, joked before dinner: \"We've had a long discussion already, and so far I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing. But we have developed a friendship - I can see that - and I think long term we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it.\"\n\nThe fanfare over the summit on Thursday was overshadowed by another pressing foreign policy issue: the U.S. response to a deadly poison gas attack in Syria. As Trump and Xi were wrapping up dinner, U.S. forces fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase from which it said the chemical weapons attack was launched this week, an escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria that swiftly drew sharp criticism from Russia.\n\nIn Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry urged all parties in Syria to find a political settlement.\n\nTrump and Xi were expected to get into more detailed discussions about trade and foreign policy issues on Friday, concluding their summit with a working lunch.\n\nTrump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China and rebuild the country's manufacturing base. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory in November and Trump wants to deliver for them.\n\n\"We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years. That's one of the things we are going to be talking about,\" Trump told reporters ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe bilateral investment treaty mentioned by Xi, talks on which began during former president George W. Bush's administration and resumed under Barack Obama, has received little attention since Trump took office.\n\nTrump is still finding his footing in the White House and has yet to spell out a strategy for what his advisers called a trade relationship based on \"the principle of reciprocity.\"\n\nHe brought his top economic and national advisers to Florida for the meeting, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\n\"Even as we share a desire to work together, the United States does recognize the challenges China can present to American interests,\" said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, also in Florida for the meeting.\n\nTrump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both work at the White House, also were among the dinner guests.\n\nDIFFERING PERSONALITIES\n\nThe summit brings together two leaders who could not seem more different: the often stormy Trump, prone to angry tweets, and Xi, outwardly calm, measured and tightly scripted, with no known social media presence.\n\nWhat worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.\n\n\"Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,\" a Chinese official said.\n\nThe most urgent problem facing Trump and Xi is how to persuade nuclear-armed North Korea to halt unpredictable behavior like missile test launches that have heightened tensions in South Korea and Japan.\n\nNorth Korea is working to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States.\n\nTrump has threatened to use trade to try to force China to exert influence over Pyongyang.\n\n\"I think China will be stepping up,\" Trump told reporters on Thursday. Beijing says its influence is limited and that it is doing all it can.\n\nThe White House is reviewing options to pressure Pyongyang economically and militarily, including \"secondary sanctions\" against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.\n\nA long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but despite the tougher recent U.S. talk, the internal review \"de-emphasizes direct military action,\" the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnalysts believe any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops stationed there.\n\nNO GRAND BARGAIN ON TRADE\n\nOn trade, U.S. labor leaders say Trump needs to take a direct, unambiguous tone in his talks with Xi.\n\n\"President Trump needs to come away from the meeting with concrete deliverables that will restore production and employment here in the U.S. in those sectors that have been ravaged by China's predatory and protectionist practices,\" said Holly Hart, legislative director for the United Steelworkers union.\n\nA U.S. administration official told Reuters that Washington expects to have to use legal tools to fight for U.S. companies, such as pursuing World Trade Organization lawsuits.\n\n\"I don't expect a grand bargain on trade. I think what you are going to see is that the president makes very clear to Xi and publicly what we expect on trade,\" a U.S. official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump has often complained Beijing undervalues its currency to boost trade, but his administration looks unlikely to formally label China a currency manipulator in the near term - a designation that could come with penalties.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, Roberta Rampton, Ayesha Rascoe and Mohammad Zargham in Washington, Gui Qing Koh in New York, Michael Martina in Beijing and William Mallard in Tokyo; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, James Dalgleish and Nick Macfie)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-idUSKBN17815O"}, {"title": "Trump says progress made in U.S.-China relations during Xi visit", "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla.

I REUTERS/KCNA\n\nPresident Donald Trump faces his biggest test as a world leader when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday and Friday for a summit that will set the tone for perhaps the most consequential of U.S. foreign relationships.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to struggle to find common ground on the main issues that divide them when they meet at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe main agenda items are:\n\nNORTH KOREA\n\nNorth Korea is perhaps Trump's most pressing national security challenge. Pyongyang has been working to develop nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Trump is expected to repeat his call for China to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor and has warned that Washington might deal with Pyongyang's weapons programs alone if need be.\n\nChina says it is doing all it can and has said it is up to the United States to de-escalate with Pyongyang.\n\nA White House strategy review focuses on options for pressuring Pyongyang economically and militarily. Among measures under consideration are \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.\n\nA long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but the review \u201cde-emphasizes direct military action,\u201d a senior U.S. official said. Any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops stationed there. TRADE\n\nTrade is one of the biggest hot-button issues, given Trump\u2019s charges in his presidential campaign that Chinese trade practices were killing U.S. jobs and his vow to impose 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe administration has not acted on unilateral tariffs but is targeting a reduction in China's $347 billion goods trade surplus through tougher enforcement of trade laws and anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has also demanded \"reciprocity\" in the U.S.-China economic relationship, saying that U.S. companies do not enjoy the same access to China's vast market as Chinese firms get in the United States.\n\nChina says Washington should create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States if it wants to correct the imbalance.\n\nNeither side wants a trade war, but it may be hard to do much more than lower the temperature in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSome analysts believe Xi may bring a package of job-creating Chinese investments and the prospect of a more open services sector that Trump could tweet as tangible achievements.\n\nSOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nRelations are also clouded by China's expansive claims in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing has been building artificial islands and installing military facilities on them.\n\nU.S. officials see this as part of a long-term Chinese bid to deny U.S. forces access to the strategic sea, a key global trade route.\n\nThey say Washington plans more robust naval operations to challenge Chinese claims and assert the right to freedom of navigation, though months have passed since the last one in October under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nThe situation in North Korea has appeared to push the South China Sea issue onto the back burner for now, but Trump is expected to air U.S. concerns.\n\nCURRENCY\n\nTrump has repeatedly charged that China manipulates its yuan currency to keep its exports cheap, and he is likely to raise the issue with Xi. But Trump did not make good on his promises to formally declare China a currency manipulator on the first day of his presidency.\n\nWhile economists believe China pushed down the value of the yuan in the past, China's central bank for much of the past two years has been working to prop up the yuan amid capital outflow pressures, spending more than $1 trillion in the process.\n\nThis would make it very hard to justify a manipulator designation under the U.S. Treasury's current foreign exchange analysis, due one week after Xi's visit.\n\n\u201cONE CHINA\u201d AND TAIWAN\n\nThe summit would not be happening if Trump had not reaffirmed the \u201cone China\" policy that has underpinned bilateral relations for decades. Trump infuriated Beijing when, as president-elect, he took a call from Taiwan\u2019s president and suggested he might not abide by the policy. He backtracked in a call with Xi in February.\n\nXi may now be looking to head off a big new weapons package to Taiwan that U.S. officials have told Reuters is being crafted.\n\nFor its part, Taiwan will be watching anxiously for any sign that Trump is using it as a bargaining chip.\n\n(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick, David Brunnstrom and David Lawder; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-differences-factbox-idUSKBN178255"}, {"title": "Trump says ready to act alone on North Korea", "text": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would be ready to act unilaterally to address North Korea's nuclear program if China does not step up to help with the matter.\n\n\"Certainly I would be,\" Trump told reporters when asked whether he would be willing act alone on North Korea. \"But I think China will want to be stepping up.\"\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-northkorea-idUSKBN1782ME"}, {"title": "Is the sky blue? Depends on what Donald Trump says", "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Republicans generally agree that politicians should not enrich themselves while running the country. Yet most think it is okay for President Donald Trump to do so.\n\nDemocrats largely support the idea of government-run healthcare. But their support plummets when they learn that Trump once backed the idea.\n\nAt a time of already deep fissures among American voters on political, cultural and economic issues, Trump further polarizes the public as soon as he wades into the debate, according to the results of a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The poll suggests any effort to reach a consensus on key policy issues could be complicated simply by Trump's involvement.\n\nThe survey from Feb. 1 to March 15 of nearly 14,000 people asked respondents to consider a series of statements Trump has made on taxes, crime and the news media, among other issues. In many cases, the data showed that people will orient their opinions according to what they think of Trump.\n\nRepublicans, for example, were more likely to criticize American exceptionalism \u2013 the notion that the United States holds a unique place in history - when told that Trump once said it was insulting to other countries. They were more likely to agree that the country should install more nuclear weapons, and they were more supportive of government spending for infrastructure, when they knew that Trump felt the same way.\n\nDemocrats moved in the opposite direction. They were less supportive of infrastructure spending, less critical of the judiciary and less likely to agree that urban crime was on the rise when they knew that those concerns were shared by Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically in disagreement with everything he says,\u201d said Howard House, 58, a Democrat from Jacksonville, Florida, who took the poll. \u201cI\u2019ve almost closed my mind to the guy.\u201d\n\nTrump is not the first president to polarize the public. A 1995 poll by the Washington Post found that Democrats appeared to favor legislative action when they thought it was then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s idea, and a 2013 survey by Hart Research Associates showed that both positive and negative attitudes about the 2010 Affordable Care Act intensified when called by its other name, Obamacare.\n\nBut previous presidents were more popular than Trump at this point, according to the Gallup polling service, and they may have been better positioned to address the public divide because of it. Gallup had Trump at a 42 percent approval rating on Tuesday. He was as low as 35 percent last week.\n\nThat leaves Trump facing a largely disapproving electorate, even as the White House signals that in the coming months it wants to pass a sweeping tax-reform package, a large infrastructure plan, and perhaps try again to supplant the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe White House said that Trump has tried to reach out to those who did not support him during the campaign in an attempt to build political consensus.\n\n\u201cThe door to the White House has been open to a variety of people who are willing to come to the table and have honest discussions with the President about the ways we can make our country better,\u201d a White House spokeswoman wrote in an email.\n\nTHE HYPER-PARTISAN ERA OF TRUMP\n\nInfographic ID: '2p4Ma04'\n\nPoll respondents were split into two groups. Each received nearly identical questions about statements Trump has made in recent years. One group, however, was not told the statements came from Trump.\n\nThe poll then asked if people agreed or disagreed with those statements. In a few cases, Trump made little to no impact on the answers. But most of the time the inclusion of his name changed the results.\n\nA series of questions about conflicts of interest produced the biggest swings.\n\nSome 33 percent of Republicans said it was okay if \u201can official\u201d financially benefits from a government position. However, when a separate group was asked the same question with Trump\u2019s name added in, more than twice as many Republicans \u2013 70 percent \u2013 said it was okay.\n\nWhen interviewed afterward, some respondents said they knew they were making special exceptions for Trump.\n\nSusie Stewart, a 73-year-old healthcare worker from Fort Worth, Texas, said it came down to trust. While most politicians should be forbidden from mixing their personal fortunes with government business, Stewart, who voted for Trump, said the president had earned the right to do so.\n\n\"He is a very intelligent man,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHe\u2019s proved himself to be one hell of a manager. A builder. I think he has the business sense to do what\u2019s best for the country.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, House, the Democrat from Florida and a Hillary Clinton supporter, said he also made an exception for Trump.

Instead, she could only request it to do so.\n\nSuch requests, which a number of senior officials are authorized to make, trigger a legal and intelligence review by the agency to determine whether revealing the name has potential intelligence value and could expose a security threat to the United States, said one of the officials, who is familiar with the process and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal intelligence procedures.\n\nThere is nothing unusual, much less suspicious, about any request by Rice, said another intelligence official, especially since it could have revealed Russian intelligence contacts or agents operating in the United States.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON Senate Republicans on Thursday crushed a Democratic blockade of President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court nominee in a fierce partisan brawl, approving a rule change dubbed the \"nuclear option\" to allow for conservative judge Neil Gorsuch's confirmation by Friday.\n\nWith ideological control of the country's highest court at stake, the Republican-led Senate voted 52-48 along party lines to change its long-standing rules in order to prohibit a procedural tactic called a filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. That came after Republicans failed by a 55-45 tally to muster the 60-vote super-majority needed to end the Democratic filibuster that had sought to deny Gorsuch confirmation to the lifetime post.\n\nThe Senate's action cleared the way to confirm Gorsuch by simple majority on Friday, with a final vote expected by late morning. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change was called the \"nuclear option\" because it was considered an extreme break with Senate tradition.\n\nTrump had encouraged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to \"go nuclear.\" Confirmation of Gorsuch would represent Trump's first major victory since taking office on Jan. 20, after setbacks on healthcare legislation and the blocking of his order that sought to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nSenate confirmation of Gorsuch, a Colorado-based federal appeals could judge, would restore the nine-seat court's 5-4 conservative majority, enable Trump to leave an indelible mark on America's highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. Gorsuch, 49, could be expected to serve for decades.\n\n\"This will be the first and last partisan filibuster of the Supreme Court,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor, accusing Democrats of trying to inflict political damage on Trump and to keep more conservatives from joining the high court.\n\n\"In 20 or 30 or 40 years, we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court, a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our founders intended for these institutions: principles of bipartisanship, moderation and consensus,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nSchumer ridiculed McConnell's contention that the Democratic action was unprecedented. He noted that the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland for the same seat that Trump selected Gorsuch to fill.\n\nWith three of the court's justices 78 or older, Trump told reporters he hoped to appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices, a move likely to make it overwhelmingly conservative.\n\n\"In fact, under a certain scenario there could even be more than that,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting with China's president in Florida, adding that the Senate rule change would not alter how he picks court nominees.\n\nCONSERVATIVE INFLUENCE\n\nA conservative-majority court is more likely to support broad gun rights, an expansive view of religious liberty, abortion regulations and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years.\n\nA 60-vote threshold giving the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments.\n\nIn the final procedural vote that paved the way for confirmation, three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp - broke with their party and voted with Republicans to bring about a confirmation vote, although they opposed the rule change.\n\nA fourth Democrat, Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuch's home state of Colorado, voted with Republicans on Thursday's first procedural vote to bring debate to a close. But he stuck with fellow Democrats in opposing the final vote to end the filibuster, the one that succeeded following the rule change.\n\nRepublicans have called Gorsuch superbly qualified and one of the nation's most distinguished appellate judges.\n\nDemocrats accused him of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump.\n\nWhat Republicans did to Obama's nominee Garland was worse than a filibuster, Schumer said. Schumer said Republicans denied \"the constitutional prerogative of a president with 11 months left in his term.\"\n\n\"The nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick Garland,\" Democratic Senator Richard Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"What we face today is the fallout.\"\n\nMcConnell blamed the escalation of fights over judicial nominees on the Democrats and their opposition starting three decades ago to nominees made by Republican former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\n\nExperts said eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments could make it more likely that presidents, with little incentive to choose centrist justices who could attract support from the other party, will pick ideologically extreme nominees in the future.\n\nEnding the filibuster also would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party.\n\nThe filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s.\n\nWhile Democrats opposed the rule change and accused Republicans of a power grab, it was their party that first resorted to the nuclear option when they controlled the Senate in 2013. In the face of Republican filibusters of Obama appointments, they barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices but still allowed it for Supreme Court nominees and legislation.\n\nThe Republican-backed rule change maintains the ability to filibuster legislation.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan, Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Additional reporting by Steve Holland aboard Air Force One; Editing by Will Dunham and Bill Trott)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN17814Y"}, {"title": "Illinois House opts for another stopgap budget amid impasse", "text": "CHICAGO The Illinois House passed $817 million in spending on Thursday to provide \"life-line\" funding to higher education and social service and health programs that have been starved for cash due to the state's budget impasse.\n\nThe measure passed in a 64-45 vote over Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's opposition to another stopgap spending measure.

The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\nWHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign.\n\nWHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators.\n\nWHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \"21st Century Glass-Steagall.\" Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions.\n\nCOULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren's proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system.\n\nARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules.\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-trump-factbox-idUSKBN1782QM"}, {"title": "U.S. Commerce chief says EXIM Bank part of Trump 'trade toolbox'", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross holds a news conference at the Department of Commerce in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 10, 2017.

More extreme U.S. justices, experts say", "text": "WASHINGTON A Republican-backed Senate rule change expected on Thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme U.S. Supreme Court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices, experts said.\n\nWith a deep partisan divide in Washington, Democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell has threatened to change long-standing rules in the 100-seat Senate if the Democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against Supreme Court nominees. That would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a 60-vote super-majority.\n\nExperts said the rule change, called the \"nuclear option,\" could produce an ever-more ideologically polarized Supreme Court. Over the years with the Senate narrowly divided, the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party.\n\nFor the court, the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees, said Stephen Wermiel, a Supreme Court scholar at the American University Washington College of Law.\n\n\"Although it has not been widely used, the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor,\" Wermiel said.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, a defender of Senate traditions, warned of the consequences of the rule change, though he said he would reluctantly support the move.\n\n\"We will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right,\" McCain said. \"I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsay Graham said Supreme Court nominees \"are going to be more ideological, not less\" with the rule change, which he warily supported.\n\n'LAST SHRED OF BIPARTISANSHIP'\n\nThe nuclear option would erase \"the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the filibuster against Gorsuch.\n\nElimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine-seat court after Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Three current justices are 78 or older: liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84; conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sides with the court's liberals in big cases, is 80; and liberal Stephen Breyer is 78.\n\nHaving more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law, said University of Massachusetts, Amherst political science professor Paul Collins, co-author of a book on Supreme Court confirmation hearings.\n\nIf confirmed as expected on Friday, Gorsuch would restore the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees, Wermiel said.\n\nWithout a filibuster, a future Democratic president with a Democratic-led Senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left. The result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be, said Brookings Institution think tank expert Russell Wheeler said.\n\n\"An ideologically-driven administration would eschew middle-of-the-road judges,\" Wheeler said. \"They would stack the court with ideological soulmates.\"\n\nTrump advisor Leonard Leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process. Trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he made public, and the voters elected Trump, Leo said.\n\n\"People knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president,\" Leo said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-nuclear-idUSKBN17814D"}, {"title": "Trump drops Steve Bannon from National Security Council", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump removed his chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council on Wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions.\n\nTrump's overhaul of the NSC, confirmed by a White House official, also elevated General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence who heads all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.

In recent days, several other senior U.S. foreign policy and national security officials have said the mechanisms for shaping the Trump administration's response to pressing challenges such as Syria, North Korea and Iran still were not in place.\n\nCritics of Bannon's role on the NSC said it gave too much weight in decision-making to someone who lacked foreign policy expertise.\n\nBannon, who was chief executive of Trump's presidential campaign in the months leading to his election in November, in some respects represents Trump's \"America First\" nationalistic voice, helping fuel his anti-Washington fervor and pushing for the president to part ways at times with mainstream Republicans.\n\nBefore joining the Trump administration, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a right-wing website.\n\nU.S. Representative Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called the shift in the NSC a positive step that will help McMaster \"gain control over a body that was being politicized by Bannon's involvement.\"\n\n\"As the administration's policy over North Korea, China, Russia and Syria continues to drift, we can only hope this shake-up brings some level of strategic vision to the body,\" he said.\n\nSOURCE: STILL INFLUENTIAL\n\nBannon's removal from the NSC was a potential setback for his sphere of influence in the Trump White House, where he has a voice in most major decisions. But a Trump confidant said Bannon remained as influential as ever.\n\n\"He is still involved in everything and still has the full confidence of the president but to be fair he can only do so much stuff,\" the confidant said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe White House official said Bannon was no longer needed on the NSC after the departure of Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\n\nFlynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump taking office on Jan. 20.\n\nThe official said Bannon had been placed on the NSC originally as a check on Flynn and had only attended one of the NSC's regular meetings.\n\nThe official dismissed questions about a power struggle between Bannon and McMaster, saying they shared the same world view.\n\nHowever, two current national security officials rejected the White House explanation, noting that two months have passed since Flynn's departure.\n\nMcMaster, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also has dueled with Bannon and others over direct access to Trump; the future of deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator; intelligence director Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn appointee; and other staffing decisions.\n\nTrump is preparing for his first face-to-face meeting on Thursday and Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping with the threat of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs a key component of their talks.\n\nBannon's seat on the NSC's \"principals' committee,\" a group that includes the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides, was taken by Rick Perry, who as energy secretary is charged with overseeing the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Tom Brown, Bill Trott and Michael Perry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-security-idUSKBN17724S"}, {"title": "Factbox: Gorsuch fight puts long-held Senate tradition at stake", "text": "WASHINGTON Republicans are poised to repeal a U.S. Senate rule that allows minority-party Democrats to block confirmation of Supreme Court nominees, including President Donald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime post.\n\nThe expected rule change, amid deepening partisanship in a chamber known as \"the world's greatest deliberative body,\" is raising questions over whether there could be a future move to prohibit \"filibusters\" on legislation.\n\nHere is how the filibuster has been used and what curtailing it could mean:\n\nWHAT IS A FILIBUSTER?\n\nIt is a procedural move, often by a minority of senators, to block legislation or Supreme Court nominations that typically enjoy the support of majority-party senators, in this case, Republicans.\n\nAccording to Senate historians, \"filibuster\" comes from a Dutch word meaning \"pirate.\"\n\nThe practice became popular in the 1850s and was also used by House of Representatives members, until that body became so large with an expanding U.S. population as to require stricter rules governing floor debates.\n\nSenate Democrats have gathered more than the 41 votes they need in the 100-seat chamber to mount a filibuster against Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge.\n\nWHAT DOES GEORGE WASHINGTON HAVE TO DO WITH FILIBUSTERS?\n\nThe first U.S. president is said to have observed that the Senate was created to cool legislation from the hot-tempered House just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea. The filibuster is just such a coolant.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWhen a bill or Supreme Court nomination hits the Senate floor, senators who oppose it can talk until at least 60 senators band together to limit debate. That gives a minority of senators huge power. If a bill or a nomination fails to draw the needed 60 votes, it is effectively killed.\n\nThe all-time record for a Senate filibuster speech - 24 hours, 18 minutes - was set by the late segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond, who tried unsuccessfully in 1957 to kill a civil rights bill.\n\nThis week, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley delivered the eighth-longest speech, against Gorsuch, that was 15 hours, 26 minutes.\n\nWHAT IS THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION?'?\n\nIt is Senate slang for banning filibusters through a rules change by the majority party.\n\nIn recent years, as filibusters have added to Senate gridlock, there have been threats to execute the nuclear option. Groups of senators, known as \"gangs,\" have sometimes defused the threats.\n\nIn 2013, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid deployed the nuclear option when he became fed up with Republican filibusters against then-President Barack Obama's nominees. He changed Senate rules to ban filibusters against the president's judicial and executive-branch nominees but left it in place for Supreme Court appointees.\n\nNow, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is thought to be ready to expand the ban to Supreme Court nominees.\n\nWILL FILIBUSTERS ON LEGISLATION BE BANNED?\n\nMcConnell has told reporters he will not broaden the ban on filibusters to legislation and does not believe Republican senators would want to do that.\n\nSome political scientists think Democrats have more to gain than Republicans by ending filibusters on legislation.\n\n\"My sense has always been that Democratic policy priorities have suffered more from the filibuster than Republican priorities,\" said George Washington University political science professor Sarah Binder. That is because Democrats are more likely than Republicans to back an expansion of government programs, which generally requires legislation.\n\nBut Binder said she could imagine Democrats or Republicans trying to score a major win on an issue central to their constituencies.\n\nFor Democrats: No filibuster could mean trying to pass another major healthcare or campaign finance reform or new gun controls. For Republicans: Some sort of major deregulation of an industry or changes to \"entitlement\" programs such as Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-filibuster-factbox-idUSKBN178176"}, {"title": "Senate set for pivotal vote on Supreme Court nominee", "text": "FILE PHOTO - U.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Neil Gorsuch testifies during a third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2017.

Republicans said Gorsuch would be confirmed on Friday one way or the other.\n\nSenate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would reinstate the nine-member court's conservative majority, allowing Trump to leave an indelible mark on America's highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president.\n\n\"There is still time for them to support a nominee who even longtime Democrats have praised, or at the very least, do not block him with the first successful partisan filibuster in American history,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the Democrats on Wednesday.\n\nDuring Senate debate on Wednesday, various Republicans called the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge \"incredibly qualified,\" an \"intellectual heavyweight\" and \"always true to the law.\"\n\nDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer indicated, however, that Democrats intended to follow through on their filibuster pledge, having gathered more than the 41 votes they need to mount the effort. A filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation. Republicans control the Senate 52-48.\n\n\"We Democrats believe the answer isn\u2019t to change the rules, it\u2019s to change the nominee, as presidents of both parties have done when a nominee fails to earn confirmation,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nDemocrats accuse Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump.\n\nThey are also angry that Senate Republicans last year refused to consider former Democratic President Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, the same seat Gorsuch has been named to fill.\n\n'NUCLEAR OPTION'\n\nThe rule change, which requires a simple majority, has been dubbed the \"nuclear option,\" and Trump has encouraged McConnell to \"go nuclear.\"\n\nEnding the filibuster would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, known as a defender of Senate traditions, offered reluctant support for the rule change, but said it would likely lead to judicial nominees \"from the extremes of both left and right.\"\n\nThe 60-vote threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments.\n\n(Additional reporting by Andrew Chung and Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney.)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN178170"}, {"title": "'Nuclear option' fallout? More extreme U.S. justices, experts say", "text": "WASHINGTON A Republican-backed Senate rule change expected on Thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme U.S. Supreme Court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices, experts said.\n\nWith a deep partisan divide in Washington, Democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell has threatened to change long-standing rules in the 100-seat Senate if the Democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against Supreme Court nominees. That would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a 60-vote super-majority.\n\nExperts said the rule change, called the \"nuclear option,\" could produce an ever-more ideologically polarized Supreme Court. Over the years with the Senate narrowly divided, the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party.\n\nFor the court, the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees, said Stephen Wermiel, a Supreme Court scholar at the American University Washington College of Law.\n\n\"Although it has not been widely used, the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor,\" Wermiel said.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, a defender of Senate traditions, warned of the consequences of the rule change, though he said he would reluctantly support the move.\n\n\"We will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right,\" McCain said. \"I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsay Graham said Supreme Court nominees \"are going to be more ideological, not less\" with the rule change, which he warily supported.\n\n'LAST SHRED OF BIPARTISANSHIP'\n\nThe nuclear option would erase \"the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the filibuster against Gorsuch.\n\nElimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine-seat court after Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Three current justices are 78 or older: liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84; conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sides with the court's liberals in big cases, is 80; and liberal Stephen Breyer is 78.\n\nHaving more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law, said University of Massachusetts, Amherst political science professor Paul Collins, co-author of a book on Supreme Court confirmation hearings.\n\nIf confirmed as expected on Friday, Gorsuch would restore the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees, Wermiel said.\n\nWithout a filibuster, a future Democratic president with a Democratic-led Senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left. The result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be, said Brookings Institution think tank expert Russell Wheeler said.\n\n\"An ideologically-driven administration would eschew middle-of-the-road judges,\" Wheeler said. \"They would stack the court with ideological soulmates.\"\n\nTrump advisor Leonard Leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process. Trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that he made public, and the voters elected Trump, Leo said.\n\n\"People knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president,\" Leo said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-court-nuclear-idUSKBN178156"}, {"title": "Senator talks all night as Democrats fight Trump court nominee", "text": "File photo: Senator Jeff Merkley questions Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt during his confirmation hearing to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on his nomination to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, U.S., January 18, 2017.

He stood beside an easel holding graphics that an aide would periodically adjust.\n\n\"For the first time in U.S. history, a seat has been stolen from one president and delivered to another in a court-packing scheme. If that were to succeed, it would set a precedent that will haunt the court for decades to come,\" Merkley said.\n\nHe noted that the Republicans who control the Senate refused last year to consider former Democratic President Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, the same seat Gorsuch now has been named to fill.\n\nLater on the Senate floor, Republican Senator Cory Gardner countered that such an argument amounted to advocating that \"two wrongs must make a right.\"\n\nMerkley criticized Gorsuch's legal opinions and said Gorsuch would become a conservative legal activist on the court.\n\nAt one point, Merkley read a 1998 speech by one of the past giants of the Senate, Democrat Robert Byrd, decrying partisanship in Congress.\n\n\"I believe that the American people are more than tired of partisan warfare. I believe they wish for less of it from Congress, especially in the Senate, where more statesmanship and a longer view are expected,\" Merkley said, quoting Byrd.\n\nThe Senate has a lengthy history of long speeches, including notable ones in recent years by Senators Ted Cruz, Chris Murphy and Rand Paul.\n\nThe Senate Historical Office listed Merkley's speech at 15 hours and 26 minutes, the eighth longest in Senate history. The longest came in 1957 when segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against legislation, later enacted, protecting black voting rights.\n\n'INTELLECTUAL HEAVYWEIGHT'\n\nOn the second day of formal Senate debate on Gorsuch's nomination, various Republicans called the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge \"incredibly qualified,\" an \"intellectual heavyweight\" and \"always true to the law.\"\n\n\"Democrats are bowing to hard-left special interests that can't get over the results of the election and thus are demanding complete Democratic opposition to everything this president touches,\" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.\n\nDemocrats accuse Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change, which requires a simple majority, has been dubbed the \"nuclear option,\" and Trump has urged McConnell to \"go nuclear.\"\n\nA filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation.\n\nThe 60-vote super-majority threshold empowers the minority party to hold up the majority party and has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship on legislation and presidential appointments.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, known as a defender of Senate traditions, offered reluctant support for the rule change, but said it likely would lead to judicial nominees \"from the extremes of both left and right.\"\n\n\"What we are about to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I fear that some day we will regret what we're about to do.

But he also said that with interest rates low, the government may be better off financing the projects itself.\n\n\"When you can borrow so inexpensively, you don\u2019t have to do the public-private thing.

The hearing also covered Gottlieb's views on issues ranging from clinical trials to the opioid epidemic and vaccines.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy said Democrats had \"a level of discomfort\" with Gottlieb's nomination, not just because of his private industry background but also because of his prior activity as a political adviser to Republican presidential candidates and opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The worry about impartiality is certainly connected to the private sector experience but it's also to your very deep political involvement as well,\" Murphy said.\n\nGottlieb, 44, acknowledged the concern, but said he would \"work hard to make sure I preserve my impartiality.\"\n\nIn an ethics disclosure form filed last month Gottlieb said he would resign from multiple corporate boards and divest his healthcare company holdings.\n\nRepublicans on the committee said Gottlieb's background would provide him with valuable insight into the industry that the FDA regulates.\n\nGottlieb said his goal was to implement the provisions in the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act that among other things require the FDA to consider ways to streamline the clinical trial process. He said he would be in favor of \"clinical trial constructs that don't require the tight randomization that current clinical trials do.\"\n\nGottlieb also said he would be willing to challenge the view that vaccines cause autism, a theory that has been widely debunked by vaccine experts. In January Trump's transition team floated the idea of forming a panel on autism.\n\nIn 2014 Trump said in a tweet that he believed in vaccinations \"but not massive, all at once, shots\" and that \"Govt. Should stop NOW!\"\n\nGottlieb said the question of whether vaccines cause autism \"is one of the most exhaustively studied issues in medicine\" and that there is no causal link between vaccines and autism. Pressed on whether he would challenge contrary views, Gottlieb said he has a history \"of not being shy about speaking truth to power and making my views known.\"\n\nGottlieb called the opioid epidemic \"a public health emergency on the order of Ebola and Zika.\" He said it is the biggest health crisis facing the FDA and that solving the problem would require a broad public health response.\n\nGottlieb, who held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, said some e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes and be less harmful.\n\n\"An e-cigarette or vaping product might be a good smoking cessation tool while a chocolate chip-flavored e-cigarette might not be,\" he said.

The bulk of them have no plans to alter their multi-billion dollar, years-long shift away from coal, suggesting demand for the fuel will keep falling despite Trump's efforts.\n\nThe utilities gave many reasons, mainly economic: Natural gas - coal\u2019s top competitor - is cheap and abundant; solar and wind power costs are falling; state environmental laws remain in place; and Trump's regulatory rollback may not survive legal challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, big investors aligned with the global push to fight climate change \u2013 such as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund \u2013 have been pressuring U.S. utilities in which they own stakes to cut coal use.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to build new coal plants in today\u2019s environment,\" said Ben Fowke, CEO of Xcel Energy, which operates in eight states and uses coal for about 36 percent of its electricity production. \"And if I\u2019m not going to build new ones, eventually there won\u2019t be any.\"\n\nREUTERS RECOMMENDS\n\nWindow closing for Republican stealth assault on regulations\n\nAfter Australian cyclone, coking coal spikes as China chases U.S. supplies\n\nOf the 32 utilities contacted by Reuters, 20 said Trump's order would have no impact on their investment plans; five said they were reviewing the implications of the order; six gave no response. Just one said it would prolong the life of some of its older coal-fired power units.\n\nNorth Dakota's Basin Electric Power Cooperative was the sole utility to identify an immediate positive impact of Trump's order on the outlook for coal.\n\n\"We\u2019re in the situation where the executive order takes a lot of pressure off the decisions we had to make in the near term, such as whether to retrofit and retire older coal plants,\" said Dale Niezwaag, a spokesman for Basin Electric. \"But Trump can be a one-termer, so the reprieve out there is short.\"\n\nTrump's executive order triggered a review aimed at killing the Clean Power Plan. The Obama-era law would have required states, by 2030, to collectively cut carbon emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels. It was designed as a primary strategy in U.S. efforts to fight global climate change.\n\nThe U.S. coal industry, without increases in domestic demand, would need to rely on export markets for growth. Shipments of U.S. metallurgical coal, used in the production of steel, have recently shown up in China following a two-year hiatus - in part to offset banned shipments from North Korea and temporary delays from cyclone-hit Australian producers.\n\nRETIRING AND RETROFITTING\n\nCoal had been the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for the last century, but its use has fallen more than a third since 2008 after advancements in drilling technology unlocked new reserves of natural gas.\n\nHundreds of aging coal-fired power plants have been retired or retrofitted. Huge coal mining companies like Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal fell into bankruptcy, and production last year hit its lowest point since 1978.\n\nThe slide appears likely to continue: U.S. power companies now expect to retire or convert more than 8,000 megawatts of coal-fired plants in 2017 after shutting almost 13,000 MW last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration and Thomson Reuters data.\n\nLuke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, acknowledged Trump's efforts would not return the coal industry to its \"glory days,\" but offered some hope.\n\n\"There may not be immediate plans for utilities to bring on more coal, but the future is always uncertain in this market,\" he said.\n\nMany of the companies in the Reuters survey said they had been focused on reducing carbon emissions for a decade or more and were hesitant to change direction based on shifting political winds in Washington D.C.\n\n\"Utility planning typically takes place over much longer periods than presidential terms of office,\" Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned Pacificorp spokesman Tom Gauntt said.\n\nSeveral utilities also cited falling costs for wind and solar power, which are now often as cheap as coal or natural gas, thanks in part to government subsidies for renewable energy.\n\nIn the meantime, activist investors have increased pressure on U.S. utilities to shun coal.\n\nIn the last year, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has excluded more than a dozen U.S. power companies - including Xcel, American Electric Power Co Inc and NRG Energy Inc - from its investments because of their reliance on coal-fired power.\n\nAnother eight companies, including Southern Co and NorthWestern Corp, are \"under observation\" by the fund.\n\nWyoming-based coal miner Cloud Peak Energy said it doesn't blame utilities for being lukewarm to Trump's order.\n\n\"For eight years, if you were a utility running coal, you got the hell kicked out of you,\" said Richard Reavey, a spokesman for the company. \"Are you going to turn around tomorrow and say, 'Let's buy lots of coal plants'? Pretty unlikely.\"\n\nInfographic ID: '2n8FQIs'\n\n(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-climate-power-idUSKBN1770D8"}, {"title": "House Democrats press Trump to release tax returns", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the 2017 North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference in Washington, U.S., April 4, 2017.

His first official task after being sworn in would come at an April 13 private meeting among the justices to discuss taking various appeals from lower courts.\n\nThere are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public, state voting restrictions critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout, and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to serving gay couples. All three could lead to landmark rulings if taken up.\n\nOn April 17, the justices will begin hearing a new round of oral arguments, including a closely watched case on the separation of church and state focusing on whether a Missouri church was improperly denied state funds. The court is nearing the end of its current term, which runs from October to June.\n\nGorsuch also would play a key role in important cases the justices already have agreed to hear in their next term, including a bid by employers to prevent workers from bringing class action claims, a goal of big business.\n\nThe court has been divided between four conservatives and four liberals since the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nMajor issues before the court highlight the significance of Gorsuch filling Scalia's seat and restoring the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Senate Republicans paved the way for Trump to replace Scalia by refusing last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. That would have given the court a liberal majority for the first time in decades.\n\nLegal experts suspect a conservative majority on the court could motivate conservative lawyers to bring cases in a hope that five justices will back abortion restrictions, oppose political spending limits, and favor wider gun and religious rights.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the four liberals, will remain the court's swing vote. Most experts expect Gorsuch to be more aligned with the court's two most stalwart conservatives, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"There's no reason to think he will be anything other than extremely conservative,\" said Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro.\n\nPENDING APPEALS\n\nWith four votes needed to take up a case at the private meetings, each justice is important. Among pending appeals the court is likely to act on in the coming weeks is a case in which activists have asked the justices to rule for the first time that the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms, extends to carrying firearms outside the home.\n\nIn another case, the court could decide whether to revive voter-identification and other restrictions in North Carolina blocked by a lower court. The justices also could hear a Christian baker's religious claim that he should not be forced to sell a cake to a gay couple.\n\nConservative justices generally take expansive views of gun and religious rights and may back state laws whose Republican backers say are intended to prevent voter fraud.\n\nOn April 19, the court will hear a religious rights case in which a church contends Missouri violated the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations.\n\nGorsuch has ruled several times in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge.\n\n\"Given Gorsuch's solicitude for religious liberty, his joining the court can only help the church,\" said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank.\n\nThere are several cases the court has already heard but has not yet decided in which Gorsuch could play a role. The court has the option of hearing fresh arguments, with Gorsuch in a position to cast a potential deciding vote.\n\nOne such case is a bid by Miami to revive lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers.\n\nAnother concerns whether the family of a Mexican teenager can sue a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas.\n\nLonger term, an issue likely to return to the court is a conservative-backed challenge that could weaken organized labor. The court was expected to deny unions a vital source of cash last year. But after Scalia died, it issued a 4-4 ruling leaving in place a lower court's decision favoring unions.\n\nThe court is also likely to weigh in on whether transgender students are protected under a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education. The court took up that question last fall but in March sent the case back to a lower court without resolving the main legal question.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-cases-idUSKBN1771B8"}, {"title": "Senators urge Tillerson to meet with activists in Russia", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a news conference in Ankara, Turkey, March 30, 2017.

He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.\n\nCritics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nBut they also worry Trump's policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a 'grand bargain' involving other issues such as North Korea.\n\nTrump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled.\n\n\"With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it,\" said Randal Phillips, Mintz Group's Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China.\n\n'ACTIONS, NOT WORDS'\n\nSome of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble.\n\nU.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit.\n\nU.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, China's is 25 percent.\n\nBut the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that China's new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals.\n\nThe Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to \"stop rigging markets\". It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction.\n\nTrump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements.\n\nIn a phone call with Xi after taking office, Trump gave ground on one of Beijing's most sensitive issues \u2013 the status of Taiwan - after earlier suggesting he might not stick to Washington's long-held \"one China\" policy.\n\nTrump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were \"going to get down to some serious business\" and vowed that \"the theft of American prosperity\" by foreign countries would end.\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries' economic structures and noted China had a trade deficit in services.\n\nChina tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year.\n\nTRADE WARS\n\nSome in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.\n\nJacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take \"positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war\".\n\nThe list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said.\n\nChina is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.\n\nSteve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a \"prudent\" approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a \"workman-like manner\", recognizing that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers.\n\nWilliam Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said \"it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations\".\n\nBut several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trump's lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship.\n\n\"It's not yet clear whether ... this is a White House that wants to fundamentally reset the terms of the relationship or tinker at the edges and declare a public relations win,\" said a China expert at a Washington business lobby who asked not to be named.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing; Diane Bartz, David Shepardson and Joel Schectman in Washington; Nichola Groom in Los Angeles; and Mark Weinraub in Chicago; Editing by Bill Tarrant)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-business-idUSKBN17616Y"}, {"title": "Factbox: Trump Supreme Court pick to affect pending cases", "text": "President Donald Trump's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, could have an immediate impact on cases already pending before the justices, if he is confirmed by the Senate as expected by the end of the week.\n\nThe nine-seat court has been operating with only eight justices since the death of conservative Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016.

Miami\n\nThe eight-justice court appeared closely divided when it heard arguments in this case in November on whether Miami could pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers. The court may need to reargue the case with Gorsuch on board to avoid a 4-4 split.\n\nCross-border shooting: Hernandez v. Mesa\n\nA possible 4-4 split appeared on the cards when the court heard arguments in this civil rights case in February. The court has been asked to revive a civil rights lawsuit filed by the family of a Mexican teenager against a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas in 2010.\n\nCorporate liability: Jesner v. Arab Bank\n\nIn a case to be heard next term, the court agreed this week to consider reviving litigation that seeks to hold Arab Bank Plc ARBK.AM financially liable for militant attacks in Israel and the Palestinian territories and accuses the Jordan-based bank of being the \"paymaster\" to militant groups. The question of whether companies can be held liable for actions overseas under a federal law called the Alien Tort Statute is one the court took up but failed to decide in 2013.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-pending-factbox-idUSKBN1771AU"}, {"title": "Senate Republican leader starts clock ticking to Gorsuch showdown", "text": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks to reporters after the weekly Republican caucus policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 28, 2017.

Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change has been dubbed the \"nuclear option,\" and Trump has encouraged McConnell to \"go nuclear.\"\n\nSuch a step would threaten to further erode trust between the parties in Congress.\n\n\"There's a reason they call it the nuclear option, and that is because there's fallout. And this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the Senate for years to come,\" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters.\n\nRepublicans were so confident they could use their muscle to pass the rule change that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said flatly that Gorsuch \"will be on the Supreme Court Friday night.\"\n\nAmid a fierce debate over both Gorsuch and the Senate's rules, McConnell tried to tamp down any speculation that Republicans would stage a monumental power grab by ending the filibuster for legislation.\n\nMcConnell said that as long as he was the Senate's majority leader, he would never remove the ability to mount a filibuster against legislation, as opposed to presidential appointments. McConnell fought against many of former Democratic President Barack Obama's legislative initiatives when Republicans were the minority party in the Senate.\n\n\"There's not a single senator in the (Republican) majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster, not one,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nThe move to change venerable Senate rules reflects an intensifying of the already-toxic partisanship in Washington since Trump took office in January.\n\nMcConnell's promise to keep the ability to filibuster legislation could make it more difficult for Republicans to get key parts of Trump's legislative agenda through the Senate, considering the expected strong Democratic opposition.\n\n'BREAK THE RULES'\n\nA filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation.\n\nThe 60-vote super-majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments.\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday kicked off its formal debate on confirming Gorsuch, a Colorado-based appeals court judge, and McConnell said he would get the clock ticking toward a vote expected on Thursday to stop the Democrats' filibuster.\n\nDemocrats on Monday amassed the votes needed to sustain the filibuster, prompting Republicans to move toward changing the rules.\n\nDemocratic Senator Jeff Merkley took to the Senate floor on Tuesday evening to rally support for the Gorsuch filibuster. His office said in a statement that he \"plans to hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking.\" Merkley's \"talking filibuster\" is not expected to affect the Republican timetable for Gorsuch's confirmation.\n\nThe filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s.\n\nThe Democrats were the first to use the \"nuclear option.\" In 2013, when they controlled the Senate, they changed it to bar filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices. They did so after Republicans filibustered Obama's appeals court nominees.\n\n\"Democrats are now being pushed by far-left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"They seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time, and trying to take the Senate with them.\"\n\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said it was the Republicans who bore responsibility for the crisis and for deciding, as he said, to \"break the rules.\"\n\nHe noted that the Senate, under McConnell's guidance, refused last year to consider Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy that Trump elected Gorsuch to fill.\n\n\"What the majority leader did to Merrick Garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nRestoring the nine-seat high court's conservative majority would fulfill one of Trump's top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nRepublicans say Gorsuch is well qualified for the job and that there is no principled reason to oppose him. Democrats say he is so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, has favored corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and has shown insufficient independence from Trump.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan and Tim Ahmann; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1760YL"}, {"title": "Window closing for Republican stealth assault on U.S. regulations", "text": "WASHINGTON The clock began running out this week on a strategy that has provided U.S. Republicans in Congress with their only notable legislative successes this year: aggressive use of an obscure U.S. law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).\n\nOn his 75th day in power, President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors, but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy.\n\nVice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an \"avalanche of red tape\" from the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\n\nREUTERS COMMENTARY\n\nWar College: One tank to rule them all\n\nThe right way to address the Marines United Facebook Group\n\nIn legal battles against travel ban, Trump's own statements are his worst enemy\n\nSince Trump took office on Jan. 20, McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations, most of concern to business interests.\n\nTrump has signed 11 of these into law, not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing \"substantially similar\" regulations in the future.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is \"vastly different\" from past presidents in rolling back regulations.\n\nOn Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams.\n\nLast Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obama's administration. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May.\n\nDemocrats assail the reversals as harming the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists.\n\nRepresentative Louise Slaughter, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes, said in an interview \"of course it benefits the lobbyists.\"\n\nBut she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore.\n\n\"Partly I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have anything else to do,\" she said about Republicans' eagerness. \"Other than that I think it's just another 'take that Obama.'\"\n\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES\n\nMcCarthy, a Californian and the No. 2 House Republican, saw the CRA's potential before the election. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon, if the stars aligned.\n\nUnder the law, resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the president's signature. So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work. The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office.\n\nThe stars aligned on Nov. 8, when Republicans captured the White House, Senate and House. For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans. The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30.\n\nRight after the election, McCarthy told his party to \"go through each regulation on our priority list,\" he said.\n\n\"If you look at Article One of the Constitution, this isn\u2019t the role of these agencies. The agencies have become too big,\" McCarthy said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe first resolutions sailed through, primarily because Republicans had opposed the regulations long before they were finalized. McCarthy said so many lawmakers objected to the stream pollution rule that wiping it off the books was easy.\n\nEven though the CRA effort is winding down, McCarthy's brief campaign showed that aggressive use of the law could succeed, and provided Republicans with some modest, but needed successes in a time when they are struggling with larger matters.\n\n\"After years of talk about cutting red tape, it is now actually happening,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday. \"We are reversing the Obama administration\u2019s most recent and last regulatory onslaught.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by David Shepardson and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-regulation-idUSKBN1762H9"}, {"title": "More talks but no decisions on Republican push to overhaul healthcare", "text": "White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus arrives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. April 4, 2017.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nWASHINGTON A U.S. House of Representatives vote to overhaul Obamacare before lawmakers leave Washington for a two-week break looked unlikely late on Tuesday as top White House deputies and key Republican groups said more discussions were needed.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and administration officials met on Capitol Hill for two hours with lawmakers from the moderate \"Tuesday Group,\" the conservative Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus, the rebel group of conservative lawmakers that derailed the first administration-backed healthcare bill last month.\n\nWhile progress had been made, the officials and House lawmakers said no bill text had been agreed on and no decisions had been made by the various Republican factions.\n\nThe lack of a resolution complicates a White House push for a House vote on a healthcare proposal before Friday, when lawmakers return to their districts for two weeks.\n\n\u201cGood talk, good progress,\u201d Pence told reporters without providing details.\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows said the meeting had focused on an amendment to create a \"backstop\" to ensure individuals with chronic illnesses in high-risk pools do not see spikes in insurance premium costs if other aspects of Obamacare, also known as the 2010 Affordable Care Act, are repealed.\n\n\u201cNo decisions were made. We\u2019re going to get back together tomorrow at a time to be determined,\u201d Meadows told reporters.\n\nRepublican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker said the focus when talks resumed would be on sticking points such as whether to allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandates that insurers must cover a minimum tier of services and cannot charge more to those with pre-existing conditions - a popular provision of the law that Trump has promised to protect.\n\nLEGISLATIVE TEST\n\nThe Republican failure last month to dismantle Obamacare was President Donald Trump's first major legislative setback and it raised questions about how he would build Republican consensus to deliver on other major legislative goals.\n\nMany Republicans were elected on promises to repeal and replace Obamacare but House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to withdraw the bill when it became clear there were not enough Republican votes to pass it.\n\nHard-line conservatives, such as those in the Freedom Caucus, thought it was too similar to former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Moderate conservatives balked at proposed changes to some of its most popular provisions that were sought by conservative lawmakers.\n\nTrump initially said he would move on to fulfilling other campaign promises such as a tax overhaul and infrastructure-spending package, but a new attempt at reviving the failed healthcare push took off on Monday when White House officials met Republican lawmakers.\n\nA source familiar with internal House Republican deliberations said healthcare, not taxes, now topped the House agenda and that the White House was driving the healthcare effort.\n\n\"They want to get this done as quickly as possible,\" Meadows told reporters after Tuesday's meeting.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have said the new push on healthcare would maintain Obamacare's essential health benefits clause listing services and care that insurers must cover. However, in a move to attract hard-line conservatives, states could apply for a waiver if they showed it would improve coverage and reduce costs.\n\nThe \"backstop\" for individuals in the high-risk pool discussed on Tuesday would direct additional funds to a $115 billion state stability fund authorized in the first Republican bill. No final decision was made, even though there was consensus, lawmakers said.\n\n\"We\u2019re taking our time and working through policy and structure until we reach consensus,\" said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.\n\n\"Let\u2019s let the solution and common ground drive the timetable, rather than the other way. That was really the consensus,\" he said.\n\nRyan told reporters after a closed meeting with fellow Republicans on Tuesday morning that the renewed healthcare effort was simply in the \"conceptual stage right now,\" and did not give a timeline for having a bill on the House floor.\n\nTalk of a revived plan hurt shares of hospitals and insurers that have benefited from Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor, which extended insurance to millions of people and helped cut hospital debt.\n\nMajor hospital and medical groups, including the American Medical Association, were opposed to the initial Republican bill because it would lead to massive coverage losses and cuts in hospital revenue.\n\n(Additional reporting by Richard Cowan and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Amanda Becker and Alistair Bell; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Bill Trott and Paul Tait)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-idUSKBN1761ZQ"}, {"title": "Key House Republican says progress seen on healthcare sticking point", "text": "U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-NC) walks into a Speaker's office on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2017.

The visit to the Hammam al-Alil base included an operational briefing from Iraqi and U.S. commanders.\n\nThe trip has demonstrated the far-reaching portfolio of Kushner, 36, who is part of Trump's innermost circle and who has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. His views on Iraq could shape Trump's own opinions.\n\nIt comes as Trump is examining ways to accelerate a U.S.-led coalition campaign that U.S. and Iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\n\nMosul is by far the biggest city to have been held by Islamic State, and winning it back would largely destroy the Iraqi part of the group's \"caliphate,\" proclaimed from a Mosul mosque in 2014.\n\nThere are mounting concerns about civilian casualties in the final phases of the assault and questions about how quickly Mosul can be rebuilt, repopulated and governed in a way that avoids alienating its Sunni-majority population.\n\nThe Mosul battle, the biggest in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, has been under way since October, with 100,000 Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi'ite militiamen seeking to drive out the militants with the support of U.S.-led air strikes.\n\nAlthough Trump campaigned on defeating the hardline Sunni militant group, he has not announced any major changes to war strategy and it is unclear how Kushner's experience in Iraq might shape his advice to the president.\n\nSpeaking after lengthy battlefield reports from Iraq's military, Kushner sounded upbeat about the campaign and said the partnership between U.S. and Iraqi troops was \"very impressive.\"\n\nHe expressed hope the partnership would be enduring, signaling White House interest in longer-term U.S. military assistance.\n\n\"I hope the victory that you have in Mosul in the near future will not just be a victory for the American and Iraqi troops but it will be a victory for the world,\" Kushner said.\n\nISLAMIC STATE CONDEMNS TRUMP\n\nOn Tuesday, Islamic State issued its first official remarks referring to Trump since he assumed the U.S. presidency in January, describing him as an \"idiot.\"\n\n\"You (the U.S.) are bankrupt and the signs of your demise are evident to every eye,\" spokesman Abi al-Hassan al-Muhajer said in a recording released on the messaging network Telegram.\n\n\"There is no more evidence than (that) you being run by an idiot who does not know what Syria or Iraq or Islam is.\"\n\nEven after Mosul and other pockets of territory are recaptured, U.S. officials expect Islamic State to go underground and fight on as a more traditional insurgency.\n\nKushner's trip was his first to Iraq and the visit to Hammam al-Alil, where U.S. advisers and artillery are positioned to assist the battle in Mosul, was also the closest Dunford has gotten to Mosul since the campaign began.\n\nThey stopped briefly at Qayyara West Airfield, another key hub in the war, where U.S. forces manning High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems fired twice at Islamic State targets in Mosul the night before.\n\nIraqi security forces are engaged in fierce, house-to-house fighting in Mosul. Nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations, and it has had a heavy toll on civilians trapped in the city.\n\nThe advance has been slowed since March 17, when scores of people sheltering from air strikes were killed in a blast.

North Korea has been working to develop nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Trump is expected to repeat his call for China to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor and has warned that Washington might deal with Pyongyang's weapons programs alone if need be.\n\nChina says it is doing all it can and has said it is up to the United States to de-escalate with Pyongyang.\n\nA White House strategy review focuses on options for pressuring Pyongyang economically and militarily. Among measures under consideration are \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.\n\nA long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but the review \u201cde-emphasizes direct military action,\u201d a senior U.S. official said. Any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops stationed there. TRADE\n\nTrade is one of the biggest hot-button issues, given Trump\u2019s charges in his presidential campaign that Chinese trade practices were killing U.S. jobs and his vow to impose 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe administration has not acted on unilateral tariffs but is targeting a reduction in China's $347 billion goods trade surplus through tougher enforcement of trade laws and anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has also demanded \"reciprocity\" in the U.S.-China economic relationship, saying that U.S. companies do not enjoy the same access to China's vast market as Chinese firms get in the United States.\n\nChina says Washington should create better conditions for Chinese investment in the United States if it wants to correct the imbalance.\n\nNeither side wants a trade war, but it may be hard to do much more than lower the temperature in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSome analysts believe Xi may bring a package of job-creating Chinese investments and the prospect of a more open services sector that Trump could tweet as tangible achievements.\n\nSOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nRelations are also clouded by China's expansive claims in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing has been building artificial islands and installing military facilities on them.\n\nU.S. officials see this as part of a long-term Chinese bid to deny U.S. forces access to the strategic sea, a key global trade route.\n\nThey say Washington plans more robust naval operations to challenge Chinese claims and assert the right to freedom of navigation, though months have passed since the last one in October under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nThe situation in North Korea has appeared to push the South China Sea onto the back burner for now, but Trump is expected to air U.S. concerns.\n\nCURRENCY\n\nTrump has repeatedly charged that China manipulates its yuan currency to keep its exports cheap, and he is likely to raise the issue with Xi. But Trump did not make good on his promises to formally declare China a currency manipulator on the first day of his presidency.\n\nWhile economists believe China pushed down the value of the yuan in the past, China's central bank for much of the past two years has been working to prop up the yuan, amid capital outflow pressures, spending more than $1 trillion in the process.\n\nThis would make it very hard to justify a manipulator designation under the U.S. Treasury's current foreign exchange analysis, due one week after Xi's visit.\n\n\u201cONE CHINA\u201d AND TAIWAN\n\nThe summit would not be happening if Trump had not reaffirmed the \u201cone China\" policy that has underpinned relations for decades. Trump infuriated Beijing when, as president-elect, he took a call from Taiwan\u2019s president and suggested he might not abide by the policy. He backtracked in a call with Xi in February.\n\nXi may now be looking to head off a big new weapons package to Taiwan that U.S. officials have told Reuters is being crafted.\n\nFor its part, Taiwan will be watching anxiously for any sign that Trump is using it as a bargaining chip.\n\n(Reporting by Matt Spetalnick, David Brunnstrom and David Lawder; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-differences-factbox-idUSKBN1762WW"}, {"title": "Infrastructure overhaul may top $1 trillion, cut red tape: Trump", "text": "Ivanka Trump smiles while speaking at a CEO town hall on the American business climate at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building inWashington, U.S., April 4, 2017.

If he had chosen to meet with another lawyer without telling anyone, there would be no issue, Brafman said.\n\n\"He's interviewed half the lawyers in America, so that's not so much of a hypothetical,\" Brafman joked, alluding to Zarrab's hiring of more than a dozen lawyers at major firms.\n\nThe dispute highlights the politically charged nature of the case, which expanded in scope last week with the arrest of an executive at a Turkish state-owned bank accused of conspiring with Zarrab.

But the two men differ in almost every other respect, from their political styles to their diplomatic experience, adding uncertainty to what has been called the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship.\n\nFive months after his election on a stridently anti-China platform, Trump appears to have set himself on a course for collision rather than conciliation with Xi, raising doubts as to whether the world's two biggest economies can find common ground.\n\nTopping the agenda at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida will be whether he will make good on his threat to use crucial U.S.-China trade ties to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea, which is working to develop missiles capable of hitting the United States.\n\nTrump, a 70-year-old former real estate magnate with no foreign policy experience before entering the White House, has tweeted that it will be a \"very difficult\u201d meeting with the veteran Communist Party leader seven years his junior, given Chinese trade practices he says are killing U.S. jobs.\n\nHe has also demanded that Beijing do more to \u201csolve\u201d the North Korean problem \u2013 his biggest national security challenge - or he will act alone to deal with Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\n\nSome White House aides believe Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner could be an influential moderating voice on how he handles Xi in their talks on Thursday and Friday. Contacts between Kushner and China\u2019s U.S. envoy helped smooth the way for the meeting, according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\nEven so, what worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.\n\n\"Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,\u201d a Chinese official said.\n\nU.S. presidents\u2019 meetings with their Chinese counterparts are usually more tightly scripted than with other foreign leaders, something Chinese officials insist on to make sure they are treated with the decorum they believe befits a global power.\n\nThis summit should offer a study in contrasts: Trump impatient, outspoken and prone to angry tweet-storms; Xi, outwardly calm and measured, with no known social media presence.\n\nTheir shared nationalist tendencies could aggravate friction between their countries, which are increasingly global rivals.\n\nTrump insists the United States has been cheated economically for decades by countries like China and must regain its luster, while Xi wants China, once an ancient empire, to be able to flex its muscles on the world stage.\n\n\u201cXi and Trump are not natural friends,\u201d said a former senior U.S. official specializing in Asia. \"The question is when Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hits Xi\u2019s \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019, what\u2019s the result?\u201d\n\nWON\u2019T PULL PUNCHES\n\nIt remains unclear how far Trump will go in translating populist rhetoric into policy that steps up pressure on China, given the risk of a trade war neither country can afford.\n\nBut aides say he won't pull his punches, especially on trade, on which he has held an outspoken view for decades.\n\nThis adds to doubts as to whether the two leaders can find common ground on North Korea and China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n\nSome analysts question whether Trump can get the better of Xi, who was born into a life of politics and has a reputation for being a tough tactician.\n\n\"Xi\u2019s performed pretty well in these types of environments,\" said Christopher Johnson, a China expert and former CIA analyst at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhile Trump has been in office little more than 10 weeks, Xi has honed his U.S. strategy since assuming the Chinese leadership in 2013.\n\nThe son of a revolutionary leader, Xi has sought to project the image internationally of a strong advocate of globalization at a time when Trump has stoked fears of U.S. protectionism.\n\nStill, Chinese officials are mindful of the pitfalls if Trump veers off-script.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe found himself in a long, uncomfortable handshake at the White House in February, and Trump appeared to ignore German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s offer of a handshake during their meeting last month.\n\nAn acrimonious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull caused particular concern in Beijing, officials there say.\n\nStill, the decision to hold a summit so early in Trump\u2019s presidency suggests both Washington and Beijing see the value of trying to build a personal relationship between the two leaders.\n\nTrump goes into the meeting with significant gaps in his team of Asia advisers and his China policy still not fully formulated.\n\nHardliners like trade adviser Peter Navarro, who authored a book \u201cDeath by China,\u201d have feuded over the administration's approach to China with more pragmatic aides such as economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nAdministration officials argue Trump can use his \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d sales techniques to convince Xi that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, especially when it comes to market access.\n\nBut analysts say the Chinese are shrewd enough at geopolitics to fend off U.S. demands. Xi may also see Trump politically weakened by his high-profile legislative failure on healthcare as well as his low public approval ratings.\n\nTrump has already backed down on China's most sensitive issue - Taiwan - having first infuriated Beijing by suggesting he might not abide by Washington\u2019s long-standing \u201cone China\u201d policy. Trump may now feel he is owed a favor in return.\n\nA fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and China\u2019s U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, officials say, after Cui invited Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka to the Chinese Embassy's Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin.\n\nBoth sides are keeping expectations low for tangible outcomes from the summit, billed as informal \"get to know you\" meetings similar to the 2013 Sunnylands summit in California between Xi and Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nAnd whatever else, unlike Abe's February visit to Mar-a-Lago, there will be no golf diplomacy: China\u2019s Communist Party associates golf with shady dealings and has sought to stop officials from playing it as part of Xi's fight against corruption.\n\n(Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing and Steve Holland in Washington, Editing by Ross Colvin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-summit-analysis-idUSKBN1752FT"}, {"title": "Trump tells Sisi U.S., Egypt will fight Islamist militants together", "text": "Supporters of Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi gather outside the White House prior to his arrival for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2017.

It said the leaders \"agreed on the necessity of recognizing the peaceful nature of Islam and Muslims around the world.\"\n\nWhile Trump noted the United States and Egypt \"have a few things\" they do not agree on, he made no public airing of U.S. concerns about human rights in Egypt.\n\nRights groups have called for the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American who works with street children and was arrested in May 2014 on human trafficking charges.\n\nHijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pre-trial detention is 24 months.\n\nA senior administration official said the subject of Hijazi did not come up in the meeting with Trump, Sisi and their advisers, but said the detention was an issue of concern and a case that was being watched closely by the Trump administration.\n\nAt the United Nations in New York, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the Trump administration was not backing away from human rights \"because they fully support me speaking about human rights in the Security Council.\"\n\nHuman rights groups have estimated that Sisi's government has detained at least 40,000 political prisoners.\n\nEgypt has long been one of Washington's closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually.

A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity.\n\nIn a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an \"erroneous claim\" that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China.\n\nUNFPA said its mission is \"to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person\u2019s potential is fulfilled.\"\n\n\"The support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises,\" the statement said.\n\nThe cut follows Trump's proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month.\n\nU.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON Democrats on Monday corralled enough support to hold up a Senate confirmation vote on President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee but Republicans threatened to change the Senate rules to ensure conservative judge Neil Gorsuch gets the lifetime job.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-9 along party lines to send Gorsuch's nomination to the full Senate, setting up a political showdown this week between Trump's fellow Republicans and the opposition Democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long-standing Senate rules to allow his confirmation.\n\nDemocrats, portraying Gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream, have amassed 42 senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super-majority of 60 votes in the Republican-led, 100-seat Senate to allow a confirmation vote. Even before the panel voted, committee member Christopher Coons put the Democrats over the threshold as the 41st senator backing the filibuster bid. (GRAPHIC - Where senators stand on bid to block Gorsuch vote tmsnrt.rs/2ov6ko0)\n\nThe Senate's Republican leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on the Senate floor on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority.\n\nIn the face of the filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the Senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the \"nuclear option\" that Trump favors.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said McConnell should have the \"vision and courage to see past this impasse\" and not \"go nuclear,\" suggesting that Trump replace Gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with Democrats.\n\nSenate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine-seat high court's conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trump's top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump in January nominated Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from Colorado. He could be expected to serve for decades.\n\nOn the Senate floor, McConnell called the Democratic strategy \"a new low,\" saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as Gorsuch.\n\nHe did not explicitly say he would use the \"nuclear option,\" but several Republicans said that would happen. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the decision would be McConnell's. Republican Senator John McCain, a long-time opponent of Senate rules changes, told reporters he would support the move.\n\nJudiciary Committee Republicans blasted Democrats for pursuing what they called the first \"partisan filibuster\" of a Supreme Court nominee - there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a Democratic president's nominee - and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change.\n\nBut it was Senate Republicans who last year refused to even consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy that Trump has selected Gorsuch to fill.\n\n'STILL FURIOUS'\n\n\"Democrats, including me, are still furious at the way Judge Merrick Garland was treated last year. But the traditions and principles that have defined the Senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week,\" Coons said.\n\nGorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDemocrats have accused Gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of Trump, evading questions on key Supreme Court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans.\n\nRepublicans control the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade. The inability of Senate Republicans to coax enough Democratic support to avoid the \"nuclear option\" reflected the intense partisan divide in Washington and the Trump administration's failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party.\n\nSenators Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat, and panel member Patrick Leahy, along with fellow Democrats Mark Warner and Ben Cardin, also announced filibuster support on Monday.\n\nSpicer accused Democrats of partisan obstruction that sets \"a very dangerous precedent\" and told a briefing that \"we're obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nation's highest court.\"\n\nThe actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped. To date, four Democrats oppose a filibuster, four short of the eight that Republicans needed.\n\nWith the failure of Republican healthcare legislation in Congress and with courts blocking the president's ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States, winning confirmation for Gorsuch has taken on even more importance for Trump.\n\nThe 60-vote super-majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the Senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments.\n\nRepublican committee member Lindsey Graham said, \"If we have to, we will change the rules, and it looks like we're going to have to. I hate that. I really, really do.\"\n\nWhile Gorsuch's opponents would fight a Senate rule change, it was the Democrats who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to limit filibusters after Republicans used the procedure against Obama's appeals court nominees.\n\nThe Senate, then led by Democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices. Even if Republicans do change the rules, legislation, as opposed to appointments, would still need to meet a 60-vote threshold.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Mohammad Zargham, Tim Ahmann, Richard Cowan, Doina Chiacu and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1750CM"}, {"title": "Sen.

REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBAGHDAD U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, flew into Iraq on Monday with the top U.S. general to get a first-hand assessment of the battle against Islamic State from U.S. commanders on the ground and Iraqi leaders.\n\nFor Kushner, who has not been to Iraq before, the trip comes at a critical time as Trump examines ways to accelerate a U.S.-led coalition campaign that U.S. and Iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe visit appears to demonstrate the far-reaching portfolio of Kushner, 36, who is part of Trump's innermost circle and who has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal.\n\nMarine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he invited Kushner and Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, to accompany him so they could hear \"first-hand and unfiltered\" from military advisers about the situation on the ground and interact with U.S. forces.\n\n\"I said, 'Hey, next time I go to Iraq, if you're interested, come and it\u2019d be good,\" Dunford said, adding he extended the invitation weeks ago.\n\nThat kind of ground-level awareness of the war helps inform strategic decisions, Dunford said, adding it was the same reason he regularly leaves Washington to visit Iraq.\n\n\"The more appreciation you could have for what's actually happening on the ground, the more informed you are when you start talking about the strategic issues,\" Dunford said.\n\nKushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, did not speak with reporters.\n\nTrump campaigned on defeating Islamic State but has yet to announce any dramatic shift in war strategy.\n\nAfter arriving, Kushner joined Dunford for meetings with the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad and the senior American commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend.\n\nDunford's delegation also met Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose office said their talks focused on the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State and U.S.-led coalition assistance, including aiding civilians displaced by the fighting.\n\n\"The delegation affirmed its support to Iraq in the war on terror,\" Abadi's office said in a statement.\n\nU.S. ROLE AFTER MOSUL FIGHT\n\nThe trip comes as Iraqi security forces engage in fierce, house-to-house fighting in Mosul, Islamic State's last major stronghold in Iraq and the city where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate nearly three years ago.\n\nNearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the United Nations.\n\nAlthough the loss of Mosul would deal a major defeat to Islamic State, U.S. and Iraqi officials are preparing for smaller battles even after the city is recaptured and expect the group to go underground to fight as a traditional insurgency.\n\nWhat happens to the U.S. military role in Iraq after Mosul is recaptured remain unclear.\n\nInfluential Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has previously called on Iraq's government to order the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces after the battle of Mosul is over.\n\nDunford said Abadi understood the need for continued U.S. military support.\n\n\"It's not our judgment that the Iraqis will be self sustaining and self sufficient in the wake of Mosul. More importantly, it's not Prime Minister Abadi's assessment,\" Dunford said before his talks.\n\nAcross the border in Syria, a U.S.-backed campaign to isolate Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa is advancing ahead of an eventual assault on the city.\n\nBut in Syria, too, tough decisions await Trump.\n\nNATO ally Turkey has been incensed by U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, seen by the U.S. military as a reliable partner but by Turkey as a hostile force with deep links to Kurdish PKK militants who have waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state.\n\nThe U.S. military has said no decision has been made yet on whether to support the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which include the YPG, in the Raqqa assault.\n\n(additional reporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Giles Elgood)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kushner-idUSKBN17515U"}, {"title": "Trump donates first-quarter salary to National Park Service", "text": "National Park Service Superintendent Tyrone Brandyburg (C) and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke hold a check donated by U.S. President Donald Trump salary to the National Park Service as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (R) holds a daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2017.

In a statement, the Montana lawmaker said Gorsuch was \"smart\" but added: \"That doesn't make him right for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\n\nIf the planned filibuster holds, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell would only be able to advance the nomination of Gorsuch by changing long-standing Senate rules so it could be approved by a simple majority.\n\nMcConnell, who also appeared on \"Meet the Press,\" declined to rule out that option, which the Republican president has urged, and vowed the Senate would confirm Gorsuch one way or another.\n\n\"What I can tell you is Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week. How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends,\" he said.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote on the nomination on Monday, setting the stage for what McConnell has said will be a vote in the full Senate on Friday.\n\nMcConnell declined to say if he had sufficient support among his fellow Republicans to change the Senate's rules.\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder and Mike Stone; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-gorsuch-idUSKBN1740NH"}, {"title": "Democrat Senator Jon Tester will vote against Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch", "text": "Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 1, 2017.

Little information was given on several of his assets and only indicated they were worth more than $1 million.\n\nCohn had income ranging from $48 million to nearly $77 million in the year preceding his engagement in the White House, though it could be much higher.\n\nJared Kushner\u2019s 54-page report \u2013 which included most of the assets and income of his wife Ivanka Trump - included scores of assets worth six- and seven-figures.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the couple\u2019s real estate and investment empire was worth as much as $741 million. Kushner held executive positions with 266 LLCs, corporations, groups and non-profits, which he has resigned from since January.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Kushner, who like Trump is a New York real estate developer.\n\nTrump this week officially added his daughter Ivanka to his staff.

About $566,000 of his income came from the Republican National Committee and the rest from his partnership in a Milwaukee law firm.\n\nNeither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence's assets were included in the documents.\n\nTrump has faced questions about conflicts of interest with his hotel and golf course businesses since his election in November. He has handed off control to his two oldest sons, but ethics watchdogs have complained that the arrangements do not go far enough to avoid conflicts, and have urged Trump to divest fully or set up a blind trust for his assets.\n\nCOMPLEX ASSETS\n\nTrump, a real estate magnate and television celebrity with no political experience before he was elected president, has brought in some high-net-worth people to advise him.\n\nFor example, Reed Cordish, a Baltimore real estate developer before he become Trump's technology adviser, disclosed pre-White House assets of between $92 million and $798 million. He had income of between $48 million and $55 million.\n\n\"These are incredibly successful individuals, very high-net worth, very sophisticated complex asset structures, numerous sub LLCs, trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through,\" a senior White House ethics official told reporters before the data was released.\n\nWealthy senior White House staff have to enter into ethics agreements where they agree to resign from positions and divest from assets. Copies of those agreements were not available.\n\nThe White House said the independent Office of Government Ethics, which reviews financial disclosures to help executive branch officials avoid conflicts of interest, has classified about 25 percent of Trump White House staffers as having \"extremely complex\" reports, meaning the filers are very wealthy.\n\nIn contrast, only a sliver of the staffers in former Democrat President Barack Obama's White House fell into the \"extremely complex\" category, according to pie charts released by the White House. No numbers accompanied the charts.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the Obama White House filers had disclosure statements that were rated \"simple\" or \"moderate\" while only a third of the Trump filers were in those categories.\n\nNot all of Trump's advisers were gold-plated before joining the government. Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade adviser, earned a relatively modest $240,000 from University of California-Irvine, with less than $1,000 in royalties from the book \u201cDeath by China\u201d in the past year, and speaking fees from the Casket and Funeral Supply Association and other groups.\n\nOmarosa Manigault, who rose to fame on Trump's reality show the Apprentice and now is a White House adviser, had a modest income under $100,000. The disclosures showed she is a beneficiary of a trust established by her late fiance, actor Michael Clarke Duncan, worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nManigault is currently engaged to a Florida pastor.

Senate Republicans are hoping to vote on April 7 to confirm the conservative appeals court judge nominated by the Republican president in January.\n\nDemocratic Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii came out against Gorsuch on Friday and backed a filibuster.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48. But if Democrats can muster 41 votes, they would be able to sustain the filibuster. As of Friday afternoon, 36 Democrats had indicated their support for such a move. Two Democrats have said they support Gorsuch. Another two have voiced opposition to Gorsuch but have not made clear whether they would support a filibuster to block a confirmation vote.\n\nSeven Democrats and one independent, Angus King of Maine, who usually votes with them, have not yet announced their position.\n\nIf Democrats amass enough support to block a confirmation vote, it would force Republican Senate leaders to try to change the chamber's long-standing rules and allow confirmation by a simple majority, a move backed by Trump that is sometimes called the \"nuclear option.\"\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch would reinstate the nine-seat high court's conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House.\n\nMcCaskill said in a statement she could not support Gorsuch because a study of his legal opinions revealed \"a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations.\"\n\nMcCaskill is up for re-election next year in a state Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBlumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee that held a four-day confirmation hearing last week and will vote on sending the nomination to the Senate floor on Monday, said in a statement Gorsuch has not been forthcoming with senators about his views on key issues, leaving his core beliefs little known.\n\n\"Instead he has evaded real answers at every turn,\" Blumenthal said. \"We must assume that Judge Gorsuch has passed the Trump litmus test - a pro-life, pro-gun, conservative judge.\"\n\nBlumenthal said Gorsuch's refusal to \"distance himself from right-wing groups\" raised questions about whether he may be \"an acolyte of hard-right special interests.\"\n\nSchatz said Gorsuch's record as a judge was troubling and he had not shown he would challenge executive overreach.\n\n\"His refusal to answer questions on long-decided cases or condemn attacks on the judiciary during the hearing demonstrates that he is outside of the legal mainstream,\" Schatz said.\n\nTheir statements came one day after Gorsuch won his first Democratic support, giving Republicans who control the chamber two of the eight Democratic votes they need to break a filibuster.\n\nSenators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Democrats who face re-election in states that voted for Trump last year, said they would vote for Gorsuch.\n\nTrump made the appointment of conservative jurists to the Supreme Court a key promise during the 2016 presidential election.

REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nBRUSSELS U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reassured his nervous European counterparts over Washington's commitment to NATO on Friday and pressed them again to spend more on defense, triggering a rebuke from Germany.\n\nForeign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was neither \"reachable nor desirable\" for Germany to spend the agreed NATO target of two percent of member states' economic output on defense. NATO allies have until 2024 to do that.\n\n\"Two percent would mean military expenses of some 70 billion euros. I don't know any German politician who would claim that is reachable nor desirable,\" Gabriel told the first meeting of NATO foreign ministers attended by Tillerson.\n\n\"The United States will realize it is better to talk about better spending instead of more spending,\" he said, noting that humanitarian, development and economic aid to stabilize countries and regions should also count.\n\nIn his first remarks to NATO ministers, Tillerson said allies needed to pay up or outline plans for meeting that target when NATO leaders meet on May 25 for the first top-level summit of the alliance to be attended by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has criticized NATO as \"obsolete\" and suggested Washington's security guarantees for European allies could be conditional on them spending more on their own defense. He has also said he wants NATO to do more to fight terrorism.\n\n\"Our goal should be to agree at the May leaders meeting that by the end of the year all allies will have either met the pledge guidelines or will have developed plans that clearly articulate how...the pledge will be fulfilled,\" Tillerson said.\n\n\"Allies must demonstrate by their actions that they share U.S. government's commitment.\"\n\nIn Berlin, German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the government was committed to increasing defense spending and would continue to do so \"because we know it is necessary and makes sense to further strengthen our armed forces\".\n\nU.S. defense expenditure makes up about 70 percent of the total NATO allies' defense spending. Only four European NATO members - Estonia, Greece, Poland and Britain - meet the two-percent target.\n\nNATO head Jens Stoltenberg rejected Gabriel's call to include non-military spending toward the goal, but said Germany was moving \"in the right direction\" with more military spending after years of cuts.\n\nHe said NATO ministers on Friday discussed national plans for arriving at the target as they prepared for the May summit.\n\nIn London, Britain's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that other European NATO allies must \"raise their game, and those failing to meet the two-percent commitment... should at least agree to year-on-year real terms increases.\"\n\nQUESTIONS OVER U.S. COMMITMENT\n\nTillerson did, however, offer assurances of Washington's commitment to NATO during his brief stop in Brussels, where he did not hold one-on-one meetings with countries, which is customary during such gatherings.\n\nHis initial decision to skip his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers had added to questions about the Trump administration's commitment. The meeting was later rescheduled and he attended on Friday.\n\n\"The United States is committed to ensuring NATO has the capabilities to support our collective defense,\" Tillerson said. \"We will uphold the agreements we have made to defend our allies.\"\n\nTillerson said NATO was fundamental to countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and said the United States would hold Moscow accountable to its commitments under a two-year Minsk ceasefire deal. He pledged to keep sanctions in place against Moscow until it complies with the Minsk agreement.\n\nTrump has said in the past that, as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia, he is prepared to review the sanctions, which were imposed by Barack Obama over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula.\n\n\"We do not, and will not, accept Russian efforts to change the borders of territory of Ukraine,\" Tillerson said according to a transcript of his remarks.\n\n\"The United States sanctions will remain until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered our sanctions,\" he added, expressing alarm at a surge in violence along the front lines in eastern Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg said ties between European NATO members and the United States were \"rock solid\".\n\nHe said \"fair burden sharing to keep the trans-atlantic bond strong\" and \"stepping up NATO efforts to project stability and fight terrorism\" were on the agenda on Friday as the bloc seeks to respond to the new, harsher tone from across the Atlantic.\n\n(Additional reporting by Tom Koerkemeier in Brussels, Andrea Shalal in Berlin and Kylie MacLellan in London; Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Louise Ireland and Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-idUSKBN1720WV"}, {"title": "Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 31 at 6:19 p.m. EDT", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to journalists at the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S. March 24, 2017.

It said these include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property or that do not conduct research or make products in China.\n\nThe report also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003.\n\n(Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd and Michael Martina in Beijing and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast and James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-idUSKBN17215W"}, {"title": "Factbox: Most Democrats oppose Trump Supreme Court pick, but not all", "text": "U.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Neil Gorsuch takes a drink while testifying during the third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2017.

Republican Senate leaders hope to confirm Gorsuch on April 7.\n\nAs of Friday morning, 37 of the 46 Democrats and the two independents who align with them in the 100-seat Senate have publicly announced opposition to Gorsuch.

The stance of these law enforcement officials conforms with advice from the state's two most recent attorneys general.\n\nThese and other \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions that opt not to cooperate with federal immigration agents have drawn fire from conservative Republicans. On Monday, Sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars in U.S. funding for cities that fail to assist immigration authorities.\n\nIn their letter, Kelly and Sessions said agents make arrests at courthouses rather than other public places in part because visitors are screened for weapons before entering, as they are at jails.\n\nThey were responding to a letter sent two weeks ago by Cantil-Sakauye, who asked the two Cabinet officials to stop immigration agents from arresting undocumented immigrants inside California courthouses.\n\n\"Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country's immigration law,\" she wrote.\n\nThe presence of immigration agents in courthouses in the nation's most populous state could undermine public trust in its judicial system, she said.\n\nHer letter went on to say that immigration agents were \"stalking undocumented immigrants\" at courthouses, language that drew a sharp rebuke from Sessions and Kelly.\n\nThey said the use of the word \"stalking\" suggested criminal conduct.

But it has yet to appoint people with the skills to evaluate complex tax laws, draft legislation and sell it to deeply divided lawmakers.\n\nBurned by last week's failed healthcare measure largely authored by House of Representatives Republicans, Trump is determined not to count on Congress so much this time for handling the details on taxes, his second major legislative initiative.\n\nBut that only underscores his need for a strong White House tax team, which the administration still lacks. Many policy options are still being studied, from deficit-funded tax cuts to a European-style value-added tax.\n\n\"They're still sorting out who's in charge, who's going to take the lead,\" said William Hoagland, a longtime Senate Republican aide who worked on the last successful comprehensive tax reform effort in 1986.\n\n\"You need someone who has the ear and support of the president who can sell a tax plan, and you need the technical support for that person,\u201d said Hoagland, now senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.\n\nFinancial markets have been reassessing expectations of fast action on taxes that have helped fuel a Trump stocks rally.\n\nMembers of Trump's tax team are known, but not their exact duties. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are senior team leaders. Others include White House advisers Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nTrump huddled with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss taxes.\n\n\u201cWe are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday, Trump's 69th day in office.\n\nWhen Trump was elected in November, Republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle Obamacare in the first 100 days of his presidency.\n\nIn early February, Trump promised a \"phenomenal\" tax plan by early March that never appeared. Mnuchin spoke on Feb. 23 of enacting tax reform by August. Spicer acknowledged this week that the timetable could be slipping.\n\nAnother senior White House official said the administration had assumed it would still be working on healthcare at this point, not tax reform yet. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nSo far, Trump's tax campaign is a far cry from President Ronald Reagan's 1986 effort, in which Don Regan, as Treasury secretary and then White House chief of staff, spent many months developing legislation that won bipartisan support in Congress.\n\n\"The process under Reagan was much more developed, elaborate and long, and there was a strong bench of top-rate technicians putting things together,\" said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank.\n\nUnder Trump, he said, \"None of that is happening.\"\n\n'A LOT SIMPLER'\n\nDuring the 2016 election campaign, Trump issued a tax plan that partly resembled one developed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, but Trump does not now appear wedded to either. It is a safe bet he will not lean heavily on the plan from Ryan, who drafted and championed the ill-fated plan to gut Obamacare.\n\n\"Trump now desperately needs a policy victory ... I would expect the president to play a much more activist role,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a think tank. Moore helped write the Trump campaign tax plan.\n\nMnuchin last week talked about a middle-class tax cut. He also said tax reform in many ways would be \"a lot simpler\" than healthcare, dismaying tax experts who said that is not so.\n\nComprehensive tax reform is so complex that it has defied Congresses and presidents since Reagan. Tax law is riddled with loopholes embedded in the economy and defended by beneficiaries.\n\nSome fundamental questions remain unanswered within the Trump team. For instance, it is unclear if Trump would support a plan that adds to the budget deficit. Past tax reform efforts have tried to be \"revenue neutral.\"\n\nTrump also has sent mixed messages on Ryan's proposed \"border adjustment tax\" that would end the corporate deduction for import costs and make export income tax-free, aiming to boost exports and raise new tax revenues.\n\nThe Trump team is heavy on Wall Street experience, but short on tax expertise. At Treasury, Mnuchin is the only Senate-confirmed political appointee in place. The job of Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy is unfilled.\n\nA person familiar with the hiring process for the job said: \"Treasury needs more capable tax expertise ASAP, or the White House will yank total control for tax reform from the department for the rest of the year, maybe beyond.\"\n\nMark Mazur, who held the Treasury tax job under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said Mnuchin has too much on his plate to concentrate fully on taxes.\n\nMnuchin has praised Treasury's 100 tax policy career staff, but they can only offer options to Trump appointees, said Mazur, now director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\n\"The political appointees are the ones who need to turn the crank on the sausage-making machine,\" Mazur said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-trump-idUSKBN1722PX"}, {"title": "Trump seeks to 'reboot' U.S. relationship with Egypt in Monday talks", "text": "President Trump speaks at a Women's Empowerment Panel at the East Room of the White House in Washington.

The country is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai, and hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting insurgents.\n\nThe bilateral relationship was strained when former President Barack Obama criticized Sisi for cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist group.\n\nSisi does not make a distinction between the Brotherhood, which says it is peaceful, and Islamic State militants. Egypt considers the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group.\n\nObama froze aid to the country for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi's rule. Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year.\n\nHuman rights groups have estimated that at least 40,000 political prisoners have been detained by Sisi's government.\n\nTrump's relationship with Sisi got off to a good start when they met last September in New York while Trump was running for president, the White House said.\n\nTrump supports Sisi's approach to counterterrorism, which includes both military and political efforts, his efforts to reform Egypt's economy, and Sisi's calls for \"reform and moderation of Islamic discourse,\" the official said.\n\nAsked whether the United States would designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, as Egypt has, the official said Trump was interested in hearing Sisi's views during the meeting.\n\n\"We, along with a number of countries, have some concerns about various activities that the Muslim Brotherhood has conducted in the region,\" the official said.\n\n'MORE DISCREET WAY'\n\nSisi's visit comes as the Trump administration has proposed massive cuts to U.S. foreign aid, the details of which are still to be determined.

The Trump administration intends to address human rights issues behind closed doors, the White House official said.\n\n\"Our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private, more discreet way. We believe it's the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome,\" the official said.\n\nThe official would not say whether Trump would discuss with Sisi the case of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American who works with street children and was arrested in May 2014 on human trafficking charges. Rights groups have called for her release.\n\nHijazi has been held in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months.\n\nA verdict was set to be read in a March 23 court session, but was postponed with no reason stated by the judge until April 16. The maximum possible jail sentence in her case is 25 years.\n\nThe White House is aware of Hijazi's case \"at the most senior levels,\" the official told reporters.\n\n\"We are going to address this with Egypt in a way that we think maximizes the chances her case will be resolved in a satisfactory way,\" the official said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Cairo; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-egypt-idUSKBN17227M"}, {"title": "Ex-Trump adviser Flynn talking to Congress about testifying in Russia probe: lawyer", "text": "((In March 30 item, corrects spelling of Kislyak in paragraph 3))\n\nWASHINGTON Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has offered to testify before congressional committees probing potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia but wants protection against \"unfair prosecution,\" his lawyer said on Thursday.\n\n\"General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,\" said a statement from Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner.\n\nTestimony from Flynn could help shed light on the conversations he had with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak last year when he was the national security adviser for Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nKelner said discussions had taken place about Flynn's availability to testify with officials of the intelligence committees of both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.

They include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property (IP) or that do not conduct research or manufacture products in China.\n\n\"China also reportedly conditions foreign investment approvals on technology transfer to Chinese entities, mandates adverse licensing terms on foreign IP licensors, uses anti-monopoly laws to extract technology on unreasonable terms and subsidizes acquisition of foreign high technology firms to bring technology to the Chinese parent companies.\"\n\nGaps in IP rights enforcement have allowed the misappropriation of foreign IP and trade secrets, both within and outside of China.\n\nUSTR's criticisms are consistent with increasingly vocal concerns raised by international business groups about what they see as a worsening business climate for foreign firms in China, as well as China's goal to boost domestic manufacturing content in 10 sectors from robotics to biopharmaceuticals.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union Chamber of Commerce said the \"Made in China 2025\" plan amounts to a \"large-scale import substitution plan aimed at nationalizing key industries\" or \"severely curtailing the position of foreign business.\"\n\nUSTR also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003.\n\nIt said delays in China's approval process for agricultural products derived from biotechnology also worsened in 2016, hurting U.S. corn exports.\n\nRoss, the commerce secretary, also said Trump will sign two executive orders on Friday.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo\n\n(This March 30 story was corrected to note Prieto says Wisniewski, not Prieto, was acting for political reasons in paragraph 13)\n\nBy Joseph Ax\n\nNEW YORK A day after two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were sentenced to prison in the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, a state lawmaker who helped uncover the scheme to cause massive traffic jams over a political slight wants to keep pushing for answers to the two biggest unanswered questions.\n\nWhat did the governor know about the lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, and when did he know it?\n\nTo learn the truth, the legislature's Bridgegate probe should be resumed, with Christie subpoenaed and required to testify, said Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who co-chaired a special committee that unearthed the damning emails and texts revealing the plot. He also is campaigning to replace Christie as governor.\n\nBut fellow Democratic leaders in the state legislature offered a lukewarm response, saying it was not clear what further investigation would accomplish.\n\nBridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was sentenced on Wednesday to 1-1/2 years in prison. Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, got a prison sentence of two years.\n\nAlong with David Wildstein, another former Port Authority executive who pleaded guilty, they are the only officials charged in connection with the shutdown of access lanes at the bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in September 2013.\n\nThe resulting traffic nightmare was intended to punish the town's Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for declining to endorse Christie's re-election campaign.\n\nChristie has denied any involvement, but the fallout damaged his unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign and saddled him with historically low approval ratings at home. A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nAt trial, numerous witnesses, including close Christie advisers, testified that the governor and his inner circle were aware of the lane closures much earlier than they admitted publicly. Following her sentencing, Kelly said she refused to be a \"scapegoat\" and vowed to fight her conviction.\n\nThe criminal case might never have existed had it not been for the legislative committee, which used its subpoena power to secure communications between Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein. Those documents included the now-infamous email from Kelly to Wildstein saying, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\"\n\n\"We need to follow the facts wherever they go,\" Wisniewski said in a phone interview. He noted that Christie previously invoked executive privilege to avoid turning over texts and emails in what he called a \"Nixonian\" move.\n\nBut the assembly speaker, Democrat Vincent Prieto, said in a statement it was \"unlikely after the federal trial that additional hearings or subpoenas will provide new information.\"\n\nPrieto, whose approval would be needed to set up a new committee, also criticized Wisniewski for sending out a campaign statement calling for a renewed investigation, saying Wisniewski was using the issue for political reasons.\n\nChristie cannot run for another term this year due to term limits.\n\nWisniewski, however, said leaving the investigation half-finished would allow such abuses to occur again.\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a longtime Christie foe who co-chaired the investigative committee, said she had \"mixed feelings\" about further action.\n\n\"I'm not sure what our goal would be,\" Weinberg, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. She said it was not clear whether the legislature could force Christie to testify under oath or gain access to his communications.\n\nChristie's status as a lame-duck governor is another factor weighing against a renewed probe, as is the potential cost to taxpayers, Weinberg said.\n\nThe target of the scheme, Sokolich, the Fort Lee mayor, said it was obvious the plot extended beyond the three charged defendants.\n\n\"There were many others who were half a text or one email conversation away from getting indicted,\" he said, adding that Christie has already been found guilty in the court of public opinion.\n\n\"I guess we'll never know for sure,\" Sokolich said. \"Welcome to Jersey politics.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by David Gregorio and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-jersey-bridgegate-idUSKBN171352"}, {"title": "U.S. diplomatic delays, Trump agenda snarl Italy's G7 agenda", "text": "ROME Italy's preparations for hosting this year's Group of Seven major powers meetings have been hampered by the slow transition at the U.S. State Department, which has created decision-making bottlenecks, European diplomatic sources said.\n\nThe G7 draws together the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, with countries taking it in turn to draw up agendas that they see as of pressing concern.\n\nItaly holds the 2017 presidency and its objectives laid out this week appeared to put Rome on a collision course with U.S. President Donald Trump by promoting highly sensitive topics such as climate change, free trade and immigration initiatives.\n\nThe G7 foreign ministers meet in Tuscany on April 10-11, preparing for a leaders' summit in Sicily at the end of May.\n\nHowever, officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said efforts to reach an agreement on statements and strategy ahead of time - a normal part of pre-meeting G7 diplomacy - were going slowly.\n\nThe immediate concerns lay with the State Department, where new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has left vacant numerous positions seen as vital to drafting summit accords.\n\n\"It's very difficult to talk to someone who can give a straight answer because the ones who are there are 'acting' head of something and they're not even very senior,\" said a senior Italian government official involved in G7 diplomacy.\n\nThe White House has yet to nominate candidates for either of the two deputy secretary of state slots, beneath Tillerson. Further down the chain, all six of the department's regional bureaus are led by acting assistant secretaries of state, while Trump has yet to appoint ambassadors to Italy or the Vatican.\n\n\"This has made it extremely difficult for us to prepare for the meeting,\" the government official added.\n\nA State Department official acknowledged that some positions had yet to be filled, but said that it was preparing for a \"successful\" series of G7 meetings.\n\n\"We continue to have a deep bench of experienced and capable staff members serving in key positions and working closely with their G7 counterparts, including our Italian hosts,\" the official said.\n\nA diplomat in another European capital also involved in G7 preparations said the department heads beneath the secretary of state were vital for getting approval for agendas, scheduling and the often delicate wording of policy statements.\n\n\"We no longer know who to talk to. It is slowing everything down,\" he said, adding that any ambitious projects would struggle to take off given the confusion.\n\nA senior diplomat in a third EU capital said: \"Since President Trump took office, it has become very difficult to deal with the State Department on planning and we are still learning to work with that.\"\n\nNO FUNDING\n\nThe senior Italian diplomat leading behind-the-scenes G7 discussions, Raffaele Trombetta, said this week that Africa would play a prominent role in Italy's summit agenda, with seven African leaders invited to join the talks in Sicily.\n\nHowever, in a sign that Rome was lowering expectations for this year's event, the Italian government was unlikely to launch any major funding initiative at a time when Trump is looking to slash back on U.S. foreign aid.\n\n\"Usually the G7 sets aside money for a particular cause, but this time it doesn't look like there's the will to do it. It's not just the Americans. The Japanese don't want one either,\" said the Italian government source.\n\nTrombetta said \"trust\" was the presidency slogan - trust between governments and their citizens, and between countries.\n\n\"There is also a need of renewed trust between the leaders who will be attending the summit,\" he said, noting that the prime ministers of Britain and Italy and the presidents of France and the United States would be attending their first G7.\n\nEU leaders worry Trump might undermine 70 years of strong trans-Atlantic ties and have been alarmed by his criticism of NATO, his support for trade protectionism, his rejection of climate change policies, and his anti-migrant rhetoric.\n\nFlying into these headwinds, Trombetta said Italy wanted the G7 to reaffirm the importance of the 2015 Paris agreement, which obliges nations to curb global warming and which senior White House advisers have called on Trump to renounce.\n\nRome was also eager for a commitment \"to fighting all forms of protectionism\", said Trombetta. However, he acknowledged that this might be hard to achieve, with the United States this month already breaking with a tradition of endorsing open trade at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Germany.\n\n\"It is a highly political issue. I expect it will go up to the leaders. It will be dealt with by them at the Taormina summit ... It will be one of the main points of tension of our presidency,\" he said.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni is flying to the United States next month, in part to seek an understanding with Trump on the G7 agenda ahead of the Sicily summit.\n\nBut if Trump pushes back, he is unlikely to face strong resistance from Italy, which has made good relations with the United States the cornerstone of its foreign policy.\n\n\"We can argue with France, Germany and Britain, but never with America,\" said another senior government official, who was not authorized to talk to the media. \"We will do with Trump what we always do (with the Americans); find a way to get along with him.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Yeganeh Torbati in Washington,; Robin Emmott in Brussels; editing by Giles Elgood)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-italy-idUSKBN172183"}, {"title": "Tillerson says U.S. committed to NATO in first alliance meeting", "text": "BRUSSELS U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in his first NATO meeting in Brussels, told allies that the United States will uphold previous agreements and ensure the alliance has the capability to defend itself, including from Russian aggression.\n\nHe also pressed allies to meet a defense spending goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product, urging each country to either meet or have a plan in place to fulfill funding commitments to NATO by a May summit of NATO leaders.\n\n(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-usa-tillerson-idUSKBN17218Z"}, {"title": "Britain and U.S. tell NATO allies to 'raise their game' on defense spending", "text": "U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Britain's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon shake hands before their meeting in London, March 31, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/File Photo\n\nNorth Carolina on Thursday repealed a law restricting bathroom use for transgender people, hoping to bring back businesses and sports leagues that boycotted the Southern state because they saw the year-old measure as discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the new law replacing the old one bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020, drawing scorn from civil rights advocates and casting doubt on whether boycotting businesses will return to the state.\n\nDemocratic Governor Roy Cooper signed the replacement bill into law after the Republican-controlled state Senate and House of Representatives approved it in separate votes in the capital, Raleigh.\n\nThe new measure rescinds House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill also popularly known as HB 2, which required transgender people to use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers in state-run buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.\n\nHB 2's enactment a year ago prompted boycotts that cost the state economy hundreds of millions of dollars. Deutsche Bank AG and PayPal Holdings Inc reversed expansion plans in the state. Entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman canceled concerts.\n\nIn basketball-crazed North Carolina, the withdrawal of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament games and the National Basketball Association All-Star game, which had been awarded to Charlotte, reverberated throughout the state.\n\nUnder the new law, transgender people are once again free to use the bathroom of their choice, but they lack any recourse should a person, business or state entity eject or harass them.\n\nThe new law also denies LGBT people state legal protections in other areas such as employment and housing.\n\nOutraged LGBT advocates, who had wanted an unconditional repeal of HB 2, were already pressuring business and sports organizations not to return.\n\n\"This (is) the end of HB 2 in name only.

Both Cooper and the Republican House speaker said they expected the NCAA to once again schedule championship events.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert said at a news conference posted online by the Raleigh News and Observer newspaper that the board of directors would decide whether the change is sufficient to spur a return.\n\nThe deal to replace HB 2 came together on Wednesday night, just ahead of an NCAA deadline to amend the law.\n\nThe governor told reporters the law was imperfect but said Thursday's action would help begin repairing North Carolina's damaged reputation.\n\n\"I wish this were a complete, total repeal, and whenever I get the chance to do that I will do that. ... I'm going to fight every single day for LGBT protections,\" Cooper said.\n\nHB 2 was passed in response to an ordinance in Charlotte, the state's largest city, that permitted transgender people to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. The Charlotte ordinance alarmed social conservatives who, without evidence, feared it would endanger women and girls in intimate spaces.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore said the new state law protected bathroom safety, but some social conservatives were unsatisfied.\n\n\"The truth remains, no basketball game, corporation, or entertainment event is worth even one little girl losing her privacy and dignity to a boy in the locker room, or being harmed or frightened in a bathroom,\" said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition in Raleigh and an outspoken supporter of HB 2.\n\nCooper, the former state attorney general, has opposed HB 2 from the outset.

We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning.\n\nHe later singled out three Freedom Caucus members by name, U.S. Representatives Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Raul Labrador.\n\n\"If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform,\" he said in one tweet.\n\n\"Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador?\n\n#RepealANDReplace #Obamacare,\" he asked in another.\n\nHouse conservatives fought back.\n\nLabrador, one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, urged Trump in a tweet to \"Remember who your real friends are. We're trying to help you succeed.\"\n\n\"Most people don't take well to being bullied,\" said Representative Justin Amash, who compared Trump's approach to what a child does when he wants to \"get his way.\"\n\nTrump's deteriorating relationship with Republican House conservatives could make it harder for him to pass his legislative agenda, which includes rewriting the U.S. tax code, revisiting a healthcare overhaul and funding construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nTrump, a New York businessman who touted his skills as a dealmaker in his bid for the White House, has repeatedly criticized Freedom Caucus members, blaming them for the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.\n\nFreedom Caucus members said the bill did not go far enough to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nAsked during a briefing whether Trump's tweet about the Freedom Caucus was a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said: \"No, it's a math strategy, which is to get to 216,\" the number of votes currently needed to pass House legislation.\n\nThe discord following the healthcare debacle was not limited to tensions between Trump and the Freedom Caucus. In recent days, the president has been out of sync with the two highest ranking Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump and his aides have suggested reviving the push for a healthcare bill. While Ryan expressed openness to the idea, McConnell said he thought doing so would be futile.\n\nBut Ryan publicly disagreed with Trump when the president offered to work with Democrats on new healthcare legislation.\n\n\"I don't want that to happen,\" the speaker told CBS in an interview aired on Thursday.\n\n'NOT AN IDEAL POSITION'\n\nMore than healthcare legislation was at stake.\n\nRepublican lawmakers still await key details on what Trump's priorities are in the monumental tax reform effort they want to launch.\n\nPassing a budget for next year could also prove challenging. Trump and the Freedom Caucus want to dramatically shrink domestic programs. Moderate Republicans are aghast at proposals to cut popular programs that fund environmental cleanup and meals for senior citizens.\n\nMost pressing is an April 28 deadline for approving new funding to keep the government running.\n\n\"The GOP (Republican) House is riven by factions that are quite ideological. Trump is not,\" said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato. \"And let's throw in the fact that Trump is unpopular and weak and has no Democratic support in Congress.\n\n\"Add all this up. Neither Trump nor congressional Republicans are in an ideal position to govern, and that's an understatement,\" Sabato said.\n\nThere are about three dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus, comprising about 15 percent of the 237 House Republicans. But their clout is larger, as Trump and Ryan cannot afford to lose too many House Republicans if they want to try to pass bills, like the Obamacare repeal, that attract zero Democratic support.\n\nDan Meyer, a legislative affairs chief to former Republican President George W. Bush, said that with the Freedom Caucus threatening Trump's agenda, the White House either had to find a way to work with the conservatives, or tack to the left.\n\nSome Republicans were so furious they were publicly saying things usually reserved for closed-door meetings.\n\nRepresentative Chris Collins, a Trump ally and part of the \"Tuesday Group\" of moderate Republicans, told reporters his group was so angry with the Freedom Caucus that it would \"never\" meet with it. He accused its members of trying to shift blame for the healthcare failure to moderates.\n\nSENATORS CRINGE\n\nSenate Republicans expressed alarm and urged efforts at consensus.\n\nSenator John McCain, who ran for president in 2008 and was defeated by Obama, said that if he were sitting in the White House, he would try to ease intraparty tensions rather than stoking them.\n\n\"But that's the president,\" said McCain who sometimes is at odds with Trump. He added this advice to Trump: \"Sit down with them and say this is an emergency situation.\"\n\nSenator Cory Gardner, a Republican who served in the House from 2011 to 2014, said his former colleagues needed to quit arguing and come to a consensus \"sooner rather than later.\"\n\nA senior House Republican aide distanced Ryan from Trump's strategy of upbraiding conservatives.\n\n\"Ryan ... is never going to intentionally alienate a large swath of his caucus,\" said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nPublicly, Ryan said he understood Trump's frustration.\n\nThe speaker also said he was encouraging Republican lawmakers \"to keep talking to one another.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker chided Ryan, however, for his views about courting Democrats on healthcare reform.\n\n\"We have come a long way in our country when the speaker of one party urges a president NOT to work with the other party to solve a problem,\" Corker wrote on Twitter.\n\n(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, David Morgan, Roberta Rampton, Tim Ahmann, David Alexander and Steve Holland; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN1711UI"}, {"title": "U.S. appeals injunction of Trump revised travel order", "text": "Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin talks to the media at the U.S. District Court Ninth Circuit after seeking an extension after filing an amended lawsuit against President Donald Trump's new travel ban in Honolulu, Hawaii, March 29, 2017.

But almost two-thirds of that would go to those earning more than $500,000, even though they bear just over one-half of the total tax burden.\n\n\"We already have astounding wealth gaps across the city and across the country,\" Stringer told a news conference. \"The Trump tax code, if implemented, would only exacerbate it.\"\n\nThe lower taxes for wealthier residents would be achieved through lower marginal tax rates on ordinary and capital gains income and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (AMT).\n\nLast week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's objective is a tax cut for the middle class, not the top 1 percent. He said he is aiming for passage of a comprehensive tax overhaul by the time Congress takes its August recess.\n\nStringer's office analyzed tax returns of 365,000 New York City households. It found that 92 percent of the city's millionaires would receive, on average, a tax cut of at least $113,000.\n\nNearly half of single parents who make $25,000 to $50,000 would experience a tax increase, it said.\n\nThe tax cuts, which would reduce federal revenue by more than $2 trillion over 10 years, are driving proposed budget cuts that would leave the city, home to 60,000 homeless people, with a weakened social safety net, Stringer said.\n\n\"I find it incredible that this guy, who comes from New York City, who has major investments here, can't see what his proposal will do to his hometown,\" he said. \"And then when you scratch the surface, you realize that part of his agenda and who benefits from it is Donald Trump himself.\"\n\nBased on the limited information available from Trump's now-public 2005 federal tax return, his proposal to eliminate the AMT would have benefited him by $31 million that year. In contrast, under his tax plan, a single mother raising two children on less than $50,000 a year would face a tax increase of $464.\n\n(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Additional reporting by Peter Szekely; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-new-york-idUSKBN1712Z7"}, {"title": "High court pick could help decide fate of Trump's climate policy", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Neil Gorsuch responds to a question as he testifies during the third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. on March 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee could help decide the fate of his moves to undo climate-related U.S. regulations, but legal experts said Neil Gorsuch's judicial record makes it hard to predict whether as a justice he would back a sweeping rollback.\n\nIf confirmed to the lifetime job by the Senate, the Colorado-based federal appeals court judge would restore the court's 5-4 conservative majority. The Senate is planning an April 7 confirmation vote although many Democrats are fighting to block Gorsuch.\n\nOn the court, Gorsuch could become a pivotal vote on the Republican president's deregulation agenda, along with fellow conservative Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes joins the court's four liberals in close cases.\n\nThat agenda includes Trump's effort to kill Democratic former President Barack Obama's so-called Clean Power Plan, blocked by the high court last year, aimed at reducing climate-warming carbon emissions from mainly coal-fired power plants. Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order kicking off a lengthy review process that environmental groups and Democratic-governed U.S. states have promised to challenge in court.\n\nGorsuch's views on issues related to climate change are unclear. His mother headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Republican former President Ronald Reagan for two years in the 1980s.\n\nGorsuch was not asked about climate issues during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing last week. In his 11 years as a judge, the only major ruling touching upon climate policy came in 2015 when he was on a three-judge panel that upheld a Colorado measure requiring power generators to ensure a fifth of their electricity came from renewable sources.\n\nA 2016 case on federal agency power is potentially more instructive on how he might approach broad moves to slash current regulation, according to experts.\n\nIn that case, Gorsuch questioned a 1984 Supreme Court precedent giving federal agencies broad deference to interpret laws. Gorsuch called the doctrine, enshrined in the Chevron v. Natural Resource Defense Council ruling, an \"elephant in the room\" that concentrates federal power \"in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\"\n\nQuestions remain over how that approach would manifest itself if applied to efforts by Trump's EPA to weaken or rescind existing agency regulations on fighting climate change. Some environmental lawyers say it could mean Gorsuch would be skeptical of any big changes at the agency level. The EPA under Obama compiled detailed scientific data to support its efforts to curb carbon emissions.\n\n\"That could hamper the Trump administration,\" said Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland.\n\nSean Donahue, a lawyer who represents environmental groups, agreed, saying if the EPA were to \"advance fancy interpretive footwork to try to make greenhouse gases not a Clean Air Act pollutant,\" the administration may not get the deference it wants.\n\nThe extent to which the U.S. Clean Air Act, the law that tackles air pollution, applies to carbon emissions is heavily contested in the courts. The Supreme Court, in the landmark 2007 decision Massachusetts v. EPA, held that carbon is a pollutant that could be subject to regulation under the law.\n\nIn a 2014 case, the court largely upheld the Obama administration's first batch of greenhouse gas regulations.\n\nEnvironmental groups including the Sierra Club have said they are ready to pounce if they see signs that Trump's EPA, headed by fossil fuels industry ally Scott Pruitt, is ignoring science in making climate-related regulatory changes.\n\n\"I think the bottom line is that we hope any anti-regulatory rule-making should be so unscientific ... almost any federal judge should see through the Trump administration maneuvering,\" said Pat Gallagher, a Sierra Club lawyer.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-climate-idUSKBN1712X6"}, {"title": "Senate banking chair wants financial rules reform by early 2018", "text": "File photo: Chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Mike Crapo (R-ID) hearing listens to testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen on the \u201cSemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\u201d on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February...

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nNEWARK, N.J. Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were sentenced to federal prison on Wednesday for their part in the \"Bridgegate\" lane closure scandal that helped scuttle the Republican's presidential bid.\n\nBill Baroni, 45, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will serve two years, while Bridget Kelly, 44, a former deputy chief of staff for Christie, received a sentence of 1-1/2 years.\n\nThe defendants were found guilty in November of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge linking New York City and northern New Jersey, the world's busiest span, for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution.\n\nProsecutors said the resulting traffic jams in the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey, were intended to punish its Democratic mayor for refusing to back Christie's re-election bid, as the governor's aides tried to burnish his bipartisan credentials before his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nChristie has denied any involvement and was not charged. But the scandal tarnished his national profile and contributed to record-low approval ratings in his home state.\n\nIn an NBC interview before the hearing, Christie deflected questions about the appropriate penalty. A spokesman for the governor, Brian Murray, said Christie would have no comment on the sentences.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark rejected defense pleas that she sentence Baroni and Kelly to probation rather than prison, citing \"an outrageous display of abuse of power.\"\n\nBut she agreed with prosecutors that Kelly bore slightly less responsibility than Baroni, New Jersey's highest-ranking Port Authority official. The agency oversees operations for major bridges, ports and airports in the New York City area and is run by officials appointed by New Jersey and New York state's governors.\n\nBoth defendants told Wigenton they felt remorse.\n\n\"I respectfully ask that you allow me the opportunity to reconnect with my children and rebuild our lives,\" said a tearful Kelly, a single mother of four.\n\nBaroni and Kelly will be allowed to remain free on bail while they appeal their convictions.\n\nFollowing the sentencings, Kelly struck a defiant note outside the courthouse.\n\n\"This fight is far from over,\" she said. \"I will not allow myself to be the scapegoat in this case.\"\n\n'BANANA REPUBLIC'\n\nThe plot to use the bridge to inflict political payback was \"out of the playbook of some dictator of a banana republic,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes said in court.\n\nDuring the trial, Kelly and Baroni testified that another Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, convinced them the lane realignment was part of a legitimate traffic study.\n\nBut Wildstein, who pleaded guilty and was the government's star witness, told jurors the defendants were fully aware the study was a cover story.\n\nIt was Kelly's infamous email to Wildstein saying, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" that set the plan in motion, prosecutors said. The three officials selected the first day of school to maximize gridlock and ignored increasingly desperate pleas for help from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich.\n\nNo other officials have been charged over Bridgegate, though evidence at trial suggested Christie and numerous members of his inner circle knew about the closures earlier than they had publicly acknowledged.\n\n\"While a number of people outside of this courtroom were involved in what happened in Fort Lee that day, some charged, some not, that does not change the fact that I failed,\" Baroni said in court.\n\nAfter his White House bid fizzled early in 2016, Christie became one of the staunchest supporters of his former rival, Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidency.\n\nChristie headed Trump's transition team and was considered a candidate for a Cabinet post. But he was replaced as transition team chief soon after the election Nov. 8 and passed over for an administration job.\n\nState law bars the governor from running for a third term this year.\n\nThe Bridgegate case indirectly led to one other conviction, after authorities investigating the plot uncovered an unrelated bribery scheme orchestrated by a Christie confidante, former Port Authority Chairman David Samson.\n\nSamson pleaded guilty to pressuring United Airlines into operating an unprofitable flight so he could visit a vacation home more easily.\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-jersey-bridgegate-idUSKBN170139"}, {"title": "U.S. to review energy royalty rates on federal land", "text": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke testifies before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on ''Identifying Indian Affairs priorities for the Trump Administration'' at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 8, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON Leaders of the largest police union in the United States have warned President Donald Trump that he could endanger public safety if he follows through with cuts in federal grants to immigrant \"sanctuary cities,\" the union's director told Reuters after a White House meeting.\n\nIn a move that concerned the Fraternal Order of Police, one of Trump's biggest supporters in the 2016 election campaign, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday that the Justice Department would restrict grants to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nSanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and New York, refuse to cooperate sometimes by not notifying Department of Homeland Security agents when illegal immigrants are being released from incarceration.\n\nDozens of local governments and cities have joined a \"sanctuary\" movement aimed at protecting immigrants. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and in general, these cities offer safe harbor and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nTrump met on Tuesday with police union leaders. Sessions was at the meeting, too, along with Vice President Mike Pence, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the union.\n\nThe Justice Department plans to restrict sanctuary cities from using grants from the department's Office of Justice Programs and Community Oriented Policing Services, both of which send grant money to local and state police departments.\n\nPasco said the union does not support the policies of sanctuary cities, but its executives are concerned that cuts in funding could hurt police departments in those areas.\n\nTrump told the group that the policy on sanctuary cities was a work in progress and that he would work with the union to make sure public safety would not be affected, Pasco said.\n\nTrump's reassurances clashed with Sessions' announcement, when he said, \"The Department of Justice will require jurisdictions seeking or applying for department grants to certify compliance\" with federal immigration law \"as a condition for receiving these awards.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 seeking to crackdown on sanctuary cities. The order excluded restrictions on funding \"deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment when asked about the discrepancy between the executive order and Sessions' announcement. The spokesman also declined to comment on Pasco's account of the meeting.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPasco said he met with Sessions last month and told him the union would oppose any move to restrict federal funding for police.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-sanctuary-police-idUSKBN16Z34D"}, {"title": "Congress sends White House repeal of broadband privacy rules", "text": "WASHINGTON The U.S. House voted on Tuesday 215-205 to repeal regulations requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers' privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc's Google or Facebook Inc.\n\nThe White House said earlier Tuesday that President Donald Trump strongly supports the repeal of the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama.\n\nUnder the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children's information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing.\n\nLast week, the Senate voted 50-48 to reverse the rules in a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThe White House in its statement said internet providers would need to obtain affirmative \"opt-in\" consent from consumers to use and share certain information, but noted that websites are not required to get the same consent. \"This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor,\" the White House said.\n\nWebsites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nFCC chairman Ajit Pai in a statement praised the decision of Congress to overturn \"privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies.\" Last week, Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama internet provider rules, but critics say they will weaker.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the measure, said companies \"should not be able to use and sell the sensitive data they collect from you without your permission.\"\n\nAn Internet & Television Association statement called the repeal \"an important step toward restoring consumer privacy protections that apply consistently.\"\n\nOne critic of the repeal, Craig Aaron, president of Free Press advocacy group, said major Silicon Valley companies shied away from the fight over the rules because they profit from consumer data.\n\n\"There are a lot of companies that are very concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being regulated on privacy issues, and are sitting this out in a way that they haven\u2019t sat out previous privacy issues,\" Aaron said.\n\nRepresentative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Tuesday that Comcast could know his personal information because he looked up his mother's medical condition and his purchase history. \"Just last week I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take? Or the color?\" Capuano asked. \"They are going to sell it to the underwear companies.\"\n\nComcast declined to comment.\n\nRepresentative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, said the rules \"unfairly skews the market in favor\" of websites that are free to collect data without consent.\n\nRepublican commissioners, including Pai, said in October that the rules would unfairly give websites like Facebook, Twitter Inc or Google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus further dominate digital advertising.

The decision has not been previously reported.\n\nThe move comes as Democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of Republican President Donald Trump's policies. State AGs in Washington and Hawaii successfully sued to block Trump's executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and California's attorney general has pledged to defend the state's environmental standards.\n\nRepublican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that AGs should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents, two sources familiar with the closed door process said. Additionally, a desire by some to roll back same-sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations.\n\nThe so-called 'incumbency rule' observed by the state attorneys' party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of U.S. politics, aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest, such as consumer protection.\n\nAttorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state, charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own. AGs took tobacco companies to court in the 1990s, and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In larger states, an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources.\n\nTwelve Republican state AGs on Monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting Trump's revised travel restrictions.\n\nScott Will, executive director of the Republican Attorneys General Association, confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule, but declined to discuss specifics of the vote.\n\n\"The stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table,\" Will said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe vote was taken over the phone with a tally of 15-8, the two sources said. Not every Republican AG participated.\n\nSome of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents, so AGs shouldn't be any different, the sources said.\n\nThose opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship, and noted that Republican AGs had grown their ranks under the current system, showing there was no need to change the rules now, the sources said.\n\nIn 2000, Republicans held 12 of the 51 state AG positions, including the District of Columbia, but that number is about to hit 29, if a nomination made by New Hampshire's Republican governor this month is confirmed.\n\nOne of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in Virginia, where Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, is seeking reelection this November. In all, 31 AG elections are scheduled for 2018. Republicans currently hold 18 of those seats, compared to 13 for Democrats, but some of the incumbents may not run for re-election.\n\nKarl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia and current co-chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, said the Republican group's decision likely means Democrats will follow suit.\n\n\"What's good for the goose is good for the gander,\" Racine said in an interview.\n\nColorado attorney general Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, is up for election next year in a state that has been trending Democrat. A well-funded push to unseat her, something the Democratic AG group wouldn't have participated in under the incumbency agreement, could spell trouble.\n\nCoffman opposed the incumbency rule change, the sources said. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCORPORATE PLEDGE\n\nIn laying out the reasons for the rule change, Will pointed to the key role Republican AGs played in opposing some of President Barack Obama's policies.\n\nRolling back same-sex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations, said the two people familiar with the discussion. More Republican state AGs could help further that effort, though the current composition of the U.S. Supreme Court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating Democratic AGs, the two sources said.\n\nParticipants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage 5-Hour Energy, the sources said. The money depended on the Republican group changing its rules to target incumbent Democrats.\n\nThe company that manufactures 5-Hour Energy, Innovation Ventures, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican AG group declined to answer questions about the debate, including the role of 5-Hour's pledge.\n\nInnovation Ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink, with varied outcomes.\n\nLast month a Washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly $4.3 million in one such case, brought by Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block Trump's first travel restrictions. The company has said it would appeal the ruling. In at least two other cases, in Oregon and Indiana, Innovation Ventures prevailed. Oregon has appealed.\n\nThe precise dollar amount of the company's pledge to Republican AGs could not be determined, nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target Democrats.\n\nAlready, the Republican Attorneys General Association has built a fundraising advantage. In 2016, it raised about $14.5 million, including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the Judicial Crisis Network and Koch Industries, according to tax filings.\n\nSean Rankin, executive director of the Democratic AG group, said it raised about $5.2 million in 2016.

But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms.\n\nBut Trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and Trump promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt U.S. business.\n\nSince being elected, Trump has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it.\n\nChristiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change who helped broker the Paris accord, lamented Trump's order.\n\n\"Trying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector, with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate, is going against the flow of economics,\" she said.\n\nThe order directs the EPA to start a formal process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican-controlled states.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nSome 85 percent of U.S. states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented, according to Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a group of state and local air pollution control agencies.\n\nTrump\u2019s order also lifts the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by Obama in 2016 as part of a review to study the program's impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers.\n\nIt also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting, and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities.\n\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner; writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Cynthia Osterman)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN16Z1L6"}, {"title": "U.S. Senate backs Montenegro's membership in NATO", "text": "WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed the expansion of NATO to allow Montenegro to join the alliance, hoping to send a message that the United States will push back against Russian efforts to increase its influence in Europe.\n\nThe long-delayed vote was 97-2 in favor of Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

REUTERS/Kristina Barker\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has billed his move to re-open federal lands to new coal leases as a win for miners seeking to expand production. But a review of company filings shows that coal miners with the most to gain already have enough leases in hand to last well over a decade.\n\nTrump will sign a decree on Tuesday to reverse former President Barack Obama's 2016 ban on new federal coal leases, part of a wide-ranging executive order to sweep away green regulations his administration says have hobbled the drilling and mining industries.\n\n\"When we evaluate energy, let's look at the social cost of not having a job,\" Trump\u2019s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Twitter post on Tuesday ahead of the executive order.\n\nBut companies focused on coal deposits below federal lands, such as Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak, have enough coal in the ground on existing leases to last an average of more than 17 years at 2015 sales levels, earnings reports show.\n\nThat suggests miners could already ramp up production levels immediately if the market demanded more coal. Energy experts say that is unlikely on a large scale due to stiff competition from cheap and abundant natural gas.\n\n\"These initiatives prevent things from getting worse for coal, but they won't help much,\" said Charles Dayton, vice president of market analytics at Doyle Trading Consultants in Colorado, which has been tracking reserve levels on public lands.\n\nShares in Cloud Peak were up about 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday, ahead of the executive order, with Peabody up 1.5 percent and Arch down 0.3 percent.\n\nThe current level of reserves appeared to be within historical norms. A decade ago, under Republican President George W. Bush when there were no bans on federal coal leasing, the industry had about 18 years worth of leases on federal lands, according to a Reuters examination of securities filings.\n\nArch Coal and Peabody confirmed they have substantial reserves on their federal leases already, but nonetheless welcomed Trump\u2019s move.\n\n\"Peabody has a comfortable amount of reserves in the Powder River Basin, although we recognize the poor public policy represented by the leasing moratorium put into place by the prior administration,\" Peabody spokesman Vic Svec told Reuters in an email.\n\nArch Coal has \"sufficient permitted reserves to sustain our operations on federal lands for a number of years to come,\" spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi said. \"But as with all producers we will need to add reserves over time, and the ability to obtain those reserves when needed is important.\"\n\nOfficials at Peak and Contura did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump's executive order will also seek to undo Obama-era rules limiting carbon emissions. One example is the Clean Power Plan, a regulation that would have increased pressure on states to replace coal-fired power stations with ones using cleaner fuels like natural gas, wind and solar.\n\n\"SIGNAL TO MARKETS\"\n\nObama's administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in January 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review to ensure royalties from lease deals provide fair returns to taxpayers.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the royalty review would continue even with the ban on leases lifted. Some analysts said this scenario could trigger a near-term land rush by companies fearing higher royalty rates in the future.\n\nCoal accounts for about a third of U.S. electricity production, down from about half a decade ago. About 40 percent of all U.S. coal comes from federal lands, mainly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.\n\nLuke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association industry group, said he expected Trump\u2019s executive order to have symbolic impact, at least.\n\n\"Lifting the moratorium would strengthen the signal to markets that the federal government is not any longer standing in the way of fossil energy,\" he said.\n\nHe added that re-opening federal lands to new leases could also play into a production upswing if demand ultimately increases. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast a 9 percent increase in western coal production to 443.4 million short tons by 2018, driven mainly by higher natural gas prices.\n\nOthers were less optimistic about the U.S. coal industry's outlook, saying the best Trump could do is slow the sector\u2019s decline. Since 2012, coal production has plunged more than 25 percent to the lowest levels since 1978 due to falling prices. The industry has been hit with massive layoffs and bankruptcies.\n\n(Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by David Gregorio)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-coal-analysis-idUSKBN16Z2AT"}, {"title": "U.S. charges Turkish banker in Iran sanctions probe", "text": "Mehmet Hakan Atilla (R), a deputy general manager of Halkbank, is shown in this court room sketch with his attorney Gerald J.

Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign on Feb. 13 after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.\n\nU.S. officials said that after meeting with Russian Kislyak at Trump Tower last December, a meeting also attended by Flynn, Kushner met later in December with Sergei Gorkov, chairman of Vnesheconombank.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed the meetings, saying nothing of consequence was discussed.\n\nGorkov was appointed head of VEB in early 2016 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He graduated from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Russia\u2019s internal security agency. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Merit for Services to the Fatherland, according to the bank's website.\n\nAccording to two congressional staffers, some Senate investigators want to question Kushner and Flynn about whether they discussed with Gorkov or other Russian officials or financial executives the possibility of investing in 666 Fifth Avenue in New York or other Kushner Co or Trump properties if the new administration lifted the sanctions.\n\nVEB, aside from being under sanctions, has been grappling with bad debt after financing politically expedient projects such as construction for the Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nIt received 150 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) in support from the Russian budget in 2016, when its senior management was sacked and replaced by a team of executives from Russia's biggest lender Sberbank.\n\nIn an article posted on Dec. 18, Forbes estimated that Jared Kushner, his brother Josh and his parents, Charles and Seryl, have a fortune of at least $1.8 billion, more than half of which Forbes estimates is held in real estate.\n\nForbes did not provide a specific estimate for Jared Kushner\u2019s net worth on his own.\n\nFOREIGN CONTACTS\n\nOn Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Kushner is willing to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by U.S. Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican.\n\n\u201cThroughout the campaign and the transition, Jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials ... and so, given this role, he volunteered to speak with Chairman Burr's committee,\" Spicer told reporters at his daily briefing.\n\nThe Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate panel also said Kushner had agreed to be interviewed but no date had yet been scheduled.\n\nSimply meeting with representatives of a U.S.-sanctioned entity is not a violation of sanctions or against the law.\n\nEvgeny Buryakov, 41, a Russian citizen who worked at Vnesheconombank and whom U.S. authorities accused of posing as a banker while participating in a New York spy ring, pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge in March 2016.

And they have refused to lock up individuals longer than otherwise warranted at the request of federal agents seeking to deport them.\n\nTrump administration officials says the deportation crackdown is focused on illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes. They insist public safety is jeopardized when police refuse to notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of plans to release such a person from local custody.\n\n\"Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators,\" Sessions said at a White House news briefing.\n\nHis threat to withhold grants as punishment drew swift condemnation from California and New York officials.\n\nCalifornia Senate leader Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat, called Sessions\u2019 threat \"nothing short of blackmail,\u201d accusing of \u201crace-based scapegoating\u201d in its crackdown on immigrants.\n\nCritics also argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities' trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. And they question whether the administration is really targeting dangerous criminals.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who made tougher immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his campaign, directed the government to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions in a Jan. 25 executive order. That order has yet to be put into effect, but Sessions' announcement seemed to be the first step in doing so.\n\nThe Justice Department grants typically are used to help police improve crime-fighting techniques, buy new equipment and assist victims of crime.\n\nSessions may find his ability to sway local decision-making through the Justice Department's purse is limited, because only a fraction of its grant dollars flow directly to city and county governments.\n\nFederal records show the Justice Department doled out $1 billion to state governments and $430 million to nonprofits, but only $136 million directly to cities and counties last year.\n\nNew York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office would continue helping local governments \"have the tools they need to protect their immigrant communities.\"\n\nLOCAL DEFIANCE\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, whose city is home to one of the largest U.S. immigrant communities, also denounced Sessions' threat to use funding as a form of coercion.\n\n\u201cL.A.\u2019s values are not for sale,\" Garcetti said. \"Slashing funds for first responders, for our port and airport, for counterterrorism, crime-fighting and community-building serves no one.\"\n\nSo far no state has adopted policies barring cooperation with immigration authorities, though Maryland's Democratic-controlled House of Delegates approved such legislation last week. The state's Republican governor, Larry Hogan, has said he would veto the bill.\n\nCalifornia's De Leon is backing a bill that would essentially make all of the most populous U.S. state a sanctuary, but he does not currently have the votes to pass it.\n\nSessions sought to frame the debate as a public-safety issue, citing the case of a woman shot to death in San Francisco two years ago by illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.\n\nSan Francisco may not be affected by the new restrictions, as the city and county received no funding from the department in the most recent fiscal year.\n\nHowever, Sessions' order could impact other jurisdictions. New Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago and New York City - all singled out as possibly noncompliant by an inspector general's report last year - collectively received $15 million in Justice Department grants.\n\nAccording to Trump\u2019s executive order, Sessions would have to wait until the Homeland Security Department determines what constitutes a \"sanctuary city\" before funding is restricted.

There were better investment prospects for renewable energies such as solar power than coal, she added.\n\nThe fear has long been that a pullout of the world's top economy would drain other nations' willingness to cut greenhouse gas emissions under an agreement ratified by nations as diverse as China, Saudi Arabia and African countries.\n\nBut there is an emerging rival view that Paris might be better off.\n\nACHILLES HEEL\n\n\"The Achilles heel of the Paris Agreement is that it's built on consensus,\" said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Center at Stockholm University.\n\n\"It's very difficult to have a negative giant in the room\" able to obstruct all decisions, he said, adding that he had swung in recent weeks to reckon that a U.S. pullout would be better overall from an earlier view that it would be a \"big failure\".\n\nThe Paris Agreement has few binding obligations. It lets all nations set their own goals for fighting climate change and has no penalties for non-compliance.\n\nGovernments have set a 2018 deadline to work out a rule book for the Paris Agreement, filling in details, for instance, of how nations will report and monitor their curbs on emissions.\n\nInfographic ID: '2f3oKDV'\n\nMaldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim - chair of the Alliance of Small Island States whose members fear they are at risk from rising sea levels - urged continued U.S. participation in Paris.\n\n\"The closer you look at it, the clearer it becomes that it (the Paris Agreement) also promotes important strategic, economic, and security benefits as well,\" he said.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg also said it would be better for the United States to stay. \"But I don't think that it's the end of the Paris Agreement if the United States decides to leave,\" she said.\n\nOliver Geden, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, disagreed. A U.S. withdrawal would badly undermine the Paris Agreement and any decisions would be largely irrelevant without the world's biggest economy, he said. \"The momentum could fade away pretty soon,\" he predicted.\n\nStill, almost 200 nations agreed after Trump's election in November that the world had an \"urgent duty\" to combat an \"alarming and unprecedented\" rate of global warming.\n\n\"The pace and scale of change already underway in the global economy is remarkable and irreversible,\" said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a forum with 18 trillion euros ($20 trillion) in assets under management.\n\n\"Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created very rapidly in clean energy,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. target under Paris, set by Obama, is to cut emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of global efforts to avert more downpours, droughts, heatwaves and floods.\n\nTrump's pro-coal policies are likely to make U.S. emissions cuts less ambitious.\n\nBy staying in the Paris Agreement, Trump would also undermine a demand in its Article 4 that successive national climate plans have to be ever deeper cuts. A U.S. pullout would make it easier for backers to argue that the principle has not been violated.\n\nThe Paris Agreement sets an over-riding goal of limiting global warming to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

A key test will be how well it will be able to translate its mobilization into votes in the 2018 midterm congressional elections.\n\n\"It's one of the dirty little secrets of American politics that there has been a religious left all along and it just hasn't done a good job of organizing,\" said J. Patrick Hornbeck II, chairman of the theology department at Fordham University, a Jesuit school in New York.\n\n\"It has taken a crisis, or perceived crisis, like Trump's election to cause folks on the religious left to really own their religion in the public square,\" Hornbeck said.\n\nReligious progressive activism has been part of American history. Religious leaders and their followers played key roles in campaigns to abolish slavery, promote civil rights and end the Vietnam War, among others. The latest upwelling of left-leaning religious activism has accompanied the dawn of the Trump presidency.\n\nSome in the religious left are inspired by Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic leader who has been an outspoken critic of anti-immigrant policies and a champion of helping the needy.\n\nAlthough support for the religious left is difficult to measure, leaders point to several examples, such as a surge of congregations offering to provide sanctuary to immigrants seeking asylum, churches urging Republicans to reconsider repealing the Obamacare health law and calls to preserve federal spending on foreign aid.\n\nThe number of churches volunteering to offer sanctuary to asylum seekers doubled to 800 in 45 of the 50 U.S. states after the election, said the Elkhart, Indiana-based Church World Service, a coalition of Christian denominations which helps refugees settle in the United States - and the number of new churches offering help has grown so quickly that the group has lost count.\n\n\"The religious community, the religious left is getting out, hitting the streets, taking action, raising their voices,\" said Reverend Noel Anderson, its national grassroots coordinator.\n\nIn one well-publicized case, a Quaker church in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on March 14 took in a Honduran woman who has been living illegally in the United States for 25 years and feared she would be targeted for deportation.\n\n'NEVER SEEN' THIS\n\nLeaders of Faith in Public Life, a progressive policy group, were astounded when 300 clergy members turned out at a January rally at the U.S. Senate attempting to block confirmation of Trump's attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, because of his history of controversial statements on race.\n\n\"I've never seen hundreds of clergy turning up like that to oppose a Cabinet nominee,\" said Reverend Jennifer Butler, the group's chief executive.\n\nThe group on Wednesday convened a Capitol Hill rally of hundreds of pastors from as far away as Ohio, North Carolina and Texas to urge Congress to ensure that no people lose their health insurance as a result of a vote to repeal Obamacare.\n\nFinancial support is also picking up. Donations to the Christian activist group Sojourners have picked up by 30 percent since Trump's election, the group said.\n\nBut some observers were skeptical that the religious left could equal the religious right politically any time soon.\n\n\"It really took decades of activism for the religious right to become the force that it is today,\" said Peter Ubertaccio, chairman of the political science department at Stonehill College, a Catholic school outside Boston.\n\nBut the power potential of the \"religious left\" is not negligible. The \"Moral Mondays\" movement, launched in 2013 by the North Carolina NAACP's Reverend William Barber, is credited with contributing to last year's election defeat of Republican Governor Pat McCrory by Democrat Roy Cooper.\n\nThe new political climate is also spurring new alliances, with churches, synagogues and mosques speaking out against the recent spike in bias incidents, including threats against mosques and Jewish community centers.\n\nThe Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, which encourages alliances between Jewish and Muslim women, has tripled its number of U.S. chapters to nearly 170 since November, said founder Sheryl Olitzky.\n\n\"This is not about partisanship, but about vulnerable populations who need protection, whether it's the LGBT community, the refugee community, the undocumented community,\" said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have already signed up for the center's annual Washington meeting on political activism, about three times as many as normal, Pesner said.\n\nLeaders of the religious right who supported Trump say they see him delivering on his promises and welcomed plans to defund Planned Parenthood, whose healthcare services for women include abortion, through the proposed repeal of Obamacare.\n\n\"We have not seen any policy proposals that run counter to our faith,\" said Lance Lemmonds, a spokesman for the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Duluth, Georgia.\n\n(Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Additional reporting by Laila Kearney in New York; Editing by Dina Kyriakidou Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-religion-idUSKBN16Y114"}, {"title": "Italian prime minister to meet Trump in U.S. on April 20: diplomatic sources", "text": "Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni signs a document during the EU leaders meeting on the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, in Rome, Italy March 25, 2017.

Price's power resides in how to interpret that law, and which programs to emphasize and fund.\n\nHospitals and physician groups have been counting on support from Medicare - the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled - to continue driving payment reform policies built into Obamacare that reward doctors and hospitals for providing high quality care at a lower cost.\n\nThe Obama Administration had committed to shifting half of all Medicare payments to these alternative payment models by 2018. Although he has voiced general support for innovative payment programs, Price has been a loud critic of mandatory federal programs that dictate how doctors should deliver healthcare.\n\nProviders such as Dr. Richard Gilfillan, chief executive of Trinity Healthcare, a $15.9 billion Catholic health system, say they will press on with these alternative payment plans with or without the government's blessing. But they have been actively lobbying Trump officials for support, according to interviews with more than a dozen hospital executives, physicians and policy experts.\n\nWithout the backing of Medicare, the biggest payer in the U.S. healthcare system which Price now oversees, the nascent payment reform movement could lose momentum, sidelining a transformation many experts believe is vital to reining in runaway U.S. healthcare spending.\n\nPrice \"can't change the legislation, but of course he's supposed to implement it. He could impact it,\" said John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a broad alliance of healthcare stakeholders that has been lobbying the new administration for support of value-based care.\n\nThe move Friday to pull the Republican bill only reinforces the risk to the existing law, which Trump said on Friday \"will soon explode.\"\n\n\"It seems that the Trump Administration now faces a choice whether to actively undermine the ACA or reshape it administratively,\" Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The ACA marketplaces weren't collapsing, but they could be made to collapse through administrative actions,\" he added.\n\nNEW PAYMENT PLANS AT RISK\n\nThe United States spends $3 trillion a year on healthcare - more by far than 10 other wealthy countries - yet has the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rate, according to a 2013 Commonwealth Fund report. Link to Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2nkTWoC\n\nHealth costs have soared thanks in part to the traditional way doctors and hospitals get paid, namely by receiving a fee for each service they provide. So the more advanced imaging tests a doctor orders or pricey procedures they perform, the more money he or she makes, regardless of whether the patient's health improves.\n\n\"We have a completely broken economy in healthcare,\" said Blair Childs, senior vice president at hospital purchasing group Premier Inc. \"Literally, all of the incentives in fee-for-service are for higher cost.\"\n\nAlternative payment models are designed to remove incentives that reward overtreatment of patients. Private insurers are on board, with Aetna Inc, Anthem Inc, UnitedHealth Group and most Blue Cross insurers announcing plans to shift half of their reimbursement to alternative payment models to control costs.\n\nTo promote the shift to alternative payments, the ACA created an incubator program at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The CMS innovation center is funded by $10 billion over 10 years to test payment schemes aimed at improving quality and cutting the cost of care.\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to make some of these payment programs mandatory has drawn the ire of Price, a former U.S. senator and orthopedic surgeon. In response to a mandatory payment program for joint replacements last September, for example, Price charged that the CMS innovation center was \"experimenting with Americans\u2019 health.\"\n\nIn his January 17 confirmation, Price said he was a \"strong supporter of innovation,\" but said he believed the CMS innovation center \"has gotten a bit off track.\"\n\nTRUMP SETS WHEELS IN MOTION ON DAY 1\n\nPresident Trump has already signed an executive order directing the HHS to begin unraveling Obamacare. In the early hours of his presidency, Trump directed government agencies to freeze regulations and take steps to weaken the healthcare law.\n\nThe order directed departments to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation\" of provisions that imposed fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. These moves were meant to minimize the costs and regulatory burdens imposed on states, private entities and individuals.\n\nDavid Cutler, the Harvard health economist who helped the Obama Administration shape the ACA, said Price could do all sorts of things to undermine the law.\n\n\"If he wants to blow it up, he can,\" Cutler said in an email. But if they do, he added, \"they alone will own the failure.\"\n\n(Editing by Edward Tobin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-outlook-analysis-idUSKBN16X0IV"}, {"title": "Trump ally Stone offers to testify in Russian meddling probe", "text": "WASHINGTON Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, said on Sunday he has offered to testify before a congressional committee investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and ties to the Trump campaign.\n\nStone, an informal adviser to Trump, told ABC's \"This Week\" he had not received a reply from the House of Representatives intelligence committee on his offer of public testimony.\n\nAlong with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has also offered to appear before the panel, Stone was among the Trump associates whose communications and financial transactions were being examined by the FBI and others as part of a larger investigation into possible links with Russian officials, according to a Jan. 20 report in the New York Times.\n\nWithout citing any names, FBI Director James Comey confirmed at the committee's public hearing last week that the FBI was investigating possible Russian ties to Trump's campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election.\n\nStone said he was anxious to testify in public.\n\n\"I reiterate again, I have had no contacts or collusions with the Russians,\" he told ABC, adding later, \"There is no collusion, none, at least none that I know about, in Donald Trump's campaign for president.\"\n\nAt Monday's intelligence committee hearing, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, cited concern over Stone's communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Guccifer 2, who claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic groups.\n\nStone said he had spoken to Assange through an intermediary and to Guccifer on Twitter in an exchange he made public. Stone also cast doubt on whether Guccifer was a Russian agent.\n\n\"Just because the intelligence services say something, as we know from history, does not make it true,\" he said, reflecting the doubts that Trump himself has sown about U.S. spy agencies.\n\nCarter Page, another Trump campaign adviser whose contacts with Russians were mentioned by Schiff at Monday's hearing, also has offered to appear before the committee, according to multiple media reports.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia sponsored the hacking of Democratic Party groups during the 2016 campaign to benefit Republican Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied the allegations of meddling.\n\nTrump has dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and Russia and has accused Democrats and the media of using the issue to attack him.\n\nThe House committee investigation was marred on Wednesday after its Republican chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, announced to the public and briefed Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee.\n\nNunes apologized to the intelligence panel the next day.\n\nHowever, he further alienated Democrats on the committee on Friday when he canceled a hearing with intelligence officials from former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, suggested the cancellation came after pressure from the White House.\n\nSchiff and other Democrats said last week's actions raised more doubts about whether Nunes, a Trump ally who served on the president's transition team, can conduct a credible investigation.\n\n\"I think the chairman has to make a decision whether to act as a surrogate of the White House as he did during the campaign and the transition or to lead an independent and credible, investigation,\u201d Schiff told CBS' \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN16X0RK"}, {"title": "Republican lawmaker quits conservative House group over healthcare conflict", "text": "WASHINGTON Republican U.S. Representative Ted Poe resigned from the House Freedom Caucus on Sunday over the conservative legislative group's role in sinking a healthcare overhaul championed by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,\" the Texas lawmaker said in a statement. \"Leaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress.\"\n\nPoe was in favor of the Republican legislation, but the Freedom Caucus argued the proposal did not go far enough in repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, consisting of the House of Representatives' most conservative members, was instrumental in dealing Trump a stunning political setback on Friday when Republican House leaders pulled the healthcare legislation, derailing a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.\n\nTrump's fellow Republicans control both houses of Congress.\n\nTrump had courted Freedom Caucus lawmakers intensively.

Supporters of President Donald Trump holding a rally on a popular southern California beach clashed with counter-protesters on Saturday and four people were arrested, law enforcement said.\n\nMultiple fights broke out and at least one Trump supporter was doused with pepper spray when pro-Trump demonstrators marching along Bolsa Chica State Beach encountered a small group opposed to the Republican president who had gathered to denounce the rally.\n\nFour counter-protesters were arrested, three for illegal use of pepper spray and one for assault and battery, Kevin Pearsall, a spokesman for the California State Parks Police said on Saturday evening.\n\nThe fights appeared to start in the early afternoon when around a dozen anti-Trump protesters dressed in all black refused to move from a bike path to allow a larger group of pro-Trump supporters taking part in the Make America Great Again rally to pass. The confrontation escalated into a fight with more skirmishes quickly breaking out.\n\nAt least one person was pepper-sprayed by an anti-Trump protester, Pearsall said. Park police estimated that 2,000 Trump supporters flocked to the stretch of coastline located south of the ocean-side community of Huntington Beach. Around 20 counter-protesters attended, Pearsall said.\n\nKnown as Surf City, U.S.A., Huntington Beach is located some 40 miles (64 km) south of Los Angeles.\n\nVideo footage from social media uploaded to the Los Angeles Times' website showed a chaotic scene with men fighting in the sand and a group of around 20 Trump supporters, some carrying Trump flags, chasing a man in a black mask away from the beach and on to a freeway.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.\n\nHouse of Representatives leaders yanked the bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the party's most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes, ensuring that Trump's first major legislative initiative since taking office on Jan. 20 ended in failure. Democrats were unified against it.\n\nHouse Republicans had planned a vote on the measure after Trump late on Thursday cut off negotiations with Republicans who had balked at the plan and issued an ultimatum to vote on Friday, win or lose. But desperate lobbying by the White House and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was unable to round up the 216 votes needed for passage.\n\n\"We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate.\n\nWith Friday's legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it.\n\nThe healthcare failure called into question not only Trump's ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Party's capacity to govern effectively.\n\nNeither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting \"big tax cuts\" through Congress, another tricky proposition.\n\nRepublican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the government's \"nanny state\" role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago.\n\nBut the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trump's vaunted image as a deal maker.\n\nAmid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed.\n\n\"We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short,\" Trump said. \"With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed \"because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises.\"\n\nDemocrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray.\n\nAnd some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt.\n\n\"There were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like,\" Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryan's leadership.\n\n\"Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,\" said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that \"Obamacare is imploding\" and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill.\n\nFriday's events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard,\" Ryan said at a news conference, adding that his fellow Republicans are experiencing what he called \"growing pains\" transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party.\n\n\"Obamacare's the law of the land,\" Ryan added. \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n\"A LITTLE SURPRISED\"\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus, the House's most conservative members, were instrumental in the bill's failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare.\n\nTrump said he was disappointed and \"a little surprised\" with the Freedom Caucus opposition.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026.\n\nNews that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trump's other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\n\nBenchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.\n\nShares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent.

If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether it's the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants.\"\n\nRepresentative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, \"Sometimes you're playing fantasy football and sometimes you\u2019re in the real game.\"\n\nObamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.\n\nThe House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacare's income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits\n\nIt also would have ended Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.\n\nHouse leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain \"essential benefits\" such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage.\n\nClick on the links below for related graphics:\n\nGraphic on Obamacare and Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)\n\nGraphic on poll on Americans' views of the Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs/2n7f3e4)\n\n(Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, David Morgan, David Lawder, Susan Cornwell, Susan Heavey, Richard Cowan, Steve Holland, Roberta Rampton, Patricia Zengerle and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Will Dunham; Editing by Bill Rigby and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16V149"}, {"title": "Trump greenlights Keystone XL pipeline, but obstacles loom", "text": "TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russell Girling speaks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a permit for TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL oil pipeline in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., March 24, 2017.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON/CALGARY, Alberta U.S. President Donald Trump's administration approved TransCanada Corp's (TRP.TO) Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom.\n\nThe approval reverses a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project, but the company still needs to win financing, acquire local permits, and fend off likely legal challenges for the pipeline to be built.\n\n\"TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed,\" Trump said in the Oval Office before turning to ask TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russell Girling when construction would start.\n\n\"We've got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there,\" Girling replied.\n\n\"Nebraska?\" Trump said. \"I'll call Nebraska.\"\n\nTrump announced the presidential permit for Keystone XL at the White House with Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, standing nearby. He said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n\nThe pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by Obama, who said it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute to emissions linked to global warming.\n\nTrump, however, campaigned on a promise to approve it, and he signed an executive order soon after taking office in January to advance the project.\n\nTransCanada's U.S.-listed shares (TRP.N) dipped 5 cents to close at $46.21 on Friday.\n\nJOBS\n\nTrump has claimed the project would create 28,000 jobs in the United States. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs.\n\nThe president said he would get in touch with Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts later in the day.\n\nTransCanada applied to the Nebraska Public Service Commission in February for approval of the pipeline's route through the state. The company said it expects that process to conclude this year.\n\nRicketts said in a statement posted on Twitter that the project would help his state.\n\n\"I have full confidence that the Public Service Commission will conduct a thorough and fair review of the application,\" he said.\n\nThe White House has said the pipeline is exempt from a Trump executive order requiring new pipelines to be made from U.S. steel, because much of the pipe for the project has already been built and stockpiled.\n\n\"As we move forward, we'll continue to look to buy the rest of the materials we need from ... American manufacturers. We'll put American workers to work,\" Girling told reporters.\n\nEnvironmental groups vowed to fight it.\n\nGreenpeace said it would pressure banks to withhold financing for the multibillion-dollar project, and others said they would fight the pipeline in court.\n\n\"We'll use every tool in the kit,\" said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nSince Obama had nixed the pipeline based on an environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department in early 2014, opponents will likely argue in court that Trump cannot reverse the decision without conducting a new assessment.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nFred Jauss, partner at the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former attorney with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said local permitting would also be a challenge.\n\n\"The Presidential Permit is only one part of a web of federal, state, and local permits that must be obtained prior to starting construction,\" he said. \"Other federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, state regulatory commissions, and even local planning boards may have requirements that need to be fulfilled by Keystone prior to construction.\"\n\n\"In addition, TransCanada may still need to reach deals with hundreds of potentially affected landowners on the pipeline\u2019s route. There is a lot of work ahead for TransCanada.\u201d\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada's oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe project could be a boon for Canada, which has struggled to bring its vast oil reserves to market.\n\n\"Our government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision,\" said a spokesman for Canada's minister of natural resources. \"The importance of a common, continental energy market cannot be overstated.\"\n\nThe president of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack Gerard, said the approval was \"welcome news\" and would bolster U.S. energy security.\n\nExpedited approval of projects is part of Trump's approach to a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for other infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through a regulatory maze.\n\nTransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until Obama rejected it in 2015. The company resubmitted its application for the project in January, after Trump signed the executive order smoothing its path.\n\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington, Luciana Lopez in New York, Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru, and Denny Thomas in Toronto; Writing by Richard Valdmanis and Jeff Mason; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Matthew Lewis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pipeline-keystone-transcanada-idUSKBN16V1CN"}, {"title": "Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn", "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Obamacare was \"exploding\" after Republican lawmakers shelved legislation that would have dismantled the healthcare law.\n\nThat's not going to happen this month. Probably not even this year.\n\nThe more than 12 million people who bought 2017 health insurance plans on HealthCare.gov and other websites the law created are not in danger of losing their healthcare or having their premiums go up right now, experts say.\n\nBut 2018 is another story.\n\nRepublicans could choose to pass a budget that defunds Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies, which help low-income people cover out-of-pocket and other medical costs. But that would be highly unpopular among consumers who would likely blame the president and Congress for skyrocketing healthcare costs, experts said.\n\n\"That is one of the ways that is available to monkey wrench the Affordable Care Act,\" said Morgan Tilleman, an associate with the law firm Foley & Lardner, who represents insurers.\n\nObamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, has had a tough beginning. The mix of sick and healthy customers has been worse than expected, and premium rates on the individual insurance market went up 25 percent this year.\n\nOther parts of the law, like the expansion of Medicaid to enhance coverage for the poor, and changes to allow young people to stay on their parents' health plans, have been popular. And the defeat of the bill is a win for the hospitals that have benefited from those increased Medicaid dollars.\n\nBut many counties across the country have only one insurer, after Humana Inc, Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc pulled out after reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of losses.\n\nThe insurers who are left, Anthem Inc and other BlueCross BlueShield insurers across the country, as well as smaller players like Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc need to decide in the next few months where to sell insurance and how much to charge.\n\nAnd that is where the market's slow burn takes off, with insurers leaving and premiums rising.\n\nJeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on health care, said that for consumers, 2018 looks uncertain, with a \"death spiral\" of decreasing competition and increasing premium rates ramping up.\n\nLOOKING TO 2018\n\nAfter the failed Republican effort to push through the bill, insurers are looking at changes to help 2018, America's Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow said.\n\nThat includes the market's cost-sharing subsidies as well as other government payments for sicker-than-usual customers and finalizing a rule the Trump administration proposed that addresses issues insurers say drives up costs.\n\nThe Trump administration could do some of that itself if it wants to, such as using its regulatory authority to adjust the formula for how it compensates insurers for the sickest people, Elizabeth Carpenter at healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said.\n\nBut it is unknown if the administration will try to work within the law's existing framework or take actions to undermine it and blame the Democrats for its failure.\n\n\"If they fail to act and they don't act in an appropriate way, that will further destabilize the marketplace,\" Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, said. Molina's enrollment ballooned to 1 million exchange enrollees this year and the company is weighing if it will submit plans for next year.\n\nThe administration could also decide to not enforce the individual mandate, which requires that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a fine. It already took steps to erode that provision last month, when it backed off implementing tougher oversight that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes.\n\nExperts said the individual mandate still cost less than purchasing insurance, but as it increases each year more young and healthy people would have incentive to join the healthcare market, helping to offset the cost of sicker patients.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million more people would be uninsured under the Republican bill next year, with most of the increase coming from the repeal of the penalty associated with the individual mandate.\n\nIt's unclear what the Republicans will do. Trump said this bill had been shelved but that Republicans would end up with a \"great\" healthcare bill in the future, but for now that they are moving onto tax reform.\n\nUntil they do that, they will have to work within the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It can also undercut the healthcare law through regulatory authority at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer and Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-industry-analysis-idUSKBN16W00V"}, {"title": "Instant View: Republicans pull Obamacare repeal bill", "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) walks to a a news conference after Republicans pulled the American Health Care Act bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act act known as Obamacare, prior to a vote at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, March 24, 2017.

There were worries going into it... but it's a mixed bag.\n\n\"It does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare.\n\n\"In a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it's great. Let's move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.\"\n\nPETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS:\n\n\"The market is relieved it's not going to go down to a defeat, and it's hopeful they'll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.\"\n\n\"News report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they're pulling it so they can work on it.\"\n\nMAZEN ISSA, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK:\n\n\"The last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.\"\n\nPARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON:\n\n\"The initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it's a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It's more a knee jerk reaction.\n\n\"There are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can't force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.\n\n\"If this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.\"\n\nRAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK:\n\n\"From an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he's proposing.\n\n\"In one sense that's a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump's more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.\n\n\"You could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that's unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.\"\n\nLOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO:\n\n\"I think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.\"\n\nPETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK:\n\n\"I don't think it's going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.\n\n\"This is now an indication that the president's agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn't have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.\n\n\"There is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside.\n\n\"The fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can't pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn't even include the Democrats. It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.\"\n\nMARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON:\n\n\"It looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they've taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that's so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.\"\n\nBRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO:\n\n\"It didn't pass and it didn't fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON In the end, the Closer couldn\u2019t close the deal.\n\nFor President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support.\n\nIt brings into question the neophyte president\u2019s ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold \"drain-the-swamp\" promises to shake up Washington.\n\nThe White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver.\n\n\"This is the most consequential day of Trump's presidency and it's not just a failure, it's a stunning failure,\u201d Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.\n\nTrump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trump's ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system.\n\n\u201cWe learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,\u201d Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities.\n\nIt was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nTrump\u2019s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill.\n\nThe president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.\n\nTrump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,\u201d said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nRepresentative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.\n\n\"Sometimes you\u2019re playing fantasy football and sometimes you\u2019re in the real game,\u201d Barton told Reuters.\n\nRepresentative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it \u201ca big blow\" for the Republican agenda.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to engage the bill\u2019s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didn't seem to mind, calling Trump a \"great closer.\")\n\nBut even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered.\n\nStuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump\u2019s strong-arm tactics backfired.\n\n\u201cThreats don't work in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cause damage to relationships. They definitely don't work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed.\u201d\n\nESCAPING A LOOMING DISASTER\n\nAfter the bill was revised along Trump\u2019s specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.\n\nThe CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose.\n\nRepresentative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a small-business owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. \u201cThere are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same.\u201d\n\nThe lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryan\u2019s office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives.\n\nCongress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trump's healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich.\n\nThere was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months.\n\nAnd if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls.\n\nInstead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal.\n\n\u201cThis is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right,\u201d said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to \"start over.\"\n\nIt is unclear when that could happen. \"This bill is dead,\u201d said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Richard Cowan and Joseph Ax; Editing by Jason Szep and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-trump-analysis-idUSKBN16W01D"}, {"title": "Planned Parenthood sees brief reprieve after healthcare bill yanked", "text": "NEW YORK Planned Parenthood, the national health organization that would have lost federal funding under sweeping healthcare overhaul legislation, views the withdrawal of the bill on Friday as a temporary reprieve, not the end of a threat to its existence.\n\nOfficials of the organization - long a target of those who oppose its abortion services - anticipate further attempts by Republicans to curb its participation in federally funded public health programs, a major source of its funding.\n\nIn a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives leaders pulled the healthcare bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the party's most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes.

Before winning the presidential election in November, Trump had also promised to defund Planned Parenthood, and fought to get the healthcare bill passed.\n\n\"I'm confident the Republicans in Congress and the president will move ahead and defund Planned Parenthood,\" said Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life.\n\nThe issue \"is so dear to the electorate who put the Republicans and president in office,\" he said after the bill was pulled.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, Georges Benjamin, the American Public Health Association's executive director, welcomed the withdrawal of the legislation, and said the renewed public attention on Planned Parenthood may make future efforts to limit its funding more difficult.\n\n\"I think in many ways it's going to be harder for them to go after Planned Parenthood, not that they won't,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"I hope people recognize that Planned Parenthood did more than abortions, that they recognize it has a broader portfolio,\" he said, referring to services such as cancer screenings provided by the organization.\n\nPUBLIC SUPPORT\n\nThe proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed many parts of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Democratic President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010.\n\nCharbonneau and other Planned Parenthood officials pointed to a widespread outpouring of public opposition to AHCA as one of the reasons that its moderate Republican backers could not reach a compromise with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who demanded a complete evisceration of Obamacare.\n\n\"The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!\" Trump wrote in a message on Twitter on Friday morning.Public opinion polls found the AHCA bill was unpopular among Americans, including Republican voters, and that there was broad public support for funding some of Planned Parenthood's work. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted last month, almost half of 5,459 American adults surveyed said Planned Parenthood should receive federal funding; about a third said they should not.\n\nEven so, about 70 percent of those people said Planned Parenthood should get the money when they were asked about specific services such as free cancer screenings, contraception and prenatal care. Women were significantly more likely than men to think the organization deserved funding.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Federation of America had described the Republicans' proposed law as containing a \"long list of anti-women's health provisions\" in a statement earlier this week. The federation's president, Cecile Richards, cheered its withdrawal on Friday.\n\nThe organization said that 2.5 million men, women and children rely on Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings, medical testing, contraception, abortions and other healthcare services each year at around 700 health centers around the country.\n\nThe warnings were echoed by two dozen national public health organizations, including the American Public Health Association, the American Nurses Association and the American College of Nurse-Midwives, in a letter to U.S. lawmakers in February. They argued that in some parts of the country, particularly rural areas, Planned Parenthood was the only nearby provider of health services.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Allen and Jilian Mincer in New York; Additional reporting Letitia Stein in Tampa; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-planned-parenthood-idUSKBN16W00B"}, {"title": "With healthcare bill dead, Republicans turn to taxes", "text": "FILE PHOTO: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) speaks with the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 14, 2017.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet with senior Turkish officials in Ankara next week, in talks that could be vital to an advancing U.S.-backed campaign to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State, U.S. officials said on Friday.\n\nTurkey has been pressing the United States to drop its military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it considers part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey.\n\nBut U.S. officials have long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to an approaching assault on Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital. It would work alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nInstead, Turkey wants the United States to draw from Syrian Arab rebel groups backed by Ankara for the final assault on Raqqa, a predominantly Arab city, proposals that so far have failed to convince U.S. officials who are not certain that the Turkish-backed Arab force is large and well-trained enough.\n\n\"We first need to work out details with Turkey,\" one senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe decision sets President Donald Trump's wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain the United States' longstanding strategic alliance with Turkey, a NATO ally which provides the United States access to a base critical for the air war in Syria.\n\nThe Raqqa campaign appears to be gathering steam as an overlapping U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from the city of Mosul.\n\nFrench Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the battle for Raqqa would likely start \"in the coming days.\"\n\nThe head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia told Reuters last week that the assault would begin at the start of April, and that the YPG would be taking part.\n\nSome U.S. officials think that timeline is too optimistic, noting that a major battle underway for Tabqa dam, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Raqqa, could take weeks to complete.\n\nThe Pentagon also has said the United States has not decided on the composition of an American-backed assault force in Raqqa.\n\nThe United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria at the moment, and the Raqqa campaign could involve hundreds more.\n\nKURDISH CONUNDRUM\n\nSenator John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee's chairman, suggested to reporters earlier this week that it would be hard to convince Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan of the merits of backing Kurdish fighters, even if they are the most effective weapon against Islamic State.\n\n\"The conundrum is that if you don't use the Kurds, it will take a lot longer while (Islamic State is) sending streams of terrorists out of Raqqa,\" McCain said.\n\n\"But if you do, you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with Turkey is concerned,\" he added.\n\nMcCain said the relationship with Erdogan was particularly important and cited an April 16 referendum on constitutional changes to extend his powers.\n\nSAFE ZONES\n\nTillerson's meeting in Ankara also closely follows a meeting of 68 coalition partners this week in Washington, where they agreed to intensify the fight against Islamic State, including in Syria.\n\nAt Wednesday's meeting, Tillerson said the United States would create \"interim zones of stability\" through ceasefires to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.\n\nHe did not elaborate, although one U.S. official said there was not yet agreement among all American agencies on where and how such zones would be set up.\n\nThe U.S. military has long been skeptical of creating safe zones inside Syria or Iraq, partly because any safe zone guaranteed by the United States almost certainly would require some American military protection. Securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops, former U.S. officials and experts say.\n\nThe top U.S. commander on the ground, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said earlier in March that, \"We are building safe zones right now for all Iraqis and all Syrians to be safe from (Islamic State).\"\n\nIncreased U.S. or allied air power would be required if Trump chooses to enforce \"no fly\" restrictions and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas.\n\nThe State Department did not provide more details of Tillerson's trip to Turkey, but said he will visit Brussels on March 31 to participate in a rescheduled meeting of NATO foreign ministers.\n\nThe NATO meeting had been set for April 5-6, but it was rescheduled after Tillerson decided instead to attend a summit with China. That caused unease among European allies already worried about Trump's commitment to the Western military alliance.\n\n(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by John Walcott and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-tillerson-idUSKBN16V2EE"}, {"title": "Trump touts Charter hiring that was in works for two years", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted Charter Communications Inc's decision to invest $25 billion in the United States and a plan the company announced before he was elected to hire 20,000 workers over four years.\n\nAt a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable company's Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States.\n\nMuch of the announcement was not new.

Others have yet to announce their intentions.\n\nGorsuch is headed toward a Senate Judiciary Committee vote, likely on April 3, on his nomination to the high court after a marathon four-day confirmation hearing this week.\n\nAfter that, it is not yet clear how much of a fight Democrats will put up when the nomination is due for a final vote in the 100-member Senate, where there are 52 Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic opposition to Gorsuch could prompt a showdown in the Senate and delay the judge's confirmation but ultimately the Republicans are likely to win that fight and avoid another setback in Congress for Trump who suffered a blow on Friday when lawmakers pulled a major healthcare bill.\n\nSenate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation's highest court. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2nANgEj)\n\nBut the Senate's Republican leadership could adopt a rule change allowing a vote that would only require a simple majority of the chamber. If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.\n\nFor Democrats, putting up a fight would at least frustrate Trump and placate liberal activists sore about the Republican-led Senate\u2019s refusal to vote on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the same open seat on the court last year.\n\nIf eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.\n\nDEMOCRATS TARGETED\n\nConservative activists were targeting ten Democrats running for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won in the presidential election as possible \"yes\" votes for Gorsuch among Democrats.\n\nOf that number, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have already announced their opposition to the nomination. The other seven, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to announce their plans.\n\nAnother Democratic senator under pressure from both sides on Gorsuch is Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuch\u2019s home state of Colorado. Bennet has yet to announce his position.\n\nRepublicans are also hopeful that some Democratic members of the judiciary committee, including Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, might be wary of blocking a vote on the nominee. Their spokesmen did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be an \"unprecedented, even nuclear step\" to require a 60-vote threshold before the Senate can vote on the nominee.\n\n\"There has never, in the history of the Republic, ever been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee,\" he added.\n\nThe last attempt to filibuster a nominee was a Democratic bid to block a vote on Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005. Democrats failed to gather enough support and the Senate voted 72-25 to proceed to an up-or-down vote. Alito was eventually confirmed by 58-42.\n\nSarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Democrats may be able to gather enough support to block a vote because so few of them are moderates from Republican-leaning states, meaning they may feel they have little to lose.

Most of the gains have come as investors embraced prospects for the pro-growth and pro-business agenda Trump touted during his campaign.\n\nBut more recently, doubts have arisen over Trump's ability to deliver on the agenda as the effort to repeal Obamacare grew more rancorous.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo\n\nA U.S. federal judge in Virginia ruled on Friday that President Donald Trump's travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision took an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga rejected arguments by Muslim plaintiffs who claimed Trump's March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of all refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries was discriminatory.\n\nThe decision went against two previous court rulings that put an emergency halt to the order before it was set to take effect on March 16. The order remains halted.\n\nTrump has said he plans to appeal those unfavorable rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed, and differing opinions by lower courts give more grounds for the highest court to take up the case.\n\nTrenga, an appointee of Republican President George W.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON The top U.S. Senate Democrat on Thursday pledged to pursue a procedural hurdle to try to block the confirmation of Republican President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, a move that could provoke a nasty partisan fight and change the way the Senate does business.\n\nRepublicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate, leaving Democrats with an uphill battle to prevent Gorsuch's confirmation. But Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation's highest court.\n\nTrump has called on Senate Republicans to change the long-standing rules in order to allow a simple majority vote on confirmation if Democrats mount a filibuster. If eventually confirmed as expected, the federal appeals court judge from Colorado would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court, fulfilling one of Trump's top campaign promises.\n\nAs the Judiciary Committee completed its fourth and final day of Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the spotlight turned to whether he gains the support of vulnerable Democratic senators facing re-election in 2018. The support of eight Democrats would short-circuit a filibuster.\n\n\"After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court,\" Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor, a day after Gorsuch finished marathon Judiciary Committee testimony.\n\n\"He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be 'no,' and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer called Schumer's remarks \"truly disappointing\" and urged him to abandon the filibuster threat, saying it was the type of partisanship Americans have grown tired of. Spicer said Trump, in light of Schumer's comments, would discuss Senate confirmation strategy with Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nConservative activists have said they have identified 10 possible \"yes\" votes for Gorsuch among Democrats seeking 2018 re-election in states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Casey, up for re-election in 2018 in one of those states, Pennsylvania, announced he would vote against Gorsuch and support a filibuster.\n\n'RIGID AND RESTRICTIVE'\n\n\"I don't believe that Judge Gorsuch, his judicial approach, would ensure fairness for workers and families in Pennsylvania,\" Casey said, expressing \"serious concerns about Judge Gorsuch's rigid and restrictive judicial philosophy.\"\n\nCasey said he was unaware of any discussions among Democrats about a deal to advance Gorsuch's nomination in return for a guarantee from Republicans that the next Supreme Court nomination would need 60 votes to proceed to a Senate confirmation vote.\n\nDemocratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, facing re-election in Wisconsin next year, also opposes the nomination, a spokesman said. West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Florida's Bill Nelson, Democrats facing voters next year, remain undecided on Gorsuch, their spokesmen told Reuters.\n\nSeveral Judiciary Committee Democrats, including its top Democrat Dianne Feinstein, declined to comment on whether they would support a filibuster.\n\nAnother vote potentially up for grabs is that of Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Gorsuch's home state of Colorado. He is not up for re-election next year and his state voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He introduced Gorsuch to the Judiciary Committee on Monday, but did not commit to supporting confirmation, promising an \"open mind.\"\n\nSchumer said if Gorsuch cannot attract 60 votes, \"the answer isn't to change the rules. It's to change the nominee.\" Schumer said Gorsuch failed to convince him he would be \"an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint from executive overreach\" or that he would be a neutral justice \"free from the biases of politics and ideology.\"\n\nDemocratic committee members on Tuesday and Wednesday pressed Gorsuch on rulings he participated in that they said showed a inclination to decide in favor of corporate interests and against what they called \"the little guy.\" Democrats expressed frustration about his refusal to answer questions on whether Supreme Court rulings favoring abortion, contraception and gay rights were correctly decided.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee was due to vote on the nomination on April 3.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON In the middle of a confused three-day scramble by U.S. Republicans to save their plan to dismantle Obamacare, President Donald Trump telephoned a former small-town sandwich shop owner from the North Carolina mountains on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows took the call during a meeting of the Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction of the House of Representatives he chairs. His talk with Trump thrust Meadows into the eye of a legislative storm that led to a pivotal vote on the bill being postponed. Then, late on Thursday after Trump demanded action by the House, a final vote was set for Friday.\n\nThrough it all, Meadows has been a key player in Trump's first major legislative initiative, an effort as chaotic and unpredictable as his campaign for the White House, with its ultimate outcome still in doubt late on Thursday night.\n\nAfter promising for months as a candidate to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has still not produced his own plan to do so, choosing instead to support a rollback bill drafted by senior House Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nFinancial markets have watched the drama over the bill nervously, concerned that defeat or delay for it could undermine Trump's ability to carry through on promises to cut taxes and reduce regulation that have lifted U.S. stocks for weeks.\n\nIn a schism among Republicans who now control Congress and the White House, moderates oppose Ryan's bill, saying it goes too far. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would result in 24 million fewer Americans having insurance by 2026 than if Obamacare remained in place intact.\n\nMeadows and the Freedom Caucus don't like it either, but for very different reasons, making a compromise challenging. They say it doesn't go far enough to repeal the healthcare law put in place in 2010 by former Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nTo deal with this problem, Trump stepped in personally earlier this week to try to win over Meadows and his maverick conservative faction, according to interviews with dozens of lawmakers and congressional aides. But, even after marathon phone calls and meetings at the White House, Trump, who prides himself as a master negotiator, failed to secure the deal.\n\nMeadows told reporters on Thursday night he still opposed the bill, but was optimistic that a deal could be reached. \"I am still a no,\" he said, taking basically the same position he took on Wednesday afternoon after his phone call with Trump.\n\nLEANING RIGHT\n\nWhen he embraced Ryan's bill and then decided to intervene to try to save it, Trump opted for a strategy in which he would concentrate on winning over Meadows and the conservatives.\n\nRyan and House leaders would deal with \"everybody else,\" Republican Representative Tom Rooney said Thursday. That strategic approach soon had embarrassing consequences.\n\nTrump's push began in earnest on Tuesday, when he visited Capitol Hill seeking support for the plan among Republicans.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Rules Committee held marathon meetings to finalize the bill that would go to the floor.\n\nAfter his Wednesday phone call with the president, Meadows spent much of Wednesday night negotiating with Trump, said a Republican lawmaker.\n\n\"Mark Meadows has been at the White House more in the last 48 hours than any other times in his life combined,\" said one conservative lobbyist with knowledge of internal discussions.\n\nAs Meadows and other Freedom Caucus members such as Representative Jim Jordan negotiated with Trump, more and more right-wing amendments were added to the bill to placate conservatives.\n\nThe conservative concessions hurt moderates. \"The vast majority of us in the Republican conference have been left out of these discussions,\" Representative Bradley Byrne said Thursday. \"That is a growing problem for our leadership and I think it's a growing problem for the chances of this bill.\"\n\nRYAN BALKS\n\nAt some point, Ryan himself balked when he learned of the agreements struck between Trump and the conservatives, according to the conservative lobbyist, setting in motion a frantic push to save a vote on the bill that had been set for Thursday.\n\nBy late afternoon, that rescue effort had collapsed and the vote was scrapped. Trump responded forcefully, dispatching top White House lieutenants to a meeting with lawmakers with a clear message: the president was done negotiating.\n\nThe message was \"it's done tomorrow or Obamacare stays,\" said Republican Representative Chris Collins.\n\nWith that, lawmakers announced that a decisive vote on the bill would be held on Friday afternoon.\n\nEarlier, even as the vote that had been set for Thursday was falling apart, Trump was meeting with trucking industry representatives and gleefully climbed into the cab of an 18-wheeler. He said then that everyone would find out in a couple of hours whether Republicans had enough votes to pass the healthcare bill, unaware that the vote had already been delayed.\n\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton, Susan Cornwell, Julia Edwards Ainsley, Amanda Becker, Steve Holland and Richard Cowan; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Paul Tait)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-talks-idUSKBN16V14N"}, {"title": "Republican Nunes apologizes over handling of Trump surveillance claim", "text": "WASHINGTON The Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee apologized on Thursday for the way he handled sensitive allegations about U.S. spy agency surveillance of President Donald Trump's team.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes was criticized by colleagues on Wednesday for calling a news conference to announce that the communications of members of the team that ran Trump's transition to the presidency were swept up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners.\n\nDemocrats were upset that Nunes made the comments to the media and then briefed Trump in the White House without informing them.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nSEATTLE A U.S. tax overhaul proposed by Republican leaders in Congress would deepen divisions between big manufacturers like Boeing Co and the thousands of smaller companies that supply them, according to suppliers and tax and trade experts.\n\nU.S. automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals, which would tax imports at a 20 percent rate, and could split these sectors into winners and losers.\n\nThe revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry, where Boeing's aggressive cost-cutting driven by fierce competition with European rival Airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad.\n\nAerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching Boeing's factories in Washington and South Carolina. U.S.-based suppliers to Boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. Boeing, the top exporter among U.S. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free.\n\nBoeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as United Technologies Corp, General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the Republican tax package.\n\nThe plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which President Donald Trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible.\n\nLawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff.\n\nSUPPLIERS CONCERNED\n\nIf the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, Norfil Complex Machining, a 40-employee company in Pacific, Washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from Russia. The metal goes into parts Norfil makes for Boeing landing gear that get assembled in Japan.\n\n\"A lot of Russian titanium goes into planes,\" said Doren Spinner, Norfil's CEO. His purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax \"would end up affecting what the plane would cost,\" he says.\n\nOther companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low-cost locations abroad.\n\n\"If the taxes are ridiculous, we'd just have to think of something creative,\" said Paul Doran, a sales manager at Mifa, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aalberts Industries NV that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. \"I think most companies would be in the same boat.\"\n\nColin Frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier Carr Lane Manufacturing Co in St. Louis, Missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. \"We'd end up splitting up the company and I don't think that's necessarily good for the U.S. economy,\" he said.\n\nBoeing said it was too soon to judge the plan's effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain.\n\n\"These assessments will vary by company, and it's premature to speculate or generalize,\" Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said.\n\nOUTSOURCING CONUNDRUM\n\nBoeing was among about 90 companies, including many suppliers, that signed a letter this month from the Aerospace Industries Association urging Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax system. Boeing also is part of the American Made Coalition, an industry group that backs Republican tax proposals.\n\nProponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and would encourage companies to invest in the United States.\n\nThe tax overhaul could have cut Boeing's taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a Reuters analysis of Boeing's 2016 deliveries. Two-thirds of Boeing's jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. Worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate.\n\nBoeing would face import taxes, too. Its 787 Dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Italy's Leonardo SpA.\n\nBoeing also would still pay tax on sales to U.S. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally.\n\nYet suppliers say Boeing's vigorous cost-saving has pressed many to outsource production to low-cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax.\n\nU.S. aerospace imports have doubled the past decade, with Mexico the fastest-growing source, up 950 percent since 2006. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2n4A8o1)\n\nSupply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said David Wireman, managing director and co-head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\n\"The tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Joe White and Tomasz Janowski)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-manufacturing-analysis-idUSKBN16V0I1"}, {"title": "Washington talks end without agreement on Israeli settlements", "text": "WASHINGTON The Trump administration reiterated its concerns about Israeli settlement activity, the two sides said on Thursday, as a round of talks ended without agreement over limiting future construction on land the Palestinians want for a state.\n\nThe four days of high-level meetings in Washington marked the latest step by President Donald Trump\u2019s aides aimed at opening the way to renewed peace diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians, despite deep skepticism in the United States and Middle East over the chances for success.\n\nTrump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who recently returned from a visit to the region, led the U.S. delegation in what were described as \u201cintensive discussions\u201d with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter.\n\nDespite setting a more positive tone toward Israel than his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump urged Netanyahu during a White House visit last month to \u201chold back on settlements for a little bit.\u201d The two then agreed that their aides would seek an accommodation on how much Israel can build and where.\n\n\u201cThe United States delegation reiterated President Trump\u2019s concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement,\u201d according to a joint statement released by the White House.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli delegation made clear that Israel\u2019s intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration,\" it said. \"The talks were serious and constructive, and they are ongoing.\"\n\nPeace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and settlements are one of the most heated issues.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump warned House Republican lawmakers that he will leave Obamacare in place and move on to tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on Friday.\n\nIt was not clear late on Thursday evening that Trump and the Republican leaders who crafted the bill had enough support to pass it, meaning they now risk defeat in their first attempt at major legislation and may fail to deliver on a key campaign pledge.\n\n\"We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it\u2019s collapsing and it\u2019s failing families, and tomorrow we\u2019re proceeding,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after an evening all-hands meeting. He ignored reporters who asked if he had secured the votes to pass the bill.\n\nRyan and leaders in the House of Representatives were forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, earlier on Thursday, dealing Trump an embarrassing setback.\n\nThe vote had been symbolically planned for the anniversary of former Democratic President Barack Obama signing his namesake healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, in 2010. It was supposed to have been Trump's first legislative victory.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans had pledged to replace Obamacare, which they view as too intrusive and too expensive.\n\nBut, after a week of calling Republican lawmakers and bringing them into the Oval Office for meetings, Trump failed to close the deal with two different factions within his party on time for the planned Thursday vote.\n\nConservatives felt the bill did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare and moderates felt the plan could hurt their constituents. House Republican leaders had signaled they were ready to work through the weekend to figure out a way to reconcile their differences.\n\nAs the healthcare drama unfolded on Capitol Hill, Trump played it cool, taking a break from negotiations to hang out with some truckers, climbing into the cab of a long-haul transport truck parked on the back driveway of the White House, and blowing the horn a few times.\n\nHe told reporters the vote would be close but he remained optimistic. \"I think we\u2019re doing well. We\u2019ll find out in about three hours,\" he said, just as reports began to surface that the vote had been postponed.\n\nBy evening, Trump sent his top lieutenants to a dramatic meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday night with an ultimatum: he was done talking. According to Representative Chris Collins of New York, a top Trump ally, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told House Republicans that Trump wanted a vote.\n\n\"The president has said he wants a vote tomorrow, up or down,\" Collins said.\n\n\"If for any reason it is down, we are just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda\" such as tax reform, Collins told reporters after leaving the meeting.\n\nHowever, the vote has been seen by financial markets as a crucial test of Trump's ability to work with Congress to deliver on his other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\n\nEven if their replacement plan does eventually get approval from the House, the legislation faces a potentially tough fight in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe House and Senate had hoped to deliver a new healthcare bill to Trump by April 8, when Congress is scheduled to begin a two-week spring break.\n\nGETTING TO YES?\n\nThe Republicans have a majority in the House but, because of united Democratic opposition, can afford to lose only 21 Republican votes. By Thursday morning, NBC News said that 30 Republicans had planned to vote \"no\" or were leaning that way.\n\nNorth Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, the chairman of the pivotal conservative bloc known as the Freedom Caucus, said he and others were struggling to support the plan.\n\n\"I am desperately trying to get to \u2018yes\u2019 and I think the president knows that. I told him that personally,\" Meadows said. However, after Thursday night's meeting, he was still a 'no'.\n\nObamacare aimed to boost the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Some 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.\n\nThe House replacement plan would rescind the taxes created by Obamacare, repeal a penalty against people who do not buy coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, and modify tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans.\n\nHouse leaders agreed to four pages of last-minute amendments to the bill, including allowing states to choose which \"essential benefits\" are required in healthcare insurance plans, and keeping a 0.9 percent surcharge on Medicare for high-income Americans for six years. It was unclear whether that was enough.\n\nRepresentative Trent Franks, a Freedom Caucus member who had been \u201cundeclared\u201d on his position on the bill, said he liked the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d Franks said outside the House.\n\nThe amendments will give states more money for maternal health and mental health, said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska moderate who still has not said how he will vote.\n\nMARKETS WATCHING CLOSELY\n\nUncertainty over the healthcare bill rattled financial markets this week. The delay in the house vote is likely to extend the ups and downs in the stocks of some hospital groups and health insurers.\n\nU.S. stock markets rose steadily in recent months on optimism over a pro-business Trump agenda but fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that failure to push through the healthcare bill could postpone other business-friendly Trump priorities.\n\n\"Delay on healthcare equates to delay on tax cuts. That is why the market turned red when the news flow suggested they didn't have a deal,\" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, a money management firm.\n\nOthers said it was too soon to panic.\n\n\"If this thing gets materially delayed or if we get a 'no' vote, we're going to see a horrific market reaction. But if they vote in the morning and it passes, we'll have a hell of a rally,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nGraphic on Obamacare and Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)\n\nGraphic on shifting positions in the U.S. Senate on Republican healthcare bill (tmsnrt.rs/2mUE4Xf)\n\nGraphic on poll on Americans' views of the Republican healthcare bill ( tmsnrt.rs/2n7f3e4)\n\n(Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, David Morgan, David Lawder, Amanda Becker, Eric Beech, Eric Walsh, Steve Holland, Jeff Mason, Caroline Humer, Megan Davies, Emily Stephenson, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Jennifer Ablan, Noel Randewich, Lewis Krauskopf, and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Frances Kerry and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Michael Perry, Bill Trott and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16U14Q"}, {"title": "Obamacare supporters rally against congressional repeal efforts", "text": "Activists protest against the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare during a rally in Freedom Plaza in Washington March 23, 2017.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON Supporters of Obamacare staged rallies across the country on Thursday denouncing efforts by President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders to repeal the landmark law that has extended medical insurance coverage to some 20 million Americans.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators turned out in Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles marking the seventh anniversary of enactment of Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has become widely known.\n\nMany talked about a very personal stake in the outcome of the healthcare debate roiling Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I feel sick today, but I came here because I'm terrified,\" said Steve Martin, 27, an unemployed Los Angeles resident who was diagnosed with cancer a year ago. \"The legislators have the best healthcare in the world, and we deserve the same.\"\n\nThe ACA, considered former Democratic President Barack Obama's premiere domestic achievement, has drawn unrelenting scorn from Republicans, with promises to repeal and replace it a centerpiece of Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nThursday's rallies coincided with planned action in the House of Representatives on a Republican-backed bill to begin dismantling Obamacare, but the vote was indefinitely postponed as Republican leaders and the White House scrambled to muster enough votes for passage.\n\nMany moderate Republicans as well as Democrats have raised concerns that repeal-and-replace would leave too many Americans without health coverage.\n\nSupporters of the bill say it would lower premiums, but critics counter that those savings would in many cases be more than offset by higher co-pays and other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nObamacare backers also worry about the fate of millions who gained insurance under the bill's major expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state program providing coverage for the needy, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nIn the nation's capital, several hundred chanting protesters gathered at Freedom Plaza, a few blocks from the White House, carrying signs with slogans such as \u201cWe Fight Back\" and \"Keep America Healthy.\u201d\n\nRobinette Barmer, 61, a former seamstress and caterer from Baltimore now on a disability pension, said that without Obamacare she could not afford the various medications she takes for ailments such as asthma and high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s co-pay this, co-pay that. I can\u2019t pay that. I\u2019m struggling as it is right now,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the rally, protesters marched a block to the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, where several dozen sprawled on the sidewalk in a \"die-in\" symbolizing the effect of rolling back Obamacare. Some 24 protesters were arrested in front of the White House after they refused get off the ground, organizers said.\n\nProtest organizers said smaller gatherings were also held outside the congressional district offices of various Republican lawmakers around the country.\n\n(Additional reporting by Olga Grigoryants in Los Angeles and Robert Chiarito in Chicago; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Leslie Adler and Michael Perry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-protest-idUSKBN16U378"}, {"title": "Trump to nominate businessman Hagerty as Japan ambassador-White House", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump intends to nominate businessman William Hagerty as the next U.S. ambassador to Japan, the White House said on Thursday.\n\nHagerty is a Tennessee native who founded a private equity firm, Hagerty Peterson.

The two then held summit talks in Washington and Florida in February.\n\nHowever, Trump has criticized Japan, along with China and Germany, for having large trade imbalances with the United States and has worried Tokyo by calling on allies to pay more for their defense.\n\nTrump also disappointed Japan by withdrawing the United States from a 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact that was the main economic pillar of former President Barack Obama's \"pivot\" of U.S. focus to Asia.\n\nTrump and Abe agreed last month to launch a bilateral economic dialogue, which is due to start next month, to discuss issues such as macroeconomic policies, trade and infrastructure investment, but friction is likely over autos and agriculture.\n\nThis month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Tokyo and underscored the important of the alliance with Japan and of working together to counter the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nKoichi Hori, the chairman of consulting firm Dream Incubator Inc and a former president of Boston Consulting in Japan, who worked with Hagerty in the early 1990s, described him to Reuters in January as a pragmatist who might not always toe Trump's conservative line on trade.\n\nJapanese companies play a key role in the U.S. economy, employing more than 800,000 American workers.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON The Trump administration is preparing new executive orders to re-examine all 14 U.S. free trade agreements and review government procurement policies to aid American companies, two administration officials said.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada will top the list of trade deals to be reviewed, which affect 20 countries from the Americas to Asia, the officials told Reuters. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the orders were still being developed.\n\nThey said on Wednesday that the trade deal and procurement review orders were among several executive actions that the Trump administration is preparing on trade. The timing of the orders is unclear, but they could start to be rolled out next week, the officials said.\n\nPolitico first reported the plan for the two orders, quoting a senior administration official as saying the trade orders would help shift the White House narrative \"to a place where the president can really shine.\"\n\nThe fate of Trump's first major legislative effort in Congress, a measure to replace the 2010 Obamacare health law, remains uncertain amid stiff opposition from conservative Republicans. The House of Representatives had to delay a vote on the bill on Thursday due to insufficient support for the legislation.\n\nThe orders to review existing trade deals and public procurement policies would be largely symbolic, as the administration has already announced its intention to renegotiate NAFTA, with plans to formally notify Congress of its intention to launch talks in the coming weeks.\n\nEarly last month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, \"We're going to re-examine all the current trade deals, figure out if we can improve them.\"\n\nThe U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade deals cover these countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nMedia representatives for the White House and the U.S. Trade Representatives' office declined to comment on any forthcoming executive orders.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he would welcome orders to review trade deals if that means it accelerated negotiations on changing them.\n\n\"I think we've got to start moving,\" Hatch told reporters on Wednesday. \"If he wants to do these unilaterally or bilaterally, he's got to get going on them.\"\n\nTrump's trade officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have long said that NAFTA's rules-of-origin provisions need to be tightened to exclude more components from outside the trading bloc. NAFTA requires cars and trucks to have only 62.5 percent North American content, providing significant opportunities for Asian manufacturers to provide parts.\n\nThe procurement review would be in line with Trump's \"Buy American, Hire American\" campaign push and could win some allies among Democrats in Congress. These include Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who urged the White House in a recent letter to exclude U.S. government contracts from NAFTA and restrict waivers that allow more foreign companies to bid on public procurements.\n\nBut news of the potential trade orders did not impress Republican Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas.\n\n\"I'm more interested in getting our trade representative passed on the Senate floor,\" Roberts told reporters, referring to Robert Lighthizer, Trump's choice for U.S. trade representative, whose nomination has been stalled in the Senate.\n\nRoberts also said he wanted to impress upon the White House the importance of trade deals to boost agricultural exports, including a glut of Kansas wheat, amid what he views as a preoccupation with manufactured exports in the administration.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder and David Shepardson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-trade-idUSKBN16U34K"}, {"title": "Trump's auto review may only slow march to better fuel efficiency", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump arrives aboard Air Force One at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 15, 2017.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nDETROIT When U.S. President Donald Trump announced a review last week of tough Obama-era vehicle emissions and fuel-efficiency standards, he proclaimed that the \"assault on the American auto industry is over.\"\n\nBut rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency may take a backseat to consumers demanding vehicles that guzzle less gas and automakers having to meet tougher standards if they want to export cars overseas, according to auto industry analysts.\n\nIn the end, U.S. carmakers may just gain a few more years to meet the more stringent targets that former President Barack Obama's administration negotiated with the companies in 2012, analysts said.\n\nIf Europe and China continue to toughen their emissions standards, \"the U.S. might become an outlier,\" American Axle President Mike Simonte told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nTrump's move was widely seen leading to a rollback or loosening of more stringent targets, which would slash vehicle exhaust emissions while effectively doubling average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nAutomakers have argued the rules for 2022-2025 are too expensive and could cost American jobs, so the Trump administration\u2019s review was seen as a win for them.\n\nOn a conference call Thursday with investors, Bob Shanks, Ford Motor Co's chief financial officer, said, \u201cWe are not seeking a rollback in any way. We just want to have a conversation around the levels we want to achieve.\u201d\n\nDespite what the EPA may want, California and nine other states in the Zero Emission Vehicle program \u2014 eight in the northeast, plus Oregon \u2014 are expected to move ahead on Friday with the previously established targets.\n\nThose states account for nearly 30 percent of U.S. auto sales.\n\nThe potential divide with the rest of the country could create a \u201ctwo-tiered environment with two sets of regulations,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, managing director of AlixPartners\u2019 automotive practice. This \u201ccould drive costs higher if automakers have to build two versions of the same vehicle to meet the two different standards.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that sued to overturn the Obama-era rules on behalf of several big automakers, wrote the White House on Thursday urging talks to begin quickly with California to ensure that national standards remain in place.\n\n\u201cAutomakers seek certainty, predictability and rationality \u2013 over time \u2013 from the regulatory process,\u201d the group's CEO Mitch Bainwol wrote.\n\n\u201cEPA A DISTANT THIRD\u201d\n\nKristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research\u2019s labor and industry group, said U.S. automakers could find it hard to export cars to markets such as China and Europe with tougher regulatory regimes if the U.S. targets were rescinded.\n\n\u201cI don't think we\u2019re going to see a rollback,\u201d she said. \u201cAt most, I think we may see a slowing of the timetable\u201d for implementing the tougher standards.\n\nAlixPartners\u2019 Wakefield said if China, the world\u2019s largest market, continues pushing electric vehicles while America backpedals, it could lead to \u201csome movement of investment from the U.S. to China, especially as the latter market continues to grow.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV referred Reuters to public comments made by the industry\u2019s lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, said the Obama administration estimated it would cost $200 billion over 13 years to comply with stricter standards, which he believes will lead to higher prices for consumers and jobs leaving the country.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the auto industry expected to miss the 2022-2025 targets regardless of who occupied the White House, but he believes the EPA\u2019s recent move may carry relatively little weight.\n\n\u201cOf all the things that are likely to drive fuel economy, I would rank the EPA a distant third on the list, behind consumer preferences and the direction of technology,\u201d he said.\n\nUnited Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams said while around 60 percent of U.S. auto sales are currently trucks and SUVs, consumers value fuel-economy improvements for those vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe automakers shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of sliding backward,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect our (union) members, but we understand that in doing so we also have to look at the future.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Nick Carey and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-idUSKBN16U30X"}, {"title": "Pence says 'making strong progress' on Republican healthcare bill", "text": "Trump says North Korea problem 'will be taken care of'\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Pyongyang is a problem that \"will be taken care of,\" as speculation rose that North Korea might be on the verge of a sixth nuclear test.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-pence-idUSKBN16U36J"}, {"title": "The Trump presidency on March 23 at 7:03 P.M.

If Clayton recuses himself and the remaining two disagree, any measure before the commission would fail. He stressed he did not see this as a major concern because most enforcement votes are \"unanimous.\"\n\nClayton also said he strongly believes in holding individuals accountable for wrongdoing, adding it could be a greater deterrent than coming down on corporations.\n\nThe SEC only has civil jurisdiction and cannot bring criminal prosecutions.\n\nDemocrats also questioned if Clayton is willing to stand up to Trump and his appointees.\n\nWarren pointed to billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who is advising Trump on regulation, and asked Clayton about Icahn using his high-profile role to boost his own investments.\n\nIcahn has a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from a change he has proposed to the U.S. biofuels program and a 24.57 percent stake in Herbalife Ltd, which is under investigation for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nClayton acknowledged he met with Icahn after he was nominated to discuss the role of activist investors, but was careful not to judge Icahn's roles as investor and White House adviser.\n\nViolations of insider trading laws generally entail a \"facts and circumstances analysis,\" he said.\n\nCurrent and former SEC staff have told Reuters they are confident that Clayton will make a strong SEC chairman.\n\nFormer Republican SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who has known Clayton since the financial crisis, attended the hearing Thursday and gave him high marks.\n\n\"His demeanor is perfectly fitting for an SEC chairman,\" he said.\n\n(Editing by Linda Stern and Jeffrey Benkoe)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-clayton-idUSKBN16U0DL"}, {"title": "Factbox: A look at U.S. healthcare spending as Obamacare repeal looms", "text": "NEW YORK U.S. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed a healthcare law to kick off their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nFollowing are some questions and answers about healthcare spending and health insurance coverage in the United States as Republicans try to throw out President Barack Obama's signature piece of domestic policy, the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nWho is covered by what insurance?\n\nThe majority of America\u2019s 323 million people are covered by either government or private insurance. Less than half of U.S. spending on healthcare is publicly financed, a contrast to the 72 percent average among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A core goal of Obamacare was to cut into the numbers of uninsured and some 20 million people gained coverage under the law.\n\n- 155 million people are covered by employer-based health plans\n\n- 70 million people are in the publicly funded Medicaid program for the poor, including 32 million children\n\n- 56 million older or disabled people receive Medicare\n\n- 15 million people are covered by military healthcare\n\n- 12 million people buy individual insurance on the online shopping exchanges created by Obamacare\n\n- 9 million people purchase unsubsidized health insurance directly\n\n- 6 million people are covered by the Indian Health Service, student health plans and other sources\n\n- About 28 million Americans remain uninsured\n\nThe figures are government estimates. They do not add up to a total of 323 million because some people have more than one type of coverage.\n\nHow much does the country spend?\n\nSpending on healthcare in the United States is about $3.5 trillion a year, representing about 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Current U.S. government estimates are for that spending to outpace economic growth and rise to 20 percent of GDP by 2025. Healthcare spending has been rising faster than inflation. The government estimated it to have risen 4.8 percent in 2016 and that it will increase at an average rate of 5.6 percent through 2025.\n\nWhat does America get for its money?\n\nWhile U.S. healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP ranks higher than for any other OECD country, Americans\u2019 life expectancy is near the bottom in a ranking of other OECD countries, behind countries such as France, Germany and Britain. The country's obesity rate is the highest.\n\nWhat was the impact of Obamacare?\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act was implemented over the past six years, it made sweeping changes to the health insurance system and implemented new taxes, so gutting the law will affect most Americans at some point.\n\nThe law set a series of minimum standards. It introduced free preventive care coverage, mandated most employers to offer insurance and individuals to buy it, expanded the Medicaid program to include people with higher incomes and created income-based subsidies for individuals to draw them into buying insurance. It prevented insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health status and allowed young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance policies.\n\nWhat sectors are feeling the impact now?\n\nRepublicans will tackle repealing Obamacare in multiple steps because while they control both chambers in Congress, they do not have the 60 seats in the 100-seat Senate needed to simply undo the law.\n\nThe first step focuses on insurance sold to individuals and the Medicaid expansion, which could mean diminished payments to hospitals and doctors who benefited from the 20 million people covered by the ACA. They now face uncertain revenues and the possibility of increased bad debt as they lose paying patients.\n\nThe impact on insurers is twofold: uncertainty over who will buy insurance could lead to them mispricing insurance plans and suffering financially as soon as this year. In the longer term, the retrenchment is changing the outlook for the growth rate of publicly backed healthcare.\n\nWhich publicly traded companies does this affect?\n\nThere are only a handful of publicly traded hospital companies, and the biggest one, HCA Holdings Inc, is not focused on states where Medicaid expanded, so it tends not to be involved. Tenet Healthcare Corp and Community Health Systems Inc are smaller hospital chains with high debt loads and their shares do tend to be affected by news about potential cuts to the numbers of Americans with publicly funded healthcare.\n\nThe insurers that specialize in Medicaid and government healthcare such as WellCare Health Plans, Molina Healthcare Inc and Centene Corp are small but tend to move on news that the Medicaid expansion may be repealed and on proposed changes in how the federal government pays its share of all Medicaid costs to the states. Anthem Inc is one of the biggest insurers selling plans on the individual exchanges and may see shares affected by news of rules that could affect who enrolls in insurance.\n\nSources - Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Census Bureau, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Frances Kerry and Bill Trott)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-factbox-idUSKBN16U2BZ"}, {"title": "Trump fights for healthcare bill, makes headway with conservatives", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks up while attending a Women in Healthcare meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2017.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump and House of Representatives leaders pushed on Wednesday for votes for their plan to overhaul Obamacare and said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative Republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation.\n\nWith a vote on the bill possible as soon as Thursday, members of the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative Republican faction, said they had been negotiating alterations to the plan with the White House.\n\nMuch of the discussion hinged on conservatives' desire to scrap what are labeled \"essential health benefits\" - services that insurance plans are required to cover under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, such as mental health help.\n\n\"I can tell you that we're making great progress,\" Mark Meadows, chairman of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters. \"We're not there yet. But we're hopeful.\"\n\nTrump was to meet at the White House with members of the Freedom Caucus on Thursday at 11:30 a.m, the White House said.\n\nBut while the president courted conservatives, the bill appeared to be losing traction among Republican moderates, some of whom attended a meeting late Wednesday in House Speaker Paul Ryan's office. Representative Charlie Dent, a leader of the \"Tuesday Group\" of House Republican moderates, issued a statement saying he could not back the bill.\n\n\"I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low- to moderate-income and older individuals,\" Dent said in the statement.\n\nThe chairman of the House Rules Committee, which met all day Wednesday to set the rules for the bill's consideration on the House floor, said late on Wednesday that the panel would resume its meeting on Thursday, having made no definite decision on the timing of the floor vote.\n\nRepealing and replacing Democratic former President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act is a first major test of Trump\u2019s legislative ability and whether he can keep his big promises to business.\n\nPlans aired by Trump during his election campaign and his first two months in office lifted U.S. stock markets to new highs. But stocks fell back sharply on Tuesday as investors worried that a rough ride for the healthcare legislation could affect his ability to deliver on other big pieces of his agenda, from cutting taxes and regulation to boosting infrastructure.\n\nMajor stock indexes wobbled on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending slightly down and the S&P 500 slightly higher. Investors are eagerly awaiting Thursday\u2019s healthcare vote, which could be pivotal for Trump's broader plans.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus has objected to the bill because its members believe it is still too close to Obamacare.\n\nRepresentative Steve King, a conservative who was among lawmakers who met Trump on Wednesday morning at the White House, said he would now vote for the bill because he got a commitment from Trump to publicly advocate a change to the legislation when it reaches the Senate, eliminating the essential benefits, which also include emergency room visits and maternity and newborn care.\n\n\"I have a full and firm commitment with many witnesses from President Trump,\" King said in a video statement on YouTube.\n\nMeadows said the members of the Freedom Caucus had also discussed the essential benefits with the administration. Conservatives say reducing or scrapping the mandates would bring down insurance premiums.\n\nOn the other side, patient advocates say that not requiring the coverage would hurt both individuals and healthcare providers.\n\n\"It could leave countless people with too little coverage to meet their health care needs and drive higher rates of uncompensated care at hospitals already struggling to cover their costs,\" Bruce Siegel, president of America's Essential Hospitals, said in a statement.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, a Freedom Caucus aide said more than 25 of its members were opposed, enough to stop the bill from passing. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than 21 votes from their own party, since Democrats are united in opposition.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said amending the bill in the Senate would affect procedure, and increase the amount of votes Republicans would need in that chamber. Currently, Republicans intend to pass the plan through budget reconciliation, a process with little room for changes that only requires a simple majority to pass.\n\nHEADWAY\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders also gave signs negotiations were making headway late on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are continuing to move forward and adding new supporters constantly,\" she said. \"As we have indicated previously we are open to changes to the bill that make it better and grow its support.\"\n\nThe primary aim of Obama's signature legislation, passed in 2010, was reducing the numbers of Americans with no health coverage. Twenty million people gained insurance under the law.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people would lose coverage under the Republican plan by next year. It also said 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026.\n\nThe Republican plan would also rescind taxes created by Obamacare, repeal penalties for not buying coverage, slash funding for the Medicaid program for the poor, and modify subsidies that help individuals buy plans.\n\nIn the two weeks since it was unveiled, shares of some hospital operators and health insurers have fallen more than 10 percent.\n\nIf the healthcare bill passes the House, the Senate could take it up next week. Republican leaders hope that if the Senate acts quickly, the bill could go back to the House for a final vote by mid-April, possibly allowing Trump to sign it into law by Easter, April 16.\n\nOpponents of the overhaul have been fiercely vocal, and on Wednesday protesters, many in wheelchairs or with serious medical conditions, blocked the Capitol rotunda for about an hour.\n\n\"Rather go to jail than die without Medicaid,\" they chanted.\n\nCapitol police said they made 54 arrests and later released the protesters.\n\nACA vs. AHCA: tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf\n\nWhere senators stand on the AHCA: tmsnrt.rs/2mUE4Xf\n\nHow Americans feel about the AHCA: tmsnrt.rs/2n7f3e4\n\n(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton, Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey, Jeff Mason, Steve Holland, David Lawder, Eric Walsh and Emily Stephenson in Washington and Megan Davies and Rodrigo Campos in New York; Writing by Frances Kerry and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16T22X"}, {"title": "No. 2 House Republican says healthcare bill debate to start Friday: CNN", "text": "As Trump seeks defense-spending boost, watchdogs cite faulty Pentagon accounting\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald J.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON The U.S. Senate on Thursday narrowly confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee to be ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, an outspoken bankruptcy lawyer aligned with the Israeli right.\n\nThe vote was 52 to 46, almost exclusively along party lines. Only two Democrats, Senators Robert Menendez and Joe Manchin, joined Trump's fellow Republicans in backing Friedman.\n\nThat amount of opposition is highly unusual for a nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, a close ally of the United States. For decades, nominees from both Democratic and Republican presidents have been approved without objection, via unanimous consent or voice votes.\n\nFriedman, who has no diplomatic experience, is a longtime friend of Trump who worked for the Republican former New York businessman as a bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nIn addition to investing in settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians, Friedman favors moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies because both Israel and the Palestinians claim the city as their capital.\n\nFriedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements, such as describing former President Barack Obama as anti-Semitic. Democrats said his approach could risk security in a volatile region.\n\n\"Our ambassador should not be the kind of person who uses language to fuel violence, hate, instability,\" Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said on the Senate floor before the final confirmation vote.\n\nTrump's selection of Friedman reflects his shift in policy toward Israel after years of friction between Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Trump has wavered on the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of Washington's Middle East policy, and backed the embassy's relocation.\n\nWhen Friedman was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also largely along party lines, Republican Senator Bob Corker, the panel's chairman, praised him as an \"impassioned advocate\" for strong U.S.-Israeli ties.\n\n\"He understands the complexity of issues at stake for the United States and the necessity to support a democratic ally in an important and unstable part of the world,\" Corker said.\n\nThursday's vote meant that Trump will have an ambassador in place in time for next week's annual conference in Washington of the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-diplomacy-idUSKBN16U2L5"}, {"title": "House delays vote on healthcare bill: MSNBC", "text": "WASHINGTON The House of Representatives on Thursday delayed a vote on legislation to begin dismantling Obamacare as President Donald Trump and leaders in Congress labored to find enough support among fellow Republicans for their version of a new federal healthcare policy, MSNBC reported, citing multiple House leadership sources\n\nThe reported delay marked a setback for Trump, who is seeking his first major legislative victory and who campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's landmark law.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Bill Trott and Eric Walsh)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-delay-idUSKBN16U2T5"}, {"title": "Senators advised House vote on healthcare unlikely before Monday: aide", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. senators have been informed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that a vote on a Republican repeal and replacement of Obamacare might not be held in the House of Representatives before Monday, according to a senior Senate aide.\n\nThe House had hoped to vote on Thursday on the controversial measure, but has lacked the votes for passage.\n\nMeanwhile, another aide said House leaders might still try to schedule a House floor vote very early Friday.

I mean, that\u2019s OK, he\u2019ll send the Underse ... I mean, that\u2019s OK, he\u2019ll send an Assistan ...

Nunes himself said there is no proof of that, as have other lawmakers of both parties and the FBI director.\n\nA short while later, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited Nunes' comments at his White House news briefing.\n\n\"I do think it is a startling revelation, and there's a lot of questions that need to get asked,\" Spicer said.\n\nDemocrats denounced Nunes' statements as highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee, with the top Democrat on the committee saying its members had not been informed and implying that Nunes was giving political cover to the president.\n\nIntelligence reports about the communications appeared to \"unmask\" the identity of the Trump associates and the names were widely shared among the agencies, Nunes said. He said it was possible Trump's own communications were also collected.\n\nThe National Security Agency routinely collects electronic communications on foreigners through a variety of surveillance tools. But information about Americans is also sometimes incidentally gathered, such as when someone is communicating to a foreign target.\n\nTypically the names of Americans are made anonymous, or masked, in foreign intelligence reports unless an intelligence agency determines the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation. It was unclear why the reports Nunes cited contained unmasked names.\n\nA U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nTwo days ago, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, told a hearing of Nunes' committee that his agency was conducting a criminal investigation of potential links between Trump associates and Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election to benefit Trump.\n\n\"I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community ... collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,\" said Nunes, who was himself on Trump's transition team.\n\nNunes said he was referring to intelligence reports of communications collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\n\"I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he felt \"somewhat\" vindicated by Nunes' announcement after being briefed by Nunes. FBI head Comey on Monday said that Trump's claims were groundless.\n\nAccording to Nunes, the conversations in question were collected legally in November, December and January.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the committee's leading Democrat, Adam Schiff said, \"The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he's going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.\"\n\nNunes' remarks appeared tied to a line of questioning from Republicans during Monday's hearing about the importance of identifying and prosecuting those responsible for intelligence leaks.\n\nRepublicans have focused much of their discussion of the issue on the release of the names, or \"unmasking\" of Trump associates in the investigation. Trump fired his former national security adviser, General Mike Flynn, after the revelation that he had spoken to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the transition - which was leaked to the press after those calls were caught by surveillance intercepts.\n\nNunes appeared to suggest intelligence reports about intercepts other than Flynn's conversations existed.\n\n'PROFOUND IRREGULARITY'\n\nFormer intelligence officials and Democrats said Nunes' announcement was highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee.\n\nSchiff said he was not consulted by Nunes before his news conference. Nunes' decision to share the information with the White House before informing the committee was a \"profound irregularity,\" Schiff said, adding that \"a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.\"\n\nSchiff said the unmasking of a U.S. person may be appropriate in the context of an investigation.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to influence the presidential election in Trump's favor against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation. Russia denies the allegations.\n\nNunes said he was \"very concerned\" about whether U.S. intelligence agencies were spying on Trump. He briefed Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan before the news conference and went to the White House to share the information.\n\nAdmiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, was asked by Republicans at Monday's hearing about the agency's policies for \"unmasking\" the names of Americans whose communications were incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs.\n\nRogers said that 20 NSA employees, including himself, have the authority to unmask the identity of an American\u2019s communications, and that senior officials at the CIA, FBI and Justice Department can make such a request. Asked how many Americans had been unmasked since June 2016, Rogers said he did not know.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Dustin Volz, additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, David Alexander, Mark Hosenball and Tim Ahmann; editing by John Walcott and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-surveillance-idUSKBN16T2GQ"}, {"title": "Hawaii lawmaker resigns from Republican Party to join Democrats", "text": "U.S. Representative Beth Fukumoto is shown in this undated handout photo in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S., provided March 22, 2017.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States would set up \"interim zones of stability\" to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat did not make clear where these zones were to be set up. He was addressing a meeting of 68 countries and organizations gathered in Washington to discuss accelerating the battle against Islamic State.\n\n\"The United States will increase our pressure on ISIS and al Qaeda and will work to establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home,\" Tillerson told the gathering at the State Department, where the former oil executive was hosting his first major diplomatic event.\n\nAlthough it was unclear how the zones would work, creating any safe havens could ratchet up U.S. military involvement in Syria and mark a major departure from President Barack Obama's more cautious approach.\n\nAsked about Tillerson's remarks, coalition spokesman Colonel Joseph Scrocca said the U.S. military had not yet received direction to establish any kind of \"zones\".\n\nIncreased U.S. or allied air power would be required if President Donald Trump chooses to enforce 'no fly' restrictions, and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas.\n\nA final statement at the end of the meeting did not mention the possibility of safe zones.\n\nIslamic State has been losing ground in both Iraq and Syria, with three separate forces, backed by the United States, Turkey and Russia, advancing on the group's Syrian stronghold city of Raqqa.\n\nU.S. defense officials said on Wednesday the U.S.-led coalition has airlifted Syrian rebel forces in an operation near the Syrian town of Tabqa in Raqqa province.\n\n\"I recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating ISIS is the United States\u2019 number one goal in the region,\" Tillerson said.\n\n\"As a coalition we are not in the business of nation building or reconstruction,\" he said, adding that resources should be focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS and equipping war-torn communities to rebuild.\n\nISLAMIC STATE OUTNUMBERED\n\nWednesday's event was the first meeting of the coalition since the election of Trump, who has pledged to make the fight against Islamic State a priority.\n\nTillerson called on coalition partners to make good on financial pledges to secure and rebuild areas where Islamic State has been pushed out. The coalition has pledged more than $2 billion in assistance for Iraq and Syria in 2017.\n\nIraqi government forces, backed by the U.S.-led international coalition, retook several Iraqi cities from Islamic State last year and have liberated eastern Mosul.\n\nWhile the jihadist group is overwhelmingly outnumbered by Iraqi forces, it has been using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend its remaining strongholds.\n\nSpeaking to the same meeting, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for unity in the region to combat Islamic State and outlined Iraq's progress in the fight.\n\nHe said Iraq was now at the stage of \"destroying\" Islamic State, not just \"containing\" it. Recounting a Tuesday conversation with the Iraqi leader, Senator Lindsey Graham said Abadi believed reconstruction of Anbar province as well as Mosul in Nineveh province would cost about $50 billion.\n\n(Additional reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Writing by Yara Bayoumy and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-idUSKBN16T0CQ"}, {"title": "Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 22 at 6:30 P.M.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch said on Wednesday presidents must obey court orders and expressed uncertainty about language in the Constitution barring U.S. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as Democrats grilled him on issues involving President Donald Trump.\n\nGorsuch, the conservative appeals court judge from Colorado nominated by Trump on Jan. 31 to a lifetime job on the nation's highest court, sparred with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats on the third day of his confirmation hearing.\n\nHe completed his testimony on Wednesday night. The committee will complete its deliberations on Thursday by hearing testimony from outside witnesses.\n\nGorsuch seems assured of winning committee approval, moving his nomination to the full Republican-led Senate. His challenge then would be to gather enough Democratic votes to avoid a prolonged floor fight with the potential, if it gets rocky, of changing how the Senate works.\n\nWhile Gorsuch's confirmation process looked to be proceeding smoothly, Democrats pressed him on matters swirling around Trump, even asking him about the standards for impeachment. Gorsuch's expected Senate confirmation would restore a conservative majority on the court and hand the Republican president his biggest achievement in office.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy cited comments by Trump adviser Stephen Miller after courts blocked the president's executive action temporarily banning people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. On Feb. 12, Miller challenged the authority of courts to rule on the issue, saying the president's power to enforce the ban should not be questioned.\n\n\"I'm a judge now. I take that seriously. And you better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed,\" Gorsuch said.\n\n\"That's the rule of law in this country,\" Gorsuch added.\n\nGorsuch declined to say how he would approach an alleged violation of the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prevents American officials from accepting any gifts or favors from foreign governments without congressional approval.\n\n\"The question is: What exactly does that mean?\" Gorsuch said, noting there was ongoing litigation on the matter. \"I have to be very careful about expressing any views.\"\n\nTrump has been sued by ethics lawyers, who say his businesses have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the Emoluments Clause.\n\nOn the basis for which an official can be impeached, Gorsuch said historically the focus had been on \"high crimes\" rather than \"misdemeanors.\" He said the number of criminal misdemeanors on the books had increased substantially since the U.S. Constitution was written in the 18th century.\n\nBOUND BY PRECEDENT\n\nA unanimous ruling on Wednesday by the Supreme Court justices whom Gorsuch would join, if confirmed, rejected legal reasoning he used as an appellate judge in a 2008 ruling against an autistic child who sought a public education more tailored to his needs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of another autistic student who argued he was denied an adequate education. Democrats have called Gorsuch's earlier decision an example of how he rules against everyday Americans while favoring corporate interests, an assertion the nominee and his Republicans supporters reject.\n\nGorsuch said he was bound by court precedent in the 2008 decision, adding it would be \"heartbreaking\" to suggest he would like ruling against disabled students.\n\nHe sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious past cases had been decided correctly, including those on abortion, gun rights, political spending and religious rights.\n\n\"What worries me is you have been very much able to avoid any specificity, like no one I have every seen before,\" Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat, told Gorsuch.\n\nFeinstein asked Gorsuch to explain a document dating from his work in former President George W. Bush's Justice Department related to 2005 anti-torture restrictions.\n\nThe document asked whether aggressive interrogation techniques used by Bush's administration had yielded valuable intelligence or stopped a terrorist incident, and Gorsuch had written \"yes.\" Gorsuch said he was merely doing what he was told by the administration. \"My recollection of 12 years ago is that was the position that the clients were telling us,\" he said.\n\nFeinstein expressed concern about women's rights and preserving legalized abortion, and asked Gorsuch about his views as an \"originalist\" seeing the Constitution's meaning as unaltered since its enactment despite centuries of societal change.\n\n\"No one is looking to return us to horse-and-buggy days,\" Gorsuch said.\n\nRegarding the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law, Gorsuch said it did not matter that some of the drafters of the language \"were racists, because they were, or sexists, because they were.\"\n\nRepublicans hold 52 seats in the 100-member Senate. The Senate has a 60-vote hurdle for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, meaning Gorsuch would need backing by eight Democrats. If Democrats stand together, Republicans could change Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority vote.\n\nA committee vote is expected on April 3. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Gorsuch would be confirmed before lawmakers' mid-April recess.\n\nIf confirmed, Gorsuch would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN16T12G"}, {"title": "U.S. conservative leader optimistic of common ground on healthcare", "text": "WASHINGTON Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives could achieve common ground on a deal to win support for healthcare legislation on Thursday, after President Donald Trump intervened in negotiations, a conservative leader said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're not there yet, but we're very optimistic that if we work around the clock between now and Noon tomorrow, that we're going to be able to hopefully find some common ground,\" Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters.\n\nMeadows' group has opposed House Republican healthcare legislation up to now and threatened earlier in the day to block its passage in a Thursday vote.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-framework-idUSKBN16T3AU"}, {"title": "Trump sends holiday greetings to Iranians, does not mention travel ban", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought to ban travelers from Iran and other Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States, issued a holiday greeting on Wednesday to Iranians celebrating the New Year holiday known as Nowruz.\n\nTrump, who has also criticized the nuclear deal between Iran and western powers negotiated during President Barack Obama's administration, did not refer to the travel ban in his statement.\n\n\"Nowruz means 'new day' in Persian.

Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs, earning $4-5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week, usually to a Tyson Foods (TSN.N) packing plant in nearby Perry, Iowa.\n\nTariffs from Mexico could depress U.S. wholesale prices and wipe out his profits, Schmidt said. \"It would be devastating.\"\n\nIN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nIn December, after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso MXN= slump, Mexico started mapping out U.S. states that are most reliant on its market, replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute, said two senior Mexican officials.\n\nMexican officials also prepared briefs, seen by Reuters, on Mexico's own risks in a dispute, including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars, such as the Ford Fusion (F.N) made in Hermosillo, Mexico.\n\nReuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around.\n\nBut the country's foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa, which raises a third of U.S. hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production, $100 million of which went to Mexico last year.\n\nThe minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin, the center of U.S. cheese production, and has singled out Texas for its \"notable\" trade surplus with Mexico. All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election, with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins.\n\nTrump has accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico. United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016.\n\nBesides pork, cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U.S. roads. Some $200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived, according to the IHS database, which the U.S. government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes. The full tariff list would apply to $3.25 billion in current U.S. exports.\n\nJohn Holevoet, the director of government affairs at Wisconsin's Dairy Business Association, said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed.\n\nWeber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration \"gets it\" when it comes to the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports. Republican Congressman Steve King, who represents Iowa's agriculture-focused fourth district, also pointed out that Iowa's role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washington's view.\n\nBut King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough.\n\nA possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trump's proposed border wall, would cause a trade war, he said.\n\nKing said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one-on-one meeting with the president. \"I'm making sure that here in Washington they know what this means.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange in Garner, Iowa and Alexandra Alper in Mexico City; Additional reporting in Mexico City by Michael O'Boyle and Christine Murray; Editing by David Chance and Tomasz Janowski)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-trade-idUSKBN16T0EZ"}, {"title": "Behind the scenes, bank lobbyists temper expectations for Dodd-Frank overhaul", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order rolling back regulations from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law on Wall Street reform at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2017.

And a friendlier SEC could act to roll back rules on industry-opposed measures like requiring companies to disclose the pay ratio between their CEO and the average employee.\n\nTo be sure, there likely will be some action this year to help banks, though it is likely to be much more limited than the Trump transition team led bankers to expect when it said one day after the November election that it would \"dismantle\" Dodd-Frank.\n\nThere appears to be bipartisan appetite for easing capital formation rules or reducing the regulations that smaller banks and credit unions must comply with.\n\nRepublicans in Congress could attack specific parts of Dodd-Frank, such as gaining control over funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - which was created to help guard individuals from fraud in mortgages, student loans and other financial products - through a budget process that would eliminate the need for Democratic support.\n\nBankers preparing on Tuesday to head to Capitol Hill to make their case heard James Ballentine, a lobbyist for the ABA, emphasize the need to stay on message with stories about the impact of regulation on their banks. He noted they would be competing with wiretapping allegations, Federal Bureau of Investigation probes, Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and a massive healthcare push all at once.\n\n\"None of those things should be topics of your conversation when you go to meet with your members of Congress,\" he cautioned the conference crowd.\n\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Linda Stern and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-lobbyists-idUSKBN16T19G"}, {"title": "Trump, Koch brothers at odds over 'Trumpcare' vote", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump (C) and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (L) enter the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 21, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nWASHINGTON Republicans considering whether or not to back U.S. President Donald Trump's healthcare reforms in a crucial House of Representatives vote this week face a painful choice.\n\nIf they vote against, they could face the wrath of a vengeful and combative president. If they vote for it, they risk retribution from the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and other powerful right-wing players whose money can be pivotal in re-election races.\n\nAs Trump faces the most formidable, high-stakes negotiation of his presidency, the fierce battle in the U.S. Congress over his plan to replace Obamacare is a test of whether Republicans will trust him with their political futures at the risk of alienating deep-pocketed conservative advocacy groups.\n\nAs Trump and leaders in the House round up support for the bill ahead of a planned Thursday vote, some groups are threatening to retaliate against those who do support it, including the Club for Growth, the Heritage Foundation's political arm, and Americans for Prosperity, which is part of the expansive political pressure network established by the Koch brothers.\n\nAll three groups are \u201ckeying\u201d the vote, which means it will be a factor in determining whether the groups deem a lawmaker to be sufficiently conservative. That opens up the possibility that some Republicans who vote in favor of the bill could face a primary challenge in next year\u2019s congressional elections and may not be able to count on help from the Kochs and others.\n\nTrump himself warned House Republicans in a meeting on Tuesday that their seats will be at risk next year if they do not support his healthcare bill, which would modify but not eliminate Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation passed in 2010.\n\n\u201cHe warned us that there are consequences if we don\u2019t come together for us as a party and also for individuals,\u201d Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina said after the meeting. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t threatening in any way. He was just giving us a pretty clear warning.\u201d\n\nTrump also told Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, an outspoken critic of the bill, that he was \"coming after\" him, according to people in the meeting. Meadows later said the president was joking.\n\n'OUTSIDER' JOINS ESTABLISHMENT\n\nSome Conservatives believe the bill does not go far enough in dismantling Obamacare and have not been satisfied by the White House\u2019s attempts to mollify them. NBC News reported on Tuesday that 26 House Republicans oppose the bill, which would leave House Speaker Paul Ryan short of the 216 votes he needs. No Democrat is expected to support the bill.\n\nThe conflict has created an odd dynamic: Trump, who ran as an \u201coutsider\u201d candidate siding with the Republican political establishment against the hard-line conservatives who were some of his most ardent supporters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has never been a favorite of libertarian conservatives such as the Kochs, or of groups such as the Club for Growth, because, among other things, he has never taken a strong stand on reining in federal spending. They opposed him during the Republican presidential campaign.\n\nFor them, the healthcare vote is a test of their continued relevance in a party seized by Trump.\n\nThe Koch network spent an estimated $250 million on last year\u2019s election. The Koch-run Americans for Prosperity, which has chapters in more than 30 states and boasts that it can deploy 3.2 million citizen activists, spent almost $14 million on the 2016 elections, according to federal records. Freedom Partners, another Koch entity which largely targeted Democrats with attack ads, spent $30 million.\n\nTim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, would not say directly that Republicans who support the bill will face consequences next year, but noted, \u201cMembers of Congress know how serious we take a vote like this.\u201d\n\nJames Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, said \u201cnetwork organizations will stand with principled lawmakers who will oppose the House healthcare proposal.\u201d\n\nDavis said the Koch network would spend between $300 million and $400 million ahead of the 2018 elections.\n\nKOCH INFLUENCE\n\nLast year, Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth targeted an incumbent House Republican, then-Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, for being too close with House leadership and not holding the line on government spending. Ellmers lost in a primary fight.\n\nHouse Republicans have been nervous about primary challenges since 2014 when Eric Cantor, then the majority leader, lost to a little-known conservative named David Brat.\n\nPhillips said his organization last year was instrumental in getting Republican incumbents Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania re-elected. The two leading Koch groups sat out then-Senator Kelly Ayotte\u2019s tight race in New Hampshire. Ayotte lost by 0.1 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cGroups such as the Kochs have been an important part of a coalition of outside Republican money,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a congressional political analyst in Washington. \u201cIf that coalition falters, that could contribute to Democratic gains.\u201d\n\nBut several lawmakers interviewed by Reuters were dismissive of the opposition by conservative groups.\n\n\u201cFor me, this healthcare bill is an absolute no-brainer,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes of California, a close Trump ally. \u201cAny conservative group who opposes it, I don\u2019t even understand how they can categorize themselves as being a conservative group.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s supporters have argued that voters are more likely to punish Republicans who do not act to replace Obamacare when given the chance. \u201cIf it fails there are going to be a lot of people who are looking for work in 2018,\u201d said Representative Mike Conaway of Texas.\n\nThe political implications of the bill, though, remain largely unclear.\n\nEven if it passes the House, the bill faces a difficult path in the Senate, where several conservatives have declared their opposition. Veteran House members recall in 2009, when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi forced a vote on a bill that would cap carbon emissions. The bill did not pass the Senate, and many Democrats from coal states lost their seats in the 2010 elections for their votes.\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwall and Steve Holland; Editing by Jason Szep and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-kochs-idUSKBN16T07D"}, {"title": "Fannie, Freddie revamp plan unlikely this year, dividends in focus", "text": "The headquarters of mortgage lender Freddie Mac is seen in Mclean, Virginia, near Washington, in this September 8, 2008 file photo. REUTERS/Jason Reed/Files\n\nWASHINGTON An overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is highly unlikely to make it into this year's legislative calendar, Congressional staffers say, possibly shifting the new administration's immediate focus to allowing the mortgage financing institutions' to rebuild depleted capital.\n\nFannie and Freddie stocks soared late last year when President Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the companies that have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis should be privatized.\n\nHedge funds and other investors have been lobbying for the removal of government controls over the mortgage giants' profits, which since 2012 have been transferred to the Treasury, and their eventual privatization.\n\nThe shares dipped when Mnuchin seemed to backpedal on the privatization pledge during his January confirmation hearing and suffered another setback last month when a court rejected investors' suit against the dividend transfers.\n\nCongressional staffers say the Senate Banking Committee has begun weekly bipartisan staff briefings on Freddie and Fannie reforms, but it is starting from scratch. The House Financial Services Committee is focused on other legislation, such as renewing the flood insurance program and rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform, pushing the mortgage giants' revamp down the to-do list, they say.\n\nInstead, investors' focus is shifting to how Mnuchin and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt, an Obama Administration holdover, will manage the dividends transfers.\n\nAnalysts expect the two institutions to make a full $10 billion dividend payment for the fourth quarter on March 31. But investors will be looking for any indication from Watt or Mnuchin about whether they plan to allow the mortgage firms to retain profits later on and begin the slow recapitalization process.\n\nThough rebuilding an adequate capital buffer would take years - as long as two to three presidential administrations, according to one analyst - it would eventually allow Fannie and Freddie to leave government conservatorship, returning value to their investors.\n\nWatt has warned the mortgage giants have a dangerously thin capital buffer. Mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing he favored finding a \"bipartisan fix.\"\n\nThe two will likely wait for congressional inaction to become a de facto impasse before letting Freddie and Fannie hold on to their profits, analysts said, estimating a decision could be made two or three quarters out.\n\n\u201cMnuchin has been out there talking about a bipartisan agreement,\u201d Heights Securities analyst Edwin Groshans told Reuters. \u201cThat process will have to play out until it in essence fails. When that process fails, that would open the opportunity for Mnuchin and Watts to act.\u201d\n\nTim Pagliara, an investor who founded Investors Unite, a coalition of more than 1,000 Fannie and Freddie investors, told Reuters he did not expect an imminent legislative fix and called the situation in Congress \"fluid.\"\n\n\u201cThe focus is going to continue to be on the court cases and what the administration is going to do \u2013 and what they\u2019ve said they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Pagliara added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration generally supports transferring government programs to the private sector. Trump donor John Paulson runs three hedge funds in which the president has invested and which held stakes in the mortgage institutions. Mnuchin, under the terms of a government ethics agreement, divested between $1 million and $2 million he had in Paulson's funds.\n\nFannie and Freddie provide stability to the U.S. housing market by buying mortgages and bundling them into government-backed securities. During the financial crisis, they received $187 billion in government aid and by now have repaid $265 billion via dividend payments to the Treasury.\n\nFHFA\u2019s Watt has warned the payments have depleted the companies' capital buffer and that by January 2018 they will have \u201cno ability to weather quarterly losses.\u201d\n\nFannie was required by law to keep a minimum capital reserve of about $33 billion and Freddie $29 billion headed into the 2008 bailout, which suspended those requirements.\n\nIndustry analysts, shareholders and advocacy groups - both conservative and liberal - all believe that the same 2008 bailout law gives Watt the authority to allow the companies to begin rebuilding capital, without waiting for Congress.\n\n(Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Linda Stern and Tomasz Janowski)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-housing-finance-idUSKBN16T11J"}, {"title": "Trump tries to rally support for healthcare bill", "text": "Demonstrators protest over the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, outside the offices of Republican congressman Darryl Issa, in Vista, California, U.S., March 21, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump tried to rally Republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle Obamacare on Tuesday as U.S. stock markets showed their worst one-day performance since the November election.\n\nTrump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months.\n\nIn one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face \"political problems\" for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns.\n\n\"The president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. \"We made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we don't keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trump's election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June.\n\n\u201cYou have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can\u2019t pass, then they can\u2019t move on to taxes. There\u2019s this feeling that if things don\u2019t get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up,\" said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)\n\nParty leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it.\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report.\n\nRepublican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face \"political problems.\" Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats.\n\nELECTORAL RISKS\n\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trump's main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.\n\nWhile Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.\n\nNancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalo's Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot.\n\n\"It is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election,\" Nielsen said.\n\nDemocrats oppose the Republicans' plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.\n\nRepublican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.\n\nRepublican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacare's taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018.\n\nThe amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the country's largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.\n\nCongressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did \"more listening than directing.\" There was some \"political talk\" but \"no threats,\" he said.\n\nDonovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.\n\nThe Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill.\n\nThe Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the House approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the Senate floor next week.\n\n(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson, Jeff Mason, Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey, Richard Cowan and David Morgan; Writing by Alistair Bell and Amanda Becker; Editing by Frances Kerry, Jonathan Oatis and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16R2P9"}, {"title": "Trump to attend NATO summit in Brussels May 25", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner in Washington, U.S., March 21, 2017.

It's time to get busy, get to work and get the job done,\" Trump said.\n\nThe event raised a record $30 million for the committees that help pay for Senate and House election campaigns, more than the $20 million brought in at the same event a year ago.\n\nTrump made reference to a controversy that he has been embroiled in: his efforts to suspend temporarily people traveling from several Muslim-majority nations.\n\nHis original Jan. 27 executive order applying to people from seven countries was blocked by federal judges.

(GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2mB9WPR)\n\n\"When I became a judge, they gave me a gavel not a rubber stamp,\" Gorsuch said. \"I am my own man,\" he added.\n\nTrump has assailed the judiciary both as a candidate and since taking office on Jan. 20. He condemned federal judges who put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the United States of people from several Muslim-majority countries, calling one a \"so-called judge\" and suggesting that blame for a future terrorist attack should go to the courts.\n\n\"When anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or the motives of a federal judge, well I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth,\" Gorsuch said.\n\nWhen Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked if that included Trump, Gorsuch said, \"Anyone is anyone.\" Gorsuch previously made similar remarks in private to senators including Blumenthal, but Trump at the time accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuch's comments.\n\nTrump indicated in a speech on Tuesday night that his approach was unlikely to change.\n\n\"The courts are not helping us, to be honest, it\u2019s ridiculous.

Asked by Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president has the power to violate a law on surveillance of Americans, Gorsuch said, \"Nobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the president of the United States.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump resumes the use of waterboarding, a prohibited form of simulated drowning, on detainees, he \"may get impeached.\" Gorsuch said he would not speculate on whether Trump could be prosecuted if he authorized waterboarding, but repeated, \"No man is above the law.\"\n\nRepublicans have praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. Democrats, who have slim chances of blocking his nomination, have questioned his suitability, with some portraying him as favoring corporate interests and insufficiently independent from Trump.\n\nChuck Grassley, the panel's Republican chairman, asked Gorsuch \"whether you'd have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you.\"\n\n\"That's a softball, Mr. Chairman,\" Gorsuch said. \"I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require. And I'm heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there's no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge.

Department of Labor, 2016\n\n(bit.ly/2aUK2Ub)\n\nThis case shows, liberals say, that Gorsuch rules for employers at the expense of workers. In it, he dissented from a three-judge panel that ruled in favor of truck driver Alphonse Maddin. He was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at roadside after its brakes froze. The panel ruled he was wrongly terminated. Gorsuch disagreed.\n\n'Chevron deference'\n\nGutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch (2016)\n\n(bit.ly/2bLfVgE)\n\nIn an immigration case, Gorsuch criticized the \"Chevron deference\" legal doctrine that says courts should defer to federal agencies on interpreting the law. Gorsuch said it concentrates federal power \"in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.\" If the court were to roll back the doctrine, presidents would have less leeway to interpret the law when issuing regulations through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n'Class clown'\n\nA.M. v Holmes, 2016\n\n(bit.ly/29VN4Jy)\n\nRepublicans say Gorsuch does not put politics above the law and follows his own path. In some criminal cases, he has come down hard on prosecutors or government officials, while also sometimes defying colleagues on the bench. In this case, he decried the handcuffing and arrest of a seventh-grade \"class clown\" in Albuquerque who refused to stop burping in class, saying the police officer involved should not have gotten immunity from suit. Paraphrasing Charles Dickens, he said the law is not as much of an \"ass\" as to allow for that.\n\n'No trespassing'\n\nU.S. v Carloss 2016\n\n(bit.ly/2nLGzw3)\n\nStanding up for homeowners' property rights, Gorsuch dissented from a decision to admit evidence discovered by police officers who approached, and later entered, a home despite several \u201cNo trespassing\u201d signs outside. He lampooned the idea that the government can knock on anyone\u2019s door, at any time, saying homeowners might be surprised to learn that \u201cNo trespassing signs have become little more than lawn art.\u201d\n\nTransgender rights\n\nDruley v Patton (2015)\n\n(bit.ly/2ntFcEV)\n\nIn a ruling highlighted by liberal activists as a sign he may be hostile to gay and transgender rights, Gorsuch joined a ruling against a transgender Oklahoma state prisoner who claimed prison officials violated her rights by denying her adequate hormone therapy and housing her with men. The court rejected her claims, saying she had not proved she would be \u201cirreparably harmed without her requested hormone treatment.\u201d\n\nEmployee rights\n\nHwang v. Kansas State University, 2014\n\n(bit.ly/SsXD8J)\n\nIn a case criticized by liberals, Gorsuch wrote the opinion when a three-judge panel ruled against Kansas State University professor Grace Hwang. She got six months of sick leave from the school when she was diagnosed with cancer. When she asked for more time, Kansas State refused. Hwang alleged illegal disability discrimination. Gorsuch said Hwang was a capable teacher and was legally disabled. But he wrote: \"There\u2019s also no question she wasn\u2019t able to perform the essential functions of her job even with a reasonable accommodation.\u201d He said the law was not intended to \u201cturn employers into safety net providers for those who cannot work.\u201d Hwang has since died.\n\nReligious freedom\n\nHobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 2013\n\n(bit.ly/2func5k)\n\nLiberals say this case shows Gorsuch sides with corporations over people and favors religious liberty over other interests, including womens' contraceptive rights. Retailer Hobby Lobby argued it should not have to provide insurance coverage for female employees' birth control, defying a rule by the administration of former President Barack Obama. Gorsuch concurred in an opinion favoring the company and expressed sympathy for evangelical Christian business owners. The Supreme Court later upheld the decision for the company.\n\n(Compiled by Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-cases-factbox-idUSKBN16S10X"}, {"title": "Exclusive: Tillerson urges Senate ratification of Montenegro's NATO membership", "text": "FILE PHOTO - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks on issues related to visas and travel after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new travel ban order in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2017.

By early this month, it had been approved by 24. NATO members see Montenegro's accession as a way to counter Russia's efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans.\n\nObjections from at least two Republican senators, Rand Paul and Mike Lee, have blocked a quick vote in the full U.S. Senate for months and Senate leaders have not scheduled a more time-consuming roll-call vote.\n\nPaul has questioned the wisdom of angering Russia and taking on the potential expense of approving NATO membership for a tiny country that could not play a significant role in defending the United States.\n\nIn his letter to the Senate's Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and copied to Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, Tillerson said it would be \"immeasurably helpful\" if the Senate scheduled a floor vote to complete ratification procedures in time for Trump's participation in the May NATO summit.\n\n\"Montenegro's participation in the May NATO Summit as full member, not as an observer, will send a strong signal of transatlantic unity,\" Tillerson added.\n\n\"It is strongly in the interests of the United States that Montenegro's membership in NATO be ratified,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesman for McConnell said on Monday that no vote had yet been scheduled.\n\nMontenegro's NATO membership has already been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Paul and Senator John McCain, one of the leading Russia hawks in the U.S. Congress, had a heated exchange about the issue in the Senate last week.\n\nMcCain said Paul was working for Russian President Vladimir Putin by blocking a quick vote on Montenegro.

The U.S. government should have publicized the existence of a program that vacuumed up in bulk Americans' telephone call data before its existence was leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency's deputy director said on Tuesday.\n\nRichard Ledgett, who is retiring next month, said in an interview with Reuters that disclosing the secret program would have been difficult. But, he said, doing so might have mitigated the damage done by Snowden.\n\n\"That's one where I might have to say, yes,\" Ledgett said in his office at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. \"That's one where maybe it would have been less shocking when Snowden did what he did.\"\n\nLedgett's comments, which echo the sentiments of some former top U.S. officials, come as the U.S. intelligence community is stepping up efforts to convince Congress to reauthorize other controversial surveillance programs.\n\nThose programs allow intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreigners living overseas, but incidentally scoops up the communications of an unknown number of Americans.\n\nThe programs, authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress takes action.\n\nLedgett said that the NSA, whose mission is to intercept adversaries' communications while protecting sensitive U.S. government networks, had learned from the Snowden experience.\n\n\"We\u2019re being very open about the (Section 702) program, and will be,\" he said.\n\nPrivacy advocates have repeatedly demanded that the government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under Section 702.\n\nIntelligence officials have declined to do so. But Ledgett, in remarks earlier Tuesday at a forum sponsored by the Aspen Institute, said \"yes\" when asked if an estimate would be provided before year end.\n\nSnowden's revelation of the bulk telephone data program - which captured information about calls such as the numbers and time stamp, but not their actual content - prompted congressional hearings and court battles.\n\nIn 2015, Congress passed a law replacing it with a more limited system while installing new transparency measures over U.S. surveillance activity.\n\nU.S. officials argued that the program was lawful, and aimed at finding violent militants or other adversaries in communication with allies inside the United States.\n\nIn the 50-minute interview at the NSA's large campus outside Washington, Ledgett expressed concern about the vulnerability of U.S. critical infrastructure to cyber attack by another nation.\n\n\"All of the major cyber threat actors that we worry about have efforts in place, have that capability,\" he said.\n\n\"Can you take out a traffic system? Absolutely. Can you take out comm(unication)s systems? Absolutely. Can you take out gas and oil distribution, and energy distribution systems? Absolutely you can. ... We're more vulnerable than most.\"\n\nHe also gave a small insight into the secret cyber battles playing out globally, around-the-clock.\n\nIn late 2015, he said, an unclassified U.S. government computer network was penetrated by another nation, and the NSA was called in to help.\n\nIn the past, when an adversary realized they had been discovered, they would withdraw. \"Like a turtle, touch them and they pull in their shell,\" Ledgett said.\n\n\"What happened here was, they fought back. So it kind of became a hand-to-hand combat thing,\" he said. \"We\u2019d remove their malware. They would deploy new malware, even though they knew we were in the system.

U.S. officials also said Tillerson would visit Russia later in April.\n\nThe alliance had offered to change the meeting dates so Tillerson could attend both it and the Xi talks but the U.S. State Department rebuffed the idea, a former U.S. official and a former NATO diplomat, both speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the department put forward new dates for a meeting when Tillerson could come, noting that such a decision would have to be made by consensus among the 28 NATO members.\n\n\"We are certainly appreciative of the effort to accommodate Secretary Tillerson,\" Toner told reporters. \"We have offered alternative dates that the secretary could attend.\"\n\nHe also sought to allay European concerns by saying that \"the United States remains 100 percent committed to NATO.\"\n\nIt was not yet clear if the NATO meeting would be rescheduled to accommodate Tillerson.\n\nDuring his election campaign and on the eve of taking office in January, Trump called the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation \"obsolete,\" although he has since said he strongly supports the alliance.\n\n'UNFORTUNATE SYMBOLISM'\n\n\"No matter how you spin it, this is unfortunate symbolism,\" said one senior European diplomat of Tillerson's plan to skip the April 5-6 NATO Brussels meeting, saying it undid the work of Trump's vice president and defense minister, who visited NATO headquarters in February to provide reassurances after Trump's criticism of the alliance.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was in Washington on Tuesday. Posing for photographs with Defense Secretary James Mattis, he declined to answer a reporter's questions on what signal it sent that Tillerson did not plan to attend the meeting, according to a reporter who attended the session.\n\nSome allies, particularly in the former Soviet bloc, are acutely sensitive to any sign of waning U.S. interest in their defense as they deal with a more assertive Russia.\n\nConcerns that Trump is too close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the West has sought to isolate for annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, made Tillerson's expected visit to Brussels all the more pressing, European allies said.\n\nTillerson worked with Russia's government for years as a top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp, and has questioned sanctions against Moscow that he said could harm U.S. businesses.\n\n\"We needed to hear his vision for the alliance,\" said a diplomat due to attend the April ministerial meeting.\n\nNATO's quarterly meetings are closed-door sessions over about two days in which governments discuss security strategies and approve top secret documents designed to guide the nuclear-armed alliance in areas ranging from training in Afghanistan to defenses against Iranian missiles.\n\nGiven the U.S. role as the de facto head of the alliance, it is rare for the country's top diplomat to miss a NATO meeting. The last time was during the Iraq war in 2003, when Colin Powell was forced to cancel at the last moment.\n\nTrump himself is expected in Brussels for a NATO summit in May, although the date is still under discussion. NATO has proposed holding that meeting on May 25, a NATO diplomat said.\n\nSeveral diplomats said they were unhappy that Tillerson had not offered to hold a NATO meeting in Washington later this week, given that most alliance foreign ministers and Stoltenberg will be there for a meeting of an international coalition against the Islamic State militant group.\n\nA State Department spokeswoman said on Monday night that all NATO members except Croatia would be at those talks. On Tuesday, Toner said Croatia would in fact attend, saying the department had made \"a late night gaffe\" and adding, \"in no way do we want to diminish Croatia's valuable role within the alliance.\"\n\n(Reporting by Robin Emmott and Arshad Mohammed; Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris; Editing by Gareth Jones and Frances Kerry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tillerson-nato-idUSKBN16S18S"}, {"title": "Trump administration not considering a carbon tax: White House official", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump takes the stage for a rally at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. March 20, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump tried to rally Republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle Obamacare on Tuesday as U.S. stock markets showed their worst one-day performance since the November election.\n\nTrump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months.\n\nIn one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face \"political problems\" for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns.\n\n\"The president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. \"We made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we don't keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trump's election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June.\n\n\u201cYou have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can\u2019t pass, then they can\u2019t move on to taxes. There\u2019s this feeling that if things don\u2019t get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up,\" said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)\n\nParty leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it.\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report.\n\nRepublican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face \"political problems.\" Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats.\n\nELECTORAL RISKS\n\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trump's main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.\n\nWhile Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.\n\nNancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalo's Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot.\n\n\"It is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election,\" Nielsen said.\n\nDemocrats oppose the Republicans' plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.\n\nRepublican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.\n\nRepublican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacare's taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018.\n\nThe amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the country's largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.\n\nCongressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did \"more listening than directing.\" There was some \"political talk\" but \"no threats,\" he said.\n\nDonovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.\n\nThe Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill.\n\nThe Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the House approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the Senate floor next week.\n\n(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson, Jeff Mason, Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey, Richard Cowan and David Morgan; Writing by Alistair Bell and Amanda Becker; Editing by Frances Kerry, Jonathan Oatis and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16S1JL"}, {"title": "Ex-U.S. Attorney Bharara, fired by Trump, joins NYU law school", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York City, U.S., July 13, 2016.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON FBI Director James Comey on Monday confirmed for the first time that the bureau is investigating possible ties between Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nComey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, made clear that their investigation of Moscow and November's U.S. elections could last for months.\n\nAppearing before a congressional panel, Comey also publicly challenged Trump's claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his 2016 campaign headquarters in Manhattan's Trump Tower.\n\nThe two officials spent 5-1/2 hours before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee in testimony marked by starkly partisan divides between the panel's majority Republicans and Democrats.\n\nComey refused to back away from his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not simply want Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to lose the election; he wanted Donald Trump to win.\n\nTrump created a controversy in early March when he tweeted without giving evidence that Obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against Clinton.\n\n\"With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets,\" Comey said.\n\nLeon Panetta, a former U.S. defense secretary and CIA director during the Obama administration, said in an interview that Trump should \"acknowledge that he made a mistake, apologize to President Obama.\"\n\nThe committee is one of several in the U.S. Congress investigating whether Russia tried to influence the election, mostly by hacking Democratic operatives' emails and releasing embarrassing information. Russia denies the allegations.\n\nComey confirmed the FBI has been investigating since July possible Russian efforts to interfere in the election, including any cooperation between Trump's campaign and Moscow. He said that while the Russian government wanted to hurt Clinton's campaign and help Trump's, intelligence agencies made no judgment on whether the efforts influenced the outcome.\n\nComey gave no details of the classified investigation and said the fact that it exists does not mean charges would be filed.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump by hacking leading Democrats.\n\nPUTIN'S PREFERENCE\n\n\"I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the (intelligence) community,\" he said. \"Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.\"\n\nAsked about Comey, White House spokesman Sean Spicer read a series of quotes from officials - some from the Obama administration - who have said they have seen no signs of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.\n\nIn a tweet before the hearing, Trump wrote: \"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a\n\nterrible campaign.\"\n\nSpicer said he was unaware of any White House official being under investigation by the FBI.\n\nTrump has frequently urged better relations with Russia, which has been at odds with the United States over Ukraine and the Syrian civil war.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, detailed activities by Trump associates with ties to Russia, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who was forced out as Trump's national security adviser after talking to the Russian ambassador and then misrepresenting the conversation to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible,\" Schiff said. \"But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated.\"\n\nNO 'PHYSICAL' WIRETAP\n\nTrump's March 4 tweet about wiretapping pulled attention away from the claims of Russian election interference. He issued his tweet two days after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who met with Russia's U.S. ambassador at least twice last year, said he would recuse himself from any investigation of the matter.\n\nThe White House has contended in recent days that Trump's claim of wiretapping referred to general surveillance of the campaign. The White House has not provided evidence of surveillance of any kind.\n\n\"Let me be clear: We know there was not a physical wiretap on Trump Tower. However, it's still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates,\" said Representative Devin Nunes, the committee's Republican chairman.\n\nLast week, Trump's spokesman cited a media report that British intelligence was behind the surveillance, prompting ridicule in London.\n\nRogers said the allegation had strained relations with London. \"I think it clearly frustrates a key ally of ours,\" Rogers said.\n\nComey warned that Russia would attempt to influence the next U.S. presidential election in 2020 and perhaps congressional elections next year.\n\n\"They'll be back in 2020.

Committing troops is one thing, while fighting terrorism is another thing.\"\n\nAbadi, who leads the Shi'ite majority government in Baghdad, said it would be crucial to win over the local population in Sunni-dominated Mosul to achieve lasting peace.\n\nA White House statement about the meeting said both Trump and Abadi agreed that \"terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone,\" and the two leaders called for deepening commercial ties, including in the energy sector.\n\nAt the forum, Abadi called for more financial contributions from the international community.\n\n\"We (would) love to see more funds so that we can quickly (regain) prosperity and stabilization in these areas,\" he said.\n\nTOUGH JOB\n\nAbadi spoke as Iraqi forces made steady progress in seizing back Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, from Islamic State, which officials expect will become a more classic insurgency once it loses its last major strongholds.\n\nIn a sign of the threat, a car bomb killed at least 23 people and wounded more than 45 in a mainly Shi'ite southern district, police and medical sources said.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility, but Islamic State has carried out similar attacks in Baghdad and other cities as its hold on Mosul weakens.\n\nEarlier in the day, as the two men met, Trump told Abadi that he knew his forces were fighting hard.\n\n\"It's not an easy job,\" Trump said. \"It's a very tough job. Your soldiers are fighting hard. I know Mosul is moving along. ... We will figure something out.\n\n\"Our main thrust is we have to get rid of ISIS. We're going to get rid of ISIS. It will happen. It's happening right now,\" Trump added, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nAsked whether he had seen the Trump administration's plan to wipe out Islamic State, Abadi said: \"I haven't seen a full plan. I know there is a plan. I haven't seen it.\"\n\nAbadi is in Washington this week ahead of a gathering of world leaders of a coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nIn many ways, his visit comes at a high point for him after successfully appealing to Trump to remove Iraq from a list of countries included in a revamped travel ban.\n\nTrump decided this month's revised order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from several Muslim-majority nations would not include Iraq because of its cooperation with the United States. Both the initial Jan. 27 travel ban and the revised version have been blocked by federal courts.\n\nDetractors argue the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON Some Republican lawmakers appear to be reassessing whether to make changes to a surveillance law that allows broad snooping of Internet communications, citing concerns over the handling of classified intercepts after leaks of conversations between Russian officials and American associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of communications from foreigners, but often incidentally scoops up the communications of Americans.\n\nUntil recently most Republicans have been quick to defend Section 702 and Congress had been expected to renew it without major changes before it expires at the end of the year.\n\nThough long criticized by privacy advocates, a new front of potential opposition to Section 702 has emerged as Republicans sputter about what they view as politically motivated leaks by the agencies amid probes of any collusion between the Russian government and Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.\n\nThe tensions burst into full view on Monday at a U.S. House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee hearing, during which FBI Director James Comey confirmed his agency was investigating those ties.\n\nRepublican Representative Tom Rooney told Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, who also testified, that concern over leaks would undermine support for Section 702, even though it appears to not have led directly to the leaks Republicans are fuming over.\n\n\"When we try to retain this tool this year and try to convince some of our colleagues that this is really important for national security and somebody in the intelligence community says, 'You know what, the hell with it, I'm going to release this person\u2019s name because I'm going to get something out of it,' we're all going to be hurt by that,\" Rooney said as he removed his glasses in apparent exasperation.\n\nWhile Democrats on the committee focused their questioning of Comey and Rogers on whether Trump aides may have suspicious ties to Russian officials, Republicans repeatedly redirected the conversation to focus on whether enough safeguards were in place to prevent leaks about Americans.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies accused Moscow of attempts to influence the election in favor of Republican Trump, in part by hacking emails of Democratic Party operatives. Russia denies the allegations. Trump has criticized the intelligence agencies and has denied he has had anything to do with Russia.\n\nSection 702 surveillance is intended to apply only to foreigners living overseas. Elaborate rules govern incidental coverage of Americans, but the information can sometimes be used nonetheless. Privacy advocates have said that communications belonging to as many as tens of millions of Americans could be caught up in the searches.\n\nDespite the concern about leaks, a White House official told Reuters earlier this month that the Trump administration favored a reauthorization this year of the expiring portions of the FISA without any changes to address privacy concerns.\n\nOn Monday, several Republicans sought to directly link media reports revealing that Trump's former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, exchanged calls during the presidential transition with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about sanctions to the debate about Section 702.\n\nFlynn had told Vice President Mike Pence he did not speak to Kislyak about sanctions, an assertion contradicted by news articles, which cited transcripts of surveillance intercepts and led to Flynn's ouster.\n\nComey and Rogers both said that Section 702 surveillance was unrelated to how intercepts of Flynn's calls were collected or leaked to the press, and that such information would have most likely been gathered under a different part of FISA or a wholly separate authority.\n\n\"That is a distinction that doesn't make a difference to people watching on television,\" Representative Trey Gowdy responded, adding that renewal of Section 702 was \"in jeopardy if we don't get this resolved.\"\n\nThe hearing echoed conversations that took place during a closed meeting with senior intelligence officials this month with the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to take the lead on writing legislation that will seek reform and renewal of Section 702.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the meeting said several lawmakers sought clarity on how many intelligence officials had access to classified surveillance information but were frustrated by the lack of clear answers.\n\nRogers said Monday that 20 people at NSA, including himself, possessed the authority to \"unmask\" Americans whose communications are ensnared via foreign intelligence programs. A select few officials at other agencies also have the authority, including some at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the CIA.\n\nSection 702 enables sweeping surveillance programs known as Prism and Upstream, which were revealed publicly in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nPrism gathers messaging data from Alphabet Inc's Google , Facebook Inc , Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Upstream allows the NSA to copy Web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the United States and search that data.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-surveillance-idUSKBN16R2O1"}, {"title": "Iraq's PM, on U.S. visit, says wins assurances from Trump administration", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump greets Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2017.

REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan\n\nWASHINGTON Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as Trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him, while Democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations.\n\nWith the ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado. Republicans praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice.\n\n\"I think we're off to a good start,\" Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee's chairman, said afterward, with senators getting their first shot at questioning Gorsuch on Tuesday.\n\nCommittee Democrats noted Gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats raised questions about Gorsuch's suitability for the job.\n\n\"Our job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable, mainstream conservative or is he not,\" said the panel's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since Trump nominated him on Jan. 31, Gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of Democratic criticism of his rulings.\n\nGorsuch, speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble, emphasized the need for \"neutral and independent judges to apply the law,\" warned against judicial overreach, and referred to \"the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy.\"\n\n\"If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk,\" Gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected \"activist judges.\"\n\nGorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable jurist, gave Democrats very little ammunition to use against him, although there could be more drama when he takes questions. The hearing could last four days, providing classic Washington political theater.\n\nGrassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on April 3, with the full Senate vote likely soon after.\n\nIf Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when Trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders, put on hold by courts, to block people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.\n\nBlumenthal said it was not \"idle speculation\" to suggest the Supreme Court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against Trump, citing FBI Director James Comey's testimony before Congress on Monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nRepublican Ted Cruz said there is no reason for Gorsuch to be questioned about Trump, noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them.\n\nDemocrats highlighted cases on which Gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising Trump on his selection.\n\nFeinstein emphasized abortion. Conservatives have long opposed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights \"super precedents\" deserving special deference.\n\nFeinstein cited two Gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he \"argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy said he was worried that Gorsuch\u2019s conservative method of interpreting the Constitution \"goes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda\" that is anti-abortion, anti-environment and pro-business.\n\n\"Will you allow the government to intrude on Americans' personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?\" Leahy said.\n\nMany Democrats contend Trump's party \"stole\" a Supreme Court seat by freezing out Garland.\n\n\"Your nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government,\" Senator Dick Durbin told Gorsuch. \"That is why the Senate Republicans kept this Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office.\"\n\nGorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect.\n\n\"I have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in Colorado,\" he said. He also said he has ruled for disabled students, prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations, and for immigrants who entered the country illegally.\n\nThe court's ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more.\n\nRepublicans hold 52 of the Senate's 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. If Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-gorsuch-idUSKBN16Q0BP"}, {"title": "NY attorney general hires former federal prosecutor as he pursues Trump", "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has been looking into investments of U.S. President Donald Trump and other matters related to the Trump administration, on Monday said he has hired two lawyers with federal government experience.\n\nIn a memo to his staff on Monday, Schneiderman said he had hired former federal prosecutor Howard Master as senior enforcement counsel.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to build dozens of new warships in one of the biggest peace-time expansions of the U.S. Navy. But interviews with ship-builders, unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan.\n\nThe initiative could cost nearly $700 billion in government funding, take 30 years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers - many of whom don't exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained, according to the interviews and the documents reviewed.\n\nTrump has vowed a huge build-up of the U.S. military to project American power in the face of an emboldened China and Russia. That includes expanding the Navy to 350 warships from 275 today. He has provided no specifics, including how soon he wants the larger fleet. (For graphics on projected strength of U.S. Navy, shipyard employment see: tmsnrt.rs/2n3vOr0)\n\nThe Navy has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a report that explores how the country's industrial base could support higher ship production, Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of Naval Operations with oversight of the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding outlook, told Reuters.\n\nHe declined to give further details. But those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues - there are not enough skilled workers in the market, from electricians to welders, and after years of historically low production, shipyards and their suppliers, including nuclear fuel producers, will struggle to ramp up for years.\n\nTo be sure, the first, and biggest, hurdle for Trump to overcome is to persuade a cost-conscious Congress to fund the military buildup.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. A Navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require \u201csufficient time\u201d to allow companies to ramp up capacity.\n\nThe two largest U.S. shipbuilders, General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N), told Reuters they are planning to hire a total of 6,000 workers in 2017 just to meet current orders, such as the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine.\n\nGeneral Dynamics hopes to hire 2,000 workers at Electric Boat this year. Currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than 15,000 workers, to nearly 20,000 by the early 2030s, company documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nHuntington Ingalls, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, plans to hire 3,000 at its Newport News shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, and another 1,000 at the Ingalls shipyard in Mississippi this year to fulfill current orders, spokeswoman Beci Brenton said.\n\nCompanies say they are eager to work with Trump to build his bigger Navy. But expanding hiring, for now, is difficult to do until they receive new orders, officials say.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to look beyond\" current orders, Brenton said.\n\nSmaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious.\n\n\"You can\u2019t hire people to do nothing,\" said Jill Mackie, spokeswoman for Portland, Oregon-based Vigor Industrial LLC, which makes combat craft for the Navy\u2019s Special Warfare units. \"Until funding is there ... you can\u2019t bring on more workers.\"\n\nSCALING UP WORKFORCE\n\nBecause companies won't hire excess workers in advance, they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes, said Bryan Clark, who led strategic planning for the Navy as special assistant to the chief of Naval Operations until 2013.\n\nUnion and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging. Demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as $300,000 per year, including overtime and benefits, said Danny Hendrix, the business manager at Pipeliners Local 798, a union representing 6,500 metal workers in 42 states.\n\nMuch of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many can\u2019t get, said Jimmy Hart, president of the Metal Trades Department at the AFL-CIO union, which represents 100,000 boilermakers, machinists, and pipefitters, among others.\n\nTo help grow a larger labor force from the ground up, General Dynamics' Electric Boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in Connecticut and Rhode Island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers.\n\n\u201cIt has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding,\" said Maura Dunn, vice president of human resources at Electric Boat.\n\nIt can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds, radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclear-powered submarine, said Will Lennon, vice president of the shipyard's Columbia Class submarine program.\n\nThe Navy envisioned by Trump could create more than 50,000 jobs, the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade group representing U.S. shipbuilders, repairers and suppliers, told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly 100,000 in 2016, Labor Department statistics show. The industry had as many as 176,000 workers at the height of the Cold War in the early 1980s as the United States built up a fleet of nearly 600 warships by the end of that decade.\n\nSUBMARINE CRUNCH\n\nApart from the labor shortage, there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the Navy, especially its submarine fleet.\n\nExpanding the Navy to 350 ships is not as simple as just adding 75 ships. Many ships in the current 275-vessel fleet need to be replaced, which means the Navy would have to buy 321 ships between now and 2046 to reach Trump's goal, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report in February.\n\nThe shipyards that make nuclear submarines - General Dynamics' Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, and Huntington's Newport News - produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early 1980s. But for more than a decade now, the yards have not built more than two per year.\n\nThe nuclear-powered Virginia class and Columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build. The first Columbia submarine, which is set to begin construction in 2021, will take seven years to build, and two to three additional years to test.\n\nRetooling the long-dormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments, but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain, said Clark, the former strategist for the Navy and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.\n\nMakers of submarine components such as reactor cores, big castings, and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production, said a congressional official with knowledge of the Navy\u2019s long-term planning.\n\n\"We have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year. You can\u2019t then just throw one or two more on top of that and say, 'Oh here, dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two.' You just can't,\" the official said.\n\nIn his first budget proposal to Congress on Thursday, Trump proposed boosting defense spending by $54 billion for the fiscal 2018 year \u2013 a 10 percent increase from last year. He is also seeking $30 billion for the Defense Department in a supplemental budget for fiscal 2017, of which at least $433 million is earmarked for military shipbuilding.\n\nA 350-ship Navy would cost $690 billion over the 30-year period, or $23 billion per year - 60 percent more than the average funding the Navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades, the Congressional Budget Office said.\n\nSenator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will have a major say in approving the defense budget, said in a statement to Reuters that he supported Trump's vision to increase the size of the Navy to deter adversaries.\n\n\"However, this is not a blank check,\" he said.\n\nInfographic ID: '2mPPooE'\n\n(Click here for a graphic on 'Fleet expansion' here)\n\n(Additional reporting by Luciana Lopez in New York, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Ross Colvin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-shipbuilding-insight-idUSKBN16O142"}, {"title": "The Trump presidency on March 20 at 1:55 P.M.

UPR's budget has already been slashed by $348 million over the last three fiscal years, according to Rossello's letter.\n\nIts troubles are entangled with broad economic distress in the U.S. territory, where almost half the population lives in poverty and unemployment is more than twice the U.S. average.

That stands in contrast to the approach of liberal environmentalists under former President Barack Obama, who backed bans on certain kinds of oil drilling and regulations aimed at discouraging petroleum use.\n\nBut whatever their differences, the conservative groups say they have an important role to play.\n\n\"Conservatives now have a chance to earn back the trust of Americans on environmental issues,\" said Alex Bozmoski, director of strategy for republicEn. \"They can lead in a completely different direction that actually grows the economy while cutting greenhouse gasses.\"\n\nThe activists' efforts have not swayed anywhere near a majority yet on Capitol Hill. Only 20 or so of the 237 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have spoken out on climate change this year. But they hope to build a big enough bloc in Congress, or enough influence at the White House, to temper Trump's agenda.\n\nLobbying has yielded some early results: a pro-environment voting bloc in Congress, the Climate Solutions Caucus, for example, has signed on more Republicans in the last two months than in it had in the final year of Obama's administration - its first year in existence.\n\nUrged on by a coalition of conservative and religious groups, including the Catholic Climate Covenant, a handful of additional Republicans have also signed a congressional resolution pledging to address climate change.\n\nThe resolution was non-binding, but it represented a direct challenge to Trump's climate stance, a high-profile signal of dissent within his party.\n\n\"It's like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 you've got to first recognize you've got a problem before you can deal with it,\" said Mark Sanford, a Republican Congressman from South Carolina who signed the resolution.\n\nMelinda Pierce, legislative director for the more than 100-year-old Sierra Club environmental group, said she was happy to see \"enlightened Republicans\" beginning to act on climate change.

He has overturned several Obama-era environmental regulations, and last week he proposed slashing the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 percent.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign Trump called climate change a \"hoax\" and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a global pact to fight it \u2013 tapping into a well of Republican concern that the United States' energy habits would be policed by the United Nations.\n\nBut Republican bias against climate science is out of step with the majority of Americans. A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a majority of Republican supporters agree the United States should play a leading role in combating climate change.\n\n\"It shouldn't surprise anyone that more and more Republicans are interested in this issue,\" said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida. \"This issue was regrettably politicized some 20 or so years ago, and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out.\"\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nOn Feb. 8, representatives from a newly formed group of Republican statesmen, the Climate Leadership Council, including former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and James A.

Speaking on the \"Fox News Sunday\" television program, he said leaders were working to address concerns that had been raised by rank-and-file Republicans to the legislation.\n\nRepublicans remain deeply divided over the healthcare overhaul, which is President Donald Trump's first major legislative initiative. It aims to fulfill his campaign pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the signature healthcare program of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nDemocrats say the Republican plan could throw millions off health insurance and hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the rich.\n\n\"We think we should be offering even more assistance than the bill currently does\" for lower-income people age 50 to 64, Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said of the tax credits for health insurance that are proposed in the legislation.\n\nRyan also said Republicans were working on changes that would allow federal block grants to states for Medicaid and permit states to impose a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients.\n\nTrump told reporters in a brief conversation aboard Air Force One that he had meetings about healthcare reform in Florida at the weekend and that the effort to sell the proposal was going well.\n\nHe has been wooing lawmakers to vote for the bill and won the backing of a dozen conservative lawmakers on Friday after an Oval Office meeting in which the president endorsed a work requirement and block-grant option for Medicaid.\n\nTrump is set to meet Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy special adviser under Obama who helped shape the Affordable Care Acton, at the White House on Monday, along with Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.\n\nBlock grants would give states a set amount of money to cover people on the Medicaid program and provide flexibility in spending decisions. However, there is no guarantee funding would keep up with future demands.\n\n\"TRYING TO FIX BILL\"\n\nWhile Ryan said he felt \"very good\" about the health bill's prospects in the House, a leading conservative lawmaker, Representative Mark Meadows, told the C-Span \"Newsmakers\" program that there were currently 40 Republican \"no\" votes in the House. Republicans hold a majority in the chamber but cannot afford to have more than 21 defections for the measure to pass.\n\nMeadows and two other Republican opponents of the bill, Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday \"negotiating with the president's team, trying to fix this bill,\" Cruz told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Meadows said the changes being considered for the Medicaid program would not go far enough if they left it up to states to decide whether to put in place a work requirement.\n\nPrice acknowledged the tough negotiations, telling ABC's \"This Week\": \"It's a fine needle that needs to be thread, there's no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe healthcare bill would face significant challenges in the Senate even if it were to pass the House.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, a conservative Arkansas Republican, said the bill would not reduce premiums for people on the private insurance market. \"It's fixable, but it's going to take a lot of work,\" Cotton said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nModerate Republicans have also expressed concerns about the bill, and their worries are often not the same as that of conservatives.\n\nSpeaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine worried the bill would harm older Americans, and shift Medicaid costs to states - something critics say a block-grant approach would only make worse.\n\nCollins said coverage issues must also be dealt with, citing a report from the Congressional Budget Office that said 14 million people would lose health coverage under the House bill over the next year and 24 million over the next decade.\n\nAffordability has been one of the bigger concerns that insurers and hospital groups have raised about the legislation. To the extent that a change in tax credits makes healthcare more affordable for some people, insurers and hospitals could stand to benefit.\n\nThe BlueCross BlueShield Association emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable when the draft of the healthcare bill was released earlier this month. The association represents BCBS insurers that cover the vast majority of the roughly 10 million people enrolled in 2017 Obamacare plans.", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16Q0OR"}, {"title": "Comey confirms FBI probing alleged Russian interference in U.S. vote", "text": "FBI Director James Comey waits before testifying at a House Intelligence Committee hearing into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, on Capitol Hill.

And the Trump administration has not yet decided on the specific policies it will use to make good on campaign pledges to shrink U.S. trade deficits and grow American manufacturing jobs.\n\nOptions under consideration range from more aggressive anti-dumping enforcement efforts to renegotiating trade deals and enacting a proposed border tax levied on imports. During his campaign, Trump threatened unilateral tariffs on Mexican and Chinese goods and said he would quit the North American Free Trade agreement unless it is renegotiated to his liking.\n\n\"We have a new administration in Washington which still has to define precisely its narrative, especially in the context of what was said in the campaign,\" said Pierre Moscovici, European Commission Economic Affairs Minister.\n\n\"I think Mnuchin is an articulate, constructive and pragmatic man,\" Moscovici said. \"More work needs to be done to find common ground. It was not ready here. It is not a total surprise.\"\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who tangled with Mnuchin's predecessor, Jack Lew, last year over dollar-yen exchange rate volatility, said he was impressed with Mnuchin's understanding of economics and financial markets.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I think we can do good business together,\" Aso told reporters.\n\nIn the G20 plenary sessions, Mnuchin took to the floor only once, reading from a prepared statement, according to a G20 official, while counterparts from China and France argued forcefully in favor of keeping the anti-protectionism pledge.\n\nWhile Mnuchin concentrated on making good first impressions with his G20 counterparts, U.S. negotiators behind the scenes insisted that they could no longer accept previous language vowing \"to resist all forms of protectionism.\"\n\nThis was replaced with a watered-down pledge to \"strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies\" - language viewed by some participants as preserving U.S. flexibility on trade policy.\n\nGerman Finance Minster Wolfgang Schaeuble, who met with Mnuchin in Berlin before the Baden Baden meeting, said consensus could not be reached on the meaning of protectionism..\n\nHe suggested at a news conference that Mnuchin may not have had a clear mandate to negotiate on trade issues.\n\nAsked about this, Mnuchin said he knows Trump's desires on trade and negotiated them from Baden Baden, adding: \"the new language makes sense.\"\n\nRITUALISTIC PHRASE\n\nThe deletion of a \"ritualistic phrase\" in the G20's core language could over time diminish U.S. influence, said Eswar Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official and trade policy professor at Cornell University.\n\n\"The U.S. may have won this battle by forcefully imposing its will on the rest of the G20, but the outcome represents a step backward in U.S. global leadership on issues such as the promotion of free trade and tackling climate change,\" said Prasad.\n\nBut the Baden Baden meeting established Mnuchin as a pragmatic operator in the Trump administration's drive for a more level playing field on trade, said Domenico Lombardi, another former IMF official now with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.\n\n\"It'd be in the interest of Germany and Europe to establish a strong, bilateral relationship with the new Treasury secretary rather than questioning his authority,\" Lombardi said. \"The alternative for them would be to negotiate directly with Trump and that would be worse.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski and Leika Kihara; Editing by Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-usa-analysis-idUSKBN16R09Y"}, {"title": "U.S. officials meet asylum seekers at Australian-run camp, possibly restarting 'dumb deal'", "text": "CANBERRA/PERTH U.S. officials began taking fingerprints of asylum seekers in an Australian-run camp on the Pacific island of Nauru on Monday, signaling that vetting of applicants for resettlement in what U.S. President Donald Trump called a \"dumb deal\" has restarted.\n\nAustralia agreed with former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year for the United States to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in much criticized processing camps on Papua New Guinea and Nauru.

REUTERS\n\nNew York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday unveiled a $1.8 billion highway reconstruction plan in New York City's South Bronx aimed at benefiting one of the world's biggest food markets and an area once seen as a symbol of urban blight.\n\nIt was the latest public works plan announced by Cuomo at a time when such projects are increasingly on the national agenda. Republican President Donald Trump has vowed to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, which the American Society of Civil Engineers has given a near-failing grade.\n\nCuomo's highway project in the Bronx, the poorest of New York's five boroughs, would rebuild the Bruckner-Sheridan highway interchange to allow the area's largely black and Hispanic residents easier access to parkland and the Bronx River on the other side, Cuomo said.\n\nThe plan also calls for new highway ramps to give vehicles direct access to the Hunts Point Market, one of the biggest food distribution sites in the world. Residents have long complained of respiratory problems from the 13,000 trucks daily that spew exhaust as they rumble through local streets.\n\n\"The best future for the Bronx is ahead and we're going to lead a Bronx that is better than any Bronx that has ever been,\" Cuomo said in announcing the project.\n\nThe project is expected to generate 4,250 jobs and will be completed in multiple phases, he said.

I express my appreciation for this,\" Xi said.\n\nXi said he had communicated with President Donald Trump several times through telephone conversations and messages.\n\n\"We both believe that China-U.S. cooperation henceforth is the direction we are both striving for. We are both expecting a new era for constructive development,\" Xi said.\n\n\"The joint interests of China and the United States far outweigh the differences, and cooperation is the only correct choice for us both,\" Xi added, in comments carried by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nChina and the United States must strengthen coordination of hot regional issues, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and protect the broad stability of ties, Xi said.\n\nTillerson replied that Trump looks forward to enhancing understanding with China and the opportunity for a visit in the future.\n\nTillerson said Trump places a \"very high value on the communications that have already occurred\" between Xi and Trump.\n\n\"And he looks forward to enhancing that understanding in the opportunity for a visit in the future,\" Tillerson said.\n\n\"We know that through further dialogue we will achieve a greater understanding that will lead to a strengthened, strengthening of the ties between China and the United States and set the tone for our future relationship of cooperation.\"\n\nTrump has so far been an unpredictable partner for China, attacking Beijing on issues ranging from trade to the South China Sea and in December by talking to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nBefore Tillerson arrived in Beijing on Saturday, Trump said North Korea was \"behaving very badly\" and accused China of doing little to resolve the crisis over the North's weapons programs.\n\nSOME PROGRESS\n\nSpeaking in Seoul on Friday, Tillerson issued the Trump administration's starkest warning yet to North Korea, saying in Seoul that a military response would be \"on the table\" if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korean and U.S. forces.\n\nStill, China and the United States appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Xi and Trump.\n\nBoth Tillerson and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi struck a more conciliatory tone in their meeting, with Tillerson saying the United States and China would work together to get nuclear-armed North Korea take \"a different course\".\n\nUnderscoring the tensions, North Korea conducted a test of a new high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station and leader Kim Jong Un said the successful test was \"a new birth\" of its rocket industry, Pyongyang's official media said on Sunday.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches, in defiance of U.N. sanctions, and is believed by experts and government officials to be working to develop nuclear-warhead missiles that could reach the United States.\n\nWashington wants China, the North's neighbor and main trading partner, to use its influence to rein in the weapons programs.\n\nChina says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but all sides have a responsibility to lessen tensions and get back to the negotiating table.\n\nChinese official also repeatedly say they do not have the influence over North Korea that Washington and others believe, and express fears poverty-struck North Korea could collapse if it were cut off completely, pushing destabilizing waves of refugees into northeastern China.\n\n(Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tillerson-asia-china-idUSKBN16Q038"}, {"title": "White House tax reform may begin in late spring: Spicer", "text": "FILE PHOTO: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer holds his daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 16, 2017.

REUTERS/ Mark Schiefelbein\n\nBEIJING The United States and China will work together to get nuclear-armed North Korea take \"a different course\", U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday, softening previous criticism of Beijing after talks with his Chinese counterpart.\n\nChina has been irritated at being repeatedly told by Washington to rein in North Korea's surging nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, one of a series of hurdles in ties between the world's two largest economies.\n\nBut Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the talks with Tillerson as \"candid, pragmatic and productive\". The two sides appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Friday, Tillerson issued the Trump administration's starkest warning yet to North Korea, saying in Seoul that a military response would be \"on the table\" if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korean and U.S. forces.\n\nTillerson took a softer line after the meeting with Wang. He told reporters both China and the United States noted efforts over the last two decades had not succeeded in curbing the threat posed by North Korea's weapons programmes.\n\n\"We share a common view and a sense that tensions on the peninsula are quite high right now and that things have reached a rather dangerous level, and we've committed ourselves to doing everything we can to prevent any type of conflict from breaking out,\" Tillerson said.\n\nHe said Wang and he agreed to work together to persuade North Korea \"make a course correction and move away from the development of their nuclear weapons.\"\n\nWang said U.N. resolutions on North Korea both mapped out sanctions and called for efforts to resume efforts for a negotiated settlement.\n\n\"No matter what happens, we have to stay committed to diplomatic means as a way to seek peaceful settlement,\" he said.\n\nWang said he and Tillerson \"both hope to find ways to restart the talks\".\n\n\"Neither of us are ready to give up the hope for peace,\" he said.\n\nTillerson had said on Friday that any talks on North Korea could only take place after it began the process of unwinding its weapons programmes.\n\nA U.S. official had told Reuters in Washington earlier this week that Tillerson may raise the prospect of imposing \"secondary sanctions\" on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions.\n\nTrump said in a tweet on Friday that North Korea was \"behaving very badly\" and accused China, Pyongyang's neighbour and only major ally, of doing little to resolve the crisis.\n\nXI-TRUMP SUMMIT\n\nHowever, the two sides appear to have toned down differences as they work on finalising a trip by Xi to the United States, possibly next month, for his first summit with Trump.\n\nWang said the two countries were in \"close communication\" on arranging the meeting, but gave no details.\n\nThe state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said on Saturday that it was in China's interests to stop North Korea's nuclear ambitions but to suggest China cut the country off completely was ridiculous as it would be fraught with danger.\n\n\"Once there is chaos in North Korea, it would first bring disaster to China. I'm sorry, but the United States and South Korea don't have the right to demand this of China,\" it said in an editorial.\n\nA former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, Tillerson will meet Xi on Sunday.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the beginning of last year.\n\nLast week, it launched four more ballistic missiles and is working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States.\n\nWashington has been pressing Beijing to do more to stop North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.\n\nChina has called for a dual track approach, urging North Korea to suspend its tests and the United States and South Korea to suspend military drills, so both sides can return to talks.\n\nChina has also been infuriated by the deployment of the THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, missile defence system in South Korea, which it says will both harm China's own security and do nothing to ease tensions.\n\nChina says the system's powerful radar will extend into the country's northeast and potentially track Chinese missile launches, and maybe even intercept them. Russia also opposes THAAD, for the same reasons.\n\nThere are other tricky issues too, including the self-ruled island of Taiwan which China claims as its own.\n\nThe Trump administration is crafting a big new arms package for Taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti-ship missiles to defend against China, U.S. officials said, a deal sure to anger Beijing.\n\nWang said Saturday's talks included discussions on THAAD and Taiwan but did not give details.\n\n(Additional reporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tillerson-asia-china-idUSKBN16O2V9"}, {"title": "Meals on Wheels America sees surge in donations after U.S. budget", "text": "NEW YORK Meals on Wheels America, the umbrella organization for 5,000 providers of home-delivered meals for seniors, said on Saturday that online donations have surged since the White House released a proposed budget that could lead to a big drop in its funding.\n\nThe organization, which provides advocacy services for the national network, received about $50,000 on Thursday after the budget blueprint was announced, compared with $1,000 on a typical day.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first budget proposal includes a 17.9 percent cut for fiscal 2018 in funds for the Department of Health and Human Services, which provides most of the government support for Meals on Wheels, the organization said.\n\nThe budget proposal did not say how the cut would affect the Administration for Community Living, the HHS agency that funds nutrition programs for the elderly, Meals on Wheels spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette said.\n\nMeals on Wheels said on its website that it is difficult to imagine a scenario under which the next federal budget would not have an impact on its services.\n\n\"While Meals on Wheels America and local Meals on Wheels programs are seeing an uptick in giving, it does not replace federal funding,\" Bertolette told Reuters in an email.\n\nThe White House referred questions about the HHS budget to the department.\n\nAn HHS representative referred to a statement from Secretary Tom Price released earlier this week. \"HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our department\u2019s mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people.

They were chosen because they are cities which have high populations of illegal immigrants with criminal charges, the officials said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department's Executive Office of Immigration Review, which administers immigration courts, confirmed that the cities have been identified as likely recipients of reassigned immigration judges, but did not elaborate on the planning.\n\nThe plan to intensify deportations is in line with a vow made frequently by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year to deport more illegal immigrants involved in crime.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security asked for the judges' reshuffle, an unusual move given that immigration courts are administered by the Department of Justice. A Homeland Security spokeswoman declined to comment on any plan that has not yet been finalized.\n\nUnder an executive order signed by Trump in January, illegal immigrants with pending criminal cases are regarded as priorities for deportation whether they have been found guilty or not.\n\nThat is a departure from former President Barack Obama's policy, which prioritized deportations only of those convicted of serious crimes.\n\nThe policy shift has been criticized by advocate groups who say it unfairly targets immigrants who might ultimately be acquitted and do not pose a threat.\n\nThe cities slated to receive more judges have more than half of the 18,013 pending immigration cases that involve undocumented immigrants facing or convicted of criminal charges, according to data provided by the Justice Department's Executive Office of Immigration Review.\n\nMore than 200 of those cases involve immigrants currently incarcerated, meaning that the others have either not been convicted or have served their sentence. The Justice Department did not provide a breakdown of how many of the remainder have been convicted and how many are awaiting trial.\n\nAs part of the Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Justice Department is also sending immigration judges to detention centers along the southwest border. Those temporary redeployments will begin Monday.\n\n'AIMLESS DOCKET RESHUFFLING'\n\nFormer immigration judge and chairman of the Board of Immigration Appeals Paul Schmidt said the Trump administration should not assume that all those charged with crimes would not be allowed to stay in the United States legally.\n\n\"It seems they have an assumption that everyone who has committed a crime should be removable, but that's not necessarily true. Even people who have committed serious crimes can sometimes get asylum,\" Schmidt said.\n\nHe also questioned the effectiveness of shuffling immigration judges from one court to another, noting that this will mean cases the judges would have handled in their usual courts will have to be rescheduled. He said that when he was temporarily reassigned to handle cases on the southern border in 2014 and 2015, cases he was slated to hear in his home court in Arlington, Virginia had to be postponed, often for more than a year.\n\n\"That's what you call aimless docket reshuffling,\" he said.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, to avoid the expense and disruption of immigration judges traveling, they would often hear proceedings from other courthouses via video conference.\n\nThe judges' reshuffling could further logjam a national immigration court system which has more than 540,000 pending cases.\n\nThe cities slated to receive more judges have different kinds of immigrant populations.\n\nImperial, California, for example, is in one of the nation's largest agriculture hubs, attracting large numbers of immigrant farmworkers from Mexico and Central America.\n\nBloomington, Minnesota, near St. Paul, is home to a large number of African immigrants, many of whom traveled from war-torn countries like Somalia to claim asylum in the United States.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley; Editing by Sue Horton and Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-judges-exclusive-idUSKBN16O2S6"}, {"title": "In talks with U.S., China calls for diplomacy on North Korea", "text": "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (2nd, L) meets U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (2nd, R) at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on March 18, 2017 in Beijing, China.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nNEW YORK The U.S. government took the legal battle over President Donald Trump's travel ban to a higher court on Friday, saying it would appeal against a federal judge's decision that struck down parts of the ban on the day it was set to go into effect.\n\nThe Department of Justice said in a court filing it would appeal against a ruling by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn Thursday, Chuang issued an emergency halt to the portion of Trump's March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. He left in place the section of the order that barred the entry of refugees to the United States for four months.\n\nAnother federal judge in Hawaii struck down both sections of the ban in a broader court ruling that prevented Trump's order from moving forward.\n\nIn Washington state, where the ban is also being challenged, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart put a stay on proceedings for as long as the Hawaii court's nationwide temporary restraining order remained in place, to \"conserve resources\" and avoid inconsistent and duplicate rulings.\n\nThe decisions came in response to lawsuits brought by states' attorneys general in Hawaii and refugee resettlement agencies in Maryland who were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nDetractors argue the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom. Trump says the measure is necessary for national security to protect the country from terrorist attacks.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a media briefing the government would \"vigorously defend this executive order\" and appeal against the \"flawed rulings.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a motion late on Friday night seeking clarification of Hawaii\u2019s ruling before appealing to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.\n\nThe 9th Circuit court last month upheld a decision by Judge Robart that halted an original, more sweeping travel ban signed by the President on Jan. 27 in response to a lawsuit filed by Washington state.\n\nThe new executive order was reissued with the intention of overcoming the legal concerns.\n\nTrump has vowed to take the fight all the way to U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 4th Circuit is known as a more conservative court compared to the 9th Circuit, said Buzz Frahn, an attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett who has been tracking the litigation nationwide.\n\n\"The government is probably thinking that the 4th Circuit ... would lend a friendlier ear to its arguments,\" he said.\n\nJudges have said they were willing to look behind the text of the order, which does not mention Islam, to probe the motivation for enacting the ban, Frahn said. Trump promised during the election campaign to ban Muslims from entering the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives, with Trump's pick for the high court - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, from the Washington D.C.-based Heritage Foundation, said the Department of Justice might want to time their appeals to reach the Supreme Court after Gorsuch is confirmed.

FBI director James Comey and the leaders or former leaders of most of the major U.S. intelligence agencies have been invited to testify.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said he does not know yet whether the panel is capable of conducting a credible investigation.\n\nSENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting its own investigation. Also started before Trump took office, it is considered the most robust congressional action.\n\nIts chairman, Richard Burr, was re-elected in November in the Republican sweep that carried Trump into office and preserved Republican control of Congress. Although he was a Trump supporter during the campaign, he is not as closely linked with the president as Nunes is. But he also made calls to reporters as the White House tried to dispute allegations about campaign contacts with Russia.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the committee's Democratic vice chairman, said he had \"grave concerns\" about the independence of the committee's probe after the report that Burr had helped the White House dispute the stories.\n\nBurr and Warner have expressed fewer concerns than members of the House committee about the amount of information that intelligence agencies have provided to them.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee will hold an open hearing on Russian efforts to influence campaigns more generally, on March 30. The witness list includes experts, not current Trump administration or intelligence community officials.\n\nSENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Sheldon Whitehouse, its ranking Democrat, announced that they, too, would investigate Russian attempts to influence the election.\n\nThey also have asked the FBI and the Justice Department to produce any information that supports Trump's unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe full Judiciary Committee is also investigating. Its chairman, Chuck Grassley, and top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, have had officials brief panel members.\n\nGrassley and Feinstein also sent a joint letter to Comey asking for a briefing and transcripts and documents of calls between Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\n\nHOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Committee Democrats tried to force the committee to ask the Department of Justice to produce records of its investigation into whether Trump or his campaign had ties to Russia, but panel Republicans blocked the effort.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Representative Bob Goodlatte, said instead that he would urge the government to continue its investigation.\n\nHowever, Goodlatte said he had asked the Justice Department to brief the committee, and had not had a response.\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - Jason Chaffetz, the committee's Republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the Trump administration. After Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's national security adviser because of his calls to Russia's ambassador, Chaffetz said his panel would not look into the issue.\n\nHe has, however, signed letters seeking related information, and he was among the first lawmakers to call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from Russia-related investigations because of his contacts with Kislyak.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by John Walcott and Tom Brown)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-congress-factbox-idUSKBN16O2RY"}, {"title": "South Dakota's governor vetoes loosening of concealed carry gun laws", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota listens to remarks during a discussion at the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington, February 23, 2014.

That package was worth $1 billion, Washington's Free Beacon newspaper reported this week, citing unnamed officials, who also were quoted as saying the Trump administration was now preparing new sales.\n\nNed Price, a National Security Council spokesman under Obama, said the previous administration put a \"relatively modest\" arms package for Taiwan on hold, in part to let the new administration make the decision.\n\nThe Trump administration source told Reuters that the new deals under consideration would likely top the $1 billion mark.\n\nThe new administration plans to focus more than the previous one on enhancing Taiwan's \"asymmetric\" capabilities, possibly with advanced multiple launch rocket systems, anti-ship missiles and other technologies that would enable Taiwan's military to defend against a much larger Chinese force in the event of an attack, the U.S. official said.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) is the top U.S. manufacturer of multiple launch rocket systems.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump's first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance on Thursday from his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs.\n\nConservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 percent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico.\n\nIt also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives.\n\nBut the gaze into Trump's priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans' taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months.\n\nAlthough Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents' budget plans.\n\nThe administration asked Congress for a 28 percent, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10 percent, $54 billion hike in military spending next year.\n\n\"These increases in defense come at the expense of national security,\" said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters' questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process.\n\nThe budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability.\n\nELECTION PROMISES\n\nThe White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises.\n\n\"The president said, specifically, hundreds of times - you covered him - 'I'm going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home' and that's exactly what we're doing with this budget,\" Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters.\n\nDemocrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor.\n\nThe White House proposal would inflict a 31 percent, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA.\n\nSome veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA's Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate.\n\nModerate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs.\n\nLisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska.\n\n\"We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt,\" Murkowski said.\n\nIn fact, those \"discretionary\" programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget.\n\nThe biggest portion of the budget - about $2.4 trillion - is for \"mandatory entitlement\" programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled.\n\nConservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year.\n\nTrump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget.\n\nOther discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs.\n\n\"Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America\u2019s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened,\" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDEFENSE MONEY FOR CURRENT YEAR\n\nTrump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems.\n\nAbout $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N).\n\nAlso for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign.\n\nCongress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies.\n\nThe budget outline also does not incorporate Trump's plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come.\n\nThe planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit.\n\nDespite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their \"core functions\" would be preserved.\n\nReflecting Trump's repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said.\n\nThe estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.\n\n(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsely, Patricia Zengerle, Timothy Gardner and Valerie Volcovici in Washington and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Frances Kerry and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-idUSKBN16M1DO"}, {"title": "Trump budget would slash cleanup of hazardous waste sites by 30 percent", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), speaks to employees of the agency in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2017.

Residents complain of higher rates of cancers, bloody noses or asthma.\n\n\"I don't see how this is going to speed up anything,\" Chapman said of the proposed smaller budget.\n\nChapman, who has three children with special needs, is unsure whether the landfill is the cause of their issues. She wants the cleanup to move ahead, but is not confident the state could handle the matter any better.\n\nMichael McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist, said asking an organization to do their job with a little bit less is not unusual, and the EPA will find efficiencies.\n\n\"It's a bit premature to declare the sky is falling,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the EPA said the agency needs to operate better with less, and work more closely with the private sector and states to get back to its core mission.\n\n\"The problem I have with the EPA, it's turned into more of an ideological group more concerned with spreading a liberal message (President Barack) Obama had,\" said Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n\nInhofe has been critical of what he characterized as overreach by the EPA, as well as its rule making and bureaucracy under Obama.\n\nHowever, some environmental groups argue that the shifting the work to the states is not the answer.\n\nMike Scott, a senior organizing representative with the Sierra Club in Montana, said that state got $37 million from the EPA last year for its 16 Superfund sites.

REUTERS/Valerie Volcovici\n\nPAINTSVILLE, Kentucky President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating funding for economic development programs supporting laid-off coal miners and others in Appalachia, stirring fears in a region that supported him of another letdown on the heels of the coal industry\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe 2018 budget proposal submitted to Congress by the White House on Thursday would cut funds to the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The Washington-based organizations are charged with diversifying the economies of states like West Virginia and Kentucky to help them recover from coal\u2019s decline.\n\nThe proposed cuts would save the federal government $340 million and come as the Republican president seeks to slash a wide array of federal programs and regulations to make way for increased military spending.\n\nBut they are perceived by some in Appalachia as a betrayal of his promises to help coal miners.\n\n\"Folks that live in Appalachia believe that the ARC belongs to them,\" said federal ARC Co-Chair Earl Gohl, bemoaning the proposed cut. \"It's really their organization.\"\n\nRepublican Congressman Hal Rogers, who represents eastern Kentucky's coal counties, said he would fight to restore the funding when Congress negotiates the budget later this year.\n\n\u201cIt's true that the president won his election in rural country. I would really like to see him climb aboard the ARC vehicle as a way to help us help ourselves,\" Rogers said.\n\nFour hundred of the 420 counties ARC operates in voted for Trump in November's election.\n\nThe 52-year old agency has run more than 650 projects in Appalachia's 13 states between 2011 and 2015 costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Its programs, some launched under Democratic former President Barack Obama, are expected to create or retain more than 23,670 jobs and train and educate over 49,000 students and workers, the organization said.\n\nTrump vowed during his campaign that the White House would put American coal miners back to work, in part by cutting environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, mainly aimed at curbing climate change but characterized by Trump as hampering the industry.\n\nHowever, many industry experts and coal miners doubt that rolling back regulation alone can revive the coal mining industry, which faces stiff competition from abundant and cheap natural gas in fueling U.S. power generation.\n\nTECHNOLOGY FUTURE?\n\nRigel Preston, a 38-year old former surface miner, said ARC programs helped him land a job as a paid intern at technology company Interapt after he lost his benefits.\n\nHe said that, while he and many members of his family in eastern Kentucky hope Trump will deliver on his promise to revive the coal industry, he believed the region's future lay elsewhere.\n\n\"From my experience from the coalfield, I know that that is a finite job and coal will run out eventually,\" Preston said.\n\nPreston was among several former miners and other east Kentuckians at an event in Paintsville this week held by Interapt and ARC to announce Interapt's plan to hire another hundred people from the region this summer.\n\nInterapt last year launched a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, supported by ARC, which provides 36 weeks of paid training in code and paid internships.\n\nInterapt Chief Executive Ankur Gopal, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur, expanded his Louisville-based company out to eastern Kentucky with the vision of lifting that part of his home state out of economic stagnation.\n\n\"There is a skilled workforce and opportunity that can be found here in eastern Kentucky,\" Gopal said. \"This is not just a bunch of people that are waiting for coal mines to reopen.\"\n\nARC has worked on economic development in Appalachia since its founding in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's \"war on poverty.\" In recent years it has focused on helping states in the region deal with the coal industry's sharp decline and the loss of 33,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2016.\n\nSo far, ARC has had no official contact from the president's transition teams, said co-chair Gohl, an Obama appointee who remains in the job.\n\nThe cuts to its funding were recommended to the administration by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. Nick Loris, an energy fellow at the foundation, said the work that ARC and the Economic Development Administration do should be devolved to state and local governments \"to encourage transparency and reduce duplicative federal spending.\"\n\nStates have said their budgets are already strapped.\n\nIn addition to all of West Virginia and part of Kentucky, the ARC covers parts of Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\n(Reporting By Valerie Volcovici; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-appalachia-idUSKBN16N2VF"}, {"title": "Tillerson avoids public conflict with Trump over budget", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson walks to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, prior to their meeting at the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan March 16, 2017.

Tillerson dined with Trump on Monday, the night before he flew to Asia.\n\nTillerson has kept a low profile since joining the administration seven weeks ago, spending little time with key State Department officials and only holding his first news conference on Thursday in Tokyo.\n\nHe has drawn criticism from many State Department officials who believe he has failed to cultivate potential allies in Trump's cabinet and on Capitol Hill.\n\nChas Freeman, a seasoned diplomat since the Nixon administration, said Tillerson's low-key style might be a survival tactic.\n\n\"If he says something, he runs a big risk of getting crosswise with Trump,\" Freeman said. \"This may be a Fabian strategy,\" referring to the Roman statesman Fabius who defeated the Carthaginian general Hannibal by avoiding frontal conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed and John Walcott; Editing by James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tillerson-idUSKBN16O07A"}, {"title": "Trump's proposal to scrap Chemical Safety Board draws criticism", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the annual Friends of Ireland St. Patrick\u2019s Day lunch honoring Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 16, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposal to do away with the federal agency that investigates chemical accidents drew sharp criticism from environmental, labor and safety advocates, who said that eliminating the watchdog would put American lives at risk.\n\nChristine Todd Whitman, the former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head, on Thursday called the proposal to get rid of Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and cut EPA funding short-sighted, saying both have long been an industry target for advocating greater public information on chemicals.\n\n\"If you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it,\" she said of the president's proposal to cut the CSB's funding entirely from the 2018 federal budget. \"The chemical industry has fought back from the beginning.\"\n\nThe CSB investigates major chemicals accidents to search for their causes and makes recommendations that could prevent a recurrence. It has no regulatory power, but is influential because its recommendations are often adopted by industry, labor, government officials, the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nThe president on Thursday outlined a plan for fiscal 2018 discretionary spending, which exclude programs like Social Security, that removes allocations for 19 independent bodies, including the CSB and Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nThe CSB, which has an annual budget of about $12 million, defended its work, saying its work has broadly improved safety. \"As this process moves forward, we hope that the important mission of this agency will be preserved,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nChemical and energy industry officials offered limited comment on the proposal. Petroleum and refining industry groups, Exxon Mobil Corp, BP plc and Tesoro Corp did not respond or declined to comment directly on the potential phase out.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council, a trade group that represents major chemicals producers, said in a statement it would work with the administration and Congress to \"ensure EPA has funding to carry out essential responsibilities.\" It did not comment directly on the CSB.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said it looked \"forward to working with the administration and Congress as all of these issues work their way through the budget process.\"\n\nMichael Wright, director of health, safety and environment at the United Steelworkers union, said the CSB's recommendations generally have been welcome by labor and industry. One such recommendation that stemmed from a fatal 2005 refinery incident included barring portable trailers that cannot withstand an explosion.\n\nThe board's reviews of major accidents have proved significant. Its probes have led to industry standards on worker fatigue, greater reporting of hazardous chemicals to first responders, and have prompted companies to keep workers not directly involved in projects out of harm's way.\n\nIn California, many of the board\u2019s safety recommendations have been drafted into law. For example, the state worker safety agency, known as Cal/OSHA, has doubled its investigative staff based on CSB recommendations.\n\n\"This is one of the best bargains in Washington,\" said the USW's Wright. \"If it has prevented even one accident, it has saved far more money than its budget over its entire history.\"\n\nIts probe of the fatal Deepwater Horizon rig explosion was controversial because of its two-year length and extensive need for outside help. The work led to new standards for safety in the offshore oil industry and in well equipment.\n\nBut some recommendations have not been yet been implemented. After a fatal 2013 explosion in West, Texas, that killed 12 first responders the CSB proposed facilities that store large amounts of fertilizer be covered by emergency planning laws that give first responders more information. That remains open.\n\nBeth Rosenberg, a former CSB board member and now an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the CSB \"does excellent work; other countries admire this agency.\" She said opponents \"don't know what they're doing here or how useful this board is.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liz Hampton and Erwin Seba; Editing by Ernest Scheyder and Diane Craft)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-csb-idUSKBN16O0FK"}, {"title": "Tillerson's use of email alias at Exxon 'entirely proper': Exxon attorneys", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson walks to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, prior to their meeting at the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan March 16, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nHONOLULU/NEW YORK A defiant President Donald Trump has pledged to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to fight for his revised travel ban, parts of which were halted by two different federal judges in recent days.\n\nThe legal path forward will be challenging, though, as lawsuits work their way through federal courts on opposite sides of the country, in Hawaii and Maryland. On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington state said he was also weighing a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe Justice Department's first step would likely be filing an appeal in either or both of the cases it lost this week, an action likely to come within days. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment on the administration's intentions.\n\nIn granting a temporary restraining order against the ban challenged in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson found on Wednesday that \"a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.\"\n\nTrump's executive order would temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries. The president has said the ban is needed for national security.\n\nEarly on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in a case in Maryland brought by refugee resettlement agencies represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nChuang ruled that the groups were likely to succeed in showing that the travel ban portion of the executive order was intended to be a ban on Muslims, and as a result, violates the U.S. Constitution's religious freedom guarantee. He did not enjoin the refugee portion of the ban.\n\n\"To avoid sowing seeds of division in our nation, upholding this fundamental constitutional principle at the core of our nation's identity plainly serves a significant public interest,\" Chuang wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe court orders, while victories for the plaintiffs, are only an early step in litigation and the government could ultimately win its underlying case. Watson and Chuang were appointed to the bench by former Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump, speaking after the Hawaii ruling at a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, called his revised executive order a \"watered-down version\" of his first.\n\nThe president said he would take the case \"as far as it needs to go,\" including to the Supreme Court, in order to get a ruling that the ban is legal.\n\nThe Trump administration won a small legal victory later on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who last month blocked Trump's first travel ban, ruled that the second travel ban was different enough from the first that he would not simply apply a preliminary injunction he issued against the first ban to the second one. He said he was weighing a request for a temporary restraining order on the new travel ban.\n\nThe likely next stops if the administration decides to contest the two rulings that it lost this week would be the 4th and 9th U.S. circuit courts of appeal. Both may be frosty venues for Trump's arguments, with majorities of the judges in each appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nThree judges on the 9th Circuit upheld Robart's order last month on the first travel ban. Rather than appeal further, the administration withdrew the ban, promising to retool it in ways that would address the legal issues.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently split between four conservative and four liberal justices, with no ninth justice since the death of Antonin Scalia more than a year ago.\n\nTrump's nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Neil Gorsuch, a 49-year-old conservative, is likely to be asked about the travel ban next week when he goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing.\n\nRepublicans are hoping that the Senate votes to confirm Gorsuch for the court by mid-April, which would likely be too late for him to weigh in on an emergency appeal about the travel ban.\n\nTrump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with his January executive order, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before Robart stopped its enforcement in February.\n\nWatson's order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. He set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in Honolulu, Mica Rosenberg in New York and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Toby Chopra and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKBN16N0YS"}, {"title": "Trump meets Irish PM at White House ahead of St. Patrick's Day", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., March 16, 2017.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON Deeply divided Republicans squeezed their U.S. healthcare overhaul, backed by President Donald Trump, through a key House of Representatives panel on Thursday despite defections by three conservatives who consider it too similar to the Obamacare law it is intended to replace.\n\nTrump's first major legislative initiative still faces an uphill battle in the full House and later the Senate despite ongoing efforts by the White House and Republican leaders to satisfy conservative opponents.\n\nThe Budget Committee vote was 19 to 17, with Republican Representatives David Brat, Gary Palmer and Mark Sanford - all members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus - joining the panel's Democrats in voting against it. The committee brought provisions approved last week by two other panels into a single bill, helping pave the way for a later vote on the House floor.\n\nRepublicans, who control Congress and the White House, could not afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass.\n\n\"I don't think we are anywhere near passage,\" Brat said after the vote, noting that Republican conservatives as well as moderates had problems with the bill.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of former President Barack Obama, enabled about 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical coverage. About half of those were through the law's expansion of eligibility and increased funding for the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe close vote illustrated the problems Republican leaders may encounter in corralling enough votes in their party to win passage on the House floor amid unified Democratic opposition. The measure now goes to the Rules Committee before reaching the House floor.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan congressional agency, forecast on Monday that the legislation would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 24 million by 2026, while cutting $337 billion from federal budget deficits over the same period. The bill faces opposition from leading healthcare providers, including doctors and hospitals.\n\n\"We are on track and on schedule,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who unveiled the legislation last week and is its chief champion in the House, said after the committee's vote. He added that while the main parts of the bill \"are going to stay exactly as they are,\" Republicans were making unspecified \"improvements and refinements.\"\n\nRyan told a news conference that Trump was \"deeply involved\" and \"helping bridge gaps\" among Republican lawmakers to get a consensus plan.\n\n'CONSTITUENCY OF ONE'\n\nConservatives were unmoved. \"There's no natural constituency for this bill,\" said Republican Representative Raul Labrador, another Freedom Caucus member.\n\n\"The Left is really mad about it. The Right is really mad about it. The middle is really mad about it. And so far it just seems to be a constituency of one, which is Washington insiders, people that are just trying to get something passed so they can get to the next issue.\"\n\nTrump administration officials and House Republican leaders have said they hope to get the bill to the House floor by the end of the month so it can go to the Senate before lawmakers' mid-April recess.\n\nConservatives want a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which the bill has set for 2020, and want to add work requirements for some Medicaid recipients. They also call the age-based tax credits to help people buy insurance on the open market an unwise new entitlement.\n\nThe White House said it was discussing changes with House Republican leaders. Trump told a Fox News interviewer on Wednesday that much of the bill would still be negotiated, especially as it moves from the House to the Senate.\n\nConservative advocacy groups praised the Republicans who voted \"no.\" Club for Growth President David McIntosh said it makes no sense for Ryan and Budget Committee chair Diane Black to force Republicans \"to walk the plank and vote for a bad bill that they've already admitted needs to be changed.\"\n\nBlack asked fellow Republicans who had doubts not to \"cut off the discussion\" by voting no.\n\nAfter approving the legislation, the panel adopted four non-binding Republican recommendations for changes before it moves to the House floor, including one by the conservative Palmer on adding work requirements for able-bodied, childless Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe other recommendations called for no longer encouraging people to sign up for insurance through Medicaid, giving states more flexibility in designing Medicaid programs, and changing the bill's tax credits to help lower-income people more.\n\nDemocrats have called the Republicans' plan a blow to the elderly and the poor while giving tax cuts to the rich.\n\nRepresentative John Yarmuth, the committee's top Democrat, said the legislation was \"not a healthcare bill; it is an ideological document.\" He said the bill imagined a \"fantasy land where young people don't get sick, and apparently they don't grow old either, because they don't have to worry about being priced out of the market.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Doina Chiacu, David Morgan and Yasmeen Abutaleb; Writing by Will Dunham; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16N1IK"}, {"title": "No charges for New York mayor in fundraising probes: prosecutors", "text": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio arrives at the City Hall in New York, U.S., March 16, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks during a news conference in New York City, U.S., February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nNEW YORK Federal and state prosecutors said on Thursday they would not bring criminal charges against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio or his aides in two simultaneous year-long investigations into his fundraising practices.\n\nBut the mayor's conduct was criticized by prosecutors, with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance saying de Blasio's fundraising for other Democratic candidates in 2014 appeared to violate the \"intent and spirit\" of state campaign finance laws.\n\nThe decisions are a victory for de Blasio, who was dogged by questions about the probes as he prepared to run for re-election this year.\n\nIt is unusual for prosecutors to announce the conclusion of criminal inquiries. In a statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said it was done \"in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election.\"\n\nAt a news conference, de Blasio said the statements confirmed he and his administration had acted lawfully. He dismissed questions pointing out that prosecutors criticized his actions despite deciding not to pursue a case.\n\n\"I do not agree with some of the characterizations,\" he said. \"What matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year, and no charges have been brought.\"\n\nU.S. prosecutors had probed whether the de Blasio administration gave favors to donors who contributed either to his campaign or to a nonprofit organization set up to promote his political agenda.\n\nIn a statement, Kim said his office had investigated \"several circumstances\" in which the mayor or his associates contacted or directed agencies on behalf of donors.\n\nThe decision not to prosecute, Kim said, was made based on several factors, including \"the particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit.\"\n\nVance's office separately examined whether de Blasio steered campaign contributions to county committees in order to sidestep New York state campaign finance limits.\n\nIn a 10-page letter to the state Board of Elections, whose own inquiry led to his investigation, Vance detailed how de Blasio and his allies sought to help Democrats win a majority in the state Senate in 2014.\n\nWealthy donors were encouraged to give to county committees rather than individual candidates because the limits are much higher for the committees.\n\nThe money then flowed from the committees to individual candidates, often within days. While each individual transaction appeared lawful, the overall effect was to evade campaign finance law by creating an \"end run\" around contribution limits, Vance said.\n\nBut Vance said the transfers were approved by an election law attorney working with the coordinated campaign. Under the law, an individual who acts on the advice of an attorney is typically shielded from prosecution.\n\nThe conclusion not to bring charges \"is not an endorsement of the conduct at issue,\" wrote Vance.\n\nThough City Hall was spared, the investigations have previously uncovered multiple unrelated schemes, including some involving high-ranking police officials.\n\nThe federal probe was initially centered on two businessmen, Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg, who helped raise money for de Blasio in 2013 and 2014.\n\nReichberg and several police officials were charged in June with a bribery scheme involving prostitutes and luxury trips. Rechnitz had already pleaded guilty in secret and cooperated with investigators.\n\nHis assistance also helped prosecutors build a case against the once-powerful head of the city's correction officers union, Norman Seabrook, who was charged alongside a hedge fund financier with secretly investing union pension funds in exchange for kickbacks.\n\nIn yet another fraud linked to the probe, U.S. prosecutors charged two police officers and a Brooklyn man, Alex Lichtenstein, in a bribery scheme involving gun licenses. He was sentenced to more than 2-1/2 years in prison on Thursday after pleading guilty.\n\nAnother peripheral figure, restaurateur Hamlet Peralta, was charged last year with running a $12 million Ponzi scheme in a case that grew out of the probe.\n\nSeveral high-ranking police officials have been disciplined as a result of the investigation into Rechnitz and Reichberg.\n\n(Additional reporting by Laila Kearney, Jonathan Stempel, Jonathan Allen and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Bill Trott, Jeffrey Benkoe and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-mayor-idUSKBN16N1Z2"}, {"title": "EPA hit hardest as Trump budget targets regulations", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump attends a meeting with U.S. House Deputy Whip team at the East room of the White House in Washington, U.S. March 7, 2017.

REUTERS/George Frey\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump's administration on Thursday proposed a 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency's budget, as the White House seeks to eliminate climate change programs and trim initiatives to protect air and water quality.\n\nThe EPA would sustain the biggest cut of any federal agency in the White House 2018 budget, as Trump seeks to clear away regulations he claims are hobbling U.S. oil drillers, coal miners and farmers.\n\nThe proposed cuts are a starting point, and Congress could temper them in its budget deliberations.\n\nThe proposal would slash funding for enforcing regulations, fighting water pollution, cleaning up sites contaminated by toxic waste and promoting energy-efficient appliances. It would eliminate 3,200 EPA employees, or 19 percent of the agency's workforce.\n\nIt would effectively erase former President Barack Obama's initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agency's signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"Consistent with the President's America First Energy Plan, the budget reorients the EPA's air program to protect the air we breathe without unduly burdening the American economy,\" a summary of the proposed EPA budget said.\n\nSome lawmakers from Trump's Republican party praised the proposed cuts, but some expressed concern about cuts to programs affecting their region of the country. Environmentalists blasted the plan, saying it would return America back to 1977 when smoggy skies and polluted rivers pushed lawmakers to strengthen federal clean air and clean water laws.\n\nScott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, disputes the scientific consensus that human actions are the lead cause of climate change. In his former position as attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma, he sued the EPA more than a dozen times.\n\nPruitt believes Congress should determine whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant that needs regulation. With both chambers currently led by Republicans, and influential committees headed by lawmakers from oil-producing states, that is unlikely anytime soon.\n\nThe budget would also eliminate some $100 million in spending on research and international programs on combating climate change.\n\nTrump also doubts the science of climate change and has said the country can reduce green regulations drastically without compromising air and water quality.\n\nAsked about climate change programs, Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, told reporters \"we consider that to be a waste of your money.\"\n\n\"I think the president is fairly straightforward. We're not spending money on that,\" he said.\n\nThe EPA had already faced sharp cuts under Obama. Janet McCabe, a former EPA air official, said Trump's proposed budget would harm the EPA's ability to respond to emergencies and also hurt day-to-day efforts on keeping air and water clean to protect human health.\n\nTURN BACK THE CLOCK\n\nThe proposed cuts would cut $427 million aimed at regional pollution cleanup programs, including in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. Funding for the Superfund program to clean up the nation's most contaminated sites would drop by $330 million to $762 million.\n\nThe summary said the budget seeks to give local and state governments responsibility for such clean-up efforts. Many states and municipalities also face severe budget constraints in the current fiscal environment.\n\nTrump's proposal includes a 31 percent budget cut for the enforcement division, which fines companies for pollution. It would ax dozens of other programs including the popular Energy Star appliance efficiency program aimed at reducing U.S. energy consumption.\n\n\"Turning back the clock to 1977 will not 'Make America Great Again'. It will 'Make America Gag Again,'\" said Conrad Schneider, the advocacy director at Clean Air Task Force.\n\nOne area that would see a small boost is for State Revolving Funds, low-interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure. The plan would add $4 million to the funds, bringing its budget up to $100 million.\n\nWhile employees at EPA headquarters in Washington worried about their jobs, some hoped opportunities might open up at the other side of the country.\n\nRepresentatives of California, where state energy commissions and a clean air agency are hiring, handed recruitment fliers to EPA employees on their way to work.\n\nThe fliers said: \"Fight Climate Change, Work for California.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Leslie Adler and Chizu Nomiyama)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-epa-idUSKBN16N0E1"}, {"title": "Leading Republicans, Democrats reject Trump's Obama wiretap assertion", "text": "WASHINGTON The leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan statement on Thursday rejecting President Donald Trump's assertion that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, added his voice to a growing chorus of lawmakers saying there was no sign of a wiretap.\n\nIn a testy briefing with reporters, White House spokesman Sean Spicer forcefully defended the president, citing news reports of intelligence collection on possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia in the presidential campaign.\n\n\"There is no question that there were surveillance techniques used throughout this,\" Spicer said.\n\nThe Republican president, without providing evidence, has accused his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, of wiretapping him near the end of the campaign.

He said reporters had not focused enough on comments from officials denying evidence of any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Russian government has rejected an accusation by U.S. intelligence agencies that it worked to influence the election in Trump's favor by hacking computer systems, among other methods.\n\nTrump has been dogged by allegations that his associates had ties to Russian officials. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, last month after he failed to disclose contacts with Russia's ambassador before Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nAn official familiar with the investigations by Congress and intelligence and law enforcement agencies said investigators had looked as aggressively and thoroughly as they could for evidence of any spying on Trump or his associates but had found none.\n\nOn March 4, six weeks after he took over from Obama, Trump made the wiretap accusations in a Twitter post.\n\n\"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump's proposal to defund programs to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes, two of the country's largest water systems, brought scorn on Thursday from a bipartisan array of lawmakers who vowed to fight the cuts.\n\nMembers of Congress said the proposal to wipe out Environmental Protection Agency funds to clean up the Great Lakes and the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem threatened the environment as well as tens of billions of dollars in economic benefits.\n\nSenator Rob Portman, a Republican of Ohio, rejected the proposed spending cut for the Great Lakes program.\n\n\"I have long championed this program, and I'm committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie,\" he said in a statement, referring to the Great Lake that forms his state's northern border.\n\nWithout specifically addressing the clean-up program cuts, White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the administration's proposed 31 percent reduction in EPA spending reflected the president's view that a big shift was needed in government policies on the environment.\n\n\"You can expect reductions in the EPA that don't line up with the president's view on things like global warming and alternative energies,\" Mulvaney told reporters during a briefing on the budget plan, which would slash the EPA budget by $2.6 billion. Trump has called climate change \"a hoax.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about lawmakers' criticism of the programs' elimination.\n\nTrump's proposal would eliminate $73 million a year that six states and the District of Columbia receive to clean up the Chesapeake, the largest U.S. estuary. The bay is slowly recovering under a federal-state plan to reduce inflows of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediments from farms and urban development.\n\nAlso on the block is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has disbursed about $300 million a year to help eight states in the region recover industrial sites in harbors, block invasive species like the Asian carp and stem fertilizer run-off from farmland.\n\nTrump's budget proposal, released on Thursday, says states and local governments should shoulder the funding burden for such projects, while the EPA focuses on top national priorities.\n\nSenator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat whose state of Michigan borders four of the five Great Lakes, in a statement called the proposed cuts \"outrageous.\" The clean-up program, she said, \"has always received bipartisan support and continues to be absolutely critical to protecting our Great Lakes.\"\n\nA Brookings Institution study last year found that carrying out the Great Lakes clean-up plan would generate $80 billion to $100 billion in economic benefits, including tourism, increased property values and reduced costs to local governments.\n\nPortman and Stabenow were among 11 senators who sent a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt before the proposed budget came out. The lawmakers urged him to keep Great Lakes spending intact. Another 17 lawmakers sent a similar letter to Trump about the Chesapeake Bay program.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, called the planned cuts short-sighted because the Chesapeake Bay generated millions of dollars in revenue each year and supported thousands of fishery and tourism jobs.\n\n\"I will be working with all my colleagues from the region to urge congressional appropriators to reject the President\u2019s request and ensure we don\u2019t endanger the years of progress that have been made in restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat of Maryland, also said the spending cuts would damage the environment and threaten jobs that depend on a healthy Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.\n\nRepresentative Andy Harris, the sole Republican in Maryland's congressional delegation, defended the budget proposal.

The Trump administration had hinted it would be on the thin side of skinny.\n\n\"It could be emaciated,\" Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan budget reform advocacy group, said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\n\"At some point, you've got to put your cards on the table, and show some numbers,\" Bixby said.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there were too few details to fully understand the larger choices ahead: \"It is impossible to see the big picture when you only have a few pieces of the puzzle.\"\n\nKenneth Baer, a former associate director in Obama's Office of Management and Budget, said an overly skinny budget would make it hard to interpret how the Trump administration would spend taxpayers' money.\n\n\"It's sort of like building a house, but only putting up the front door,\" Baer said.\n\n(Click here for a graphic on 'Winners and losers in Trump's budget')\n\n(Editing by Paul Tait and Bernadette Baum)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-skinny-idUSKBN16N153"}, {"title": "Trump plans 28 percent cut in budget for diplomacy, foreign aid", "text": "WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's proposed 28 percent budget cut for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid next year would preserve $3.1 billion in security aid to Israel but reduce funding for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs.\n\nThe budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 is a first shot in a battle with Congress - which controls the government purse strings - that will play out over months and may yield spending far beyond Trump's requests.\n\nCongress, controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, may reject some or many of the proposed cuts to the U.S. State Department and Agency for International Development (USAID) budgets for maintaining America's diplomatic corps, fighting poverty, promoting human rights and improving health abroad.\n\nThe White House is proposing a combined $25.6 billion budget for the State Department and USAID, a 28 percent reduction from current spending, according to documents the White House provided on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a 'hard power' budget. It is not a 'soft power' budget,\" Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, told reporters, referring to the president's desire to prioritize military power over the influence that can flow from development aid.\n\nIn Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson defended the cuts as a necessary correction to a \"historically high\" budget for the State Department that had grown to address conflicts abroad in which the United States was engaged as well as disaster aid. Tillerson said there would be a \"comprehensive examination\" of how the State Department's programs are executed and how the department is structured.\n\nTrump's budget proposes spending $54 billion more on military spending and sinking more money into deporting illegal immigrants.\n\n'KEEPING AMERICA SAFE'\n\nSenator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was deeply disappointed and dismayed at Trump\u2019s proposal to slash foreign affairs spending.\n\nDavid Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said the roughly one-third cut in foreign aid endangered U.S. values and interests abroad.\n\n\"What\u2019s more, the U.S. foreign assistance budget makes up a mere 1 percent of the federal budget - a tiny category of discretionary spending which saves lives and spreads goodwill around the world,\" he said.\n\nMore than 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals urged Congress in a letter last month to fully fund diplomacy and foreign aid, arguing the functions were \"critical to keeping America safe.\"\n\nThe budget also requests $12 billion in \"Overseas Contingency Operations,\" or OCO, funding for extraordinary costs, chiefly in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. No comparison was provided for the current year's OCO spending.\n\nThe White House did not provide many details in its \"skinny\" budget proposal, a precursor to a more detailed budget submission the White House has said it will produce in May.\n\nThe budget would provide $3.1 billion \"to meet the security assistance commitment to Israel ... ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats\" and maintain its military superiority over more populous Arab neighbors.\n\nIt would also \"maintain current commitments and all current patient levels on HIV/AIDS treatment\" under PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the world's largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine. The program has been credited with saving millions of lives and enjoys bipartisan support.\n\nThe budget would also meet U.S. commitments to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the documents said.\n\nLOWER U.N. FUNDING\n\nWithout giving specifics, the documents laid out areas where the White House plans to save money, including by reducing U.S. funds to the United Nations and affiliated agencies \"by setting the expectation that these organizations rein in costs and that the funding burden be shared more fairly among members.\"\n\nThe United States would cut its contribution to the U.N. budget by an unspecified amount, and the U.S. government would not pay for more than 25 percent of U.N. peacekeeping costs, the documents said.\n\nThe United States is the largest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core U.N. budget and 28.5 percent of the $7.9 billion U.N. peacekeeping budget.\n\nTrump also plans to save money by eliminating the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative, which among other things seeks to foster low-carbon economic growth, and by ceasing payments to U.N. climate change programs via the Green Climate fund.\n\nHe proposes cutting funds to multilateral development banks such as the World Bank by about $650 million over three years from the Obama administration's commitments; reducing money for the State Department's Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs; turning some foreign military aid into loans from grants; and reorganizing the State Department and USAID.\n\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols at the United Nations, Roberta Rampton, Patricia Zengerle and Yara Bayoumy in Washington and Elaine Lies in Tokyo; Editing by Leslie Adler and Howard Goller)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-state-idUSKBN16N0DQ"}, {"title": "Schaeuble says held 'friendly and constructive' talks with Mnuchin", "text": "BERLIN German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday he had a \"friendly and constructive\" discussion with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Berlin and they agreed to work together to promote sustainable global growth and prosperity.\n\n\"We found a good basis\" to work together, Schaeuble said at a joint news conference with Mnuchin but added that they would not solve all of their problems at an upcoming meeting of G20 finance ministers.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Martin and Andrea Shalal)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-g20-schaeuble-mnuchin-idUSKBN16N2LN"}, {"title": "Ryan says Trump playing constructive role on healthcare", "text": "WASHINGTON House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that President Donald Trump is playing a constructive role in new health care legislation and helping bridge differences among congressional Republicans.\n\n\"This president is getting deeply involved,\" Ryan said at a news briefing. \"He is helping bridge gaps in our conference.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nTOKYO The escalating threat from North Korea's nuclear program shows a clear need for a \"new approach,\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, although he did not say what the Trump administration planned.\n\nIt was the first time that Tillerson, who was speaking at a joint news conference in Tokyo after talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, had taken questions from the media since taking office in early February.\n\nTwo decades of diplomatic and other efforts, including U.S. aid for North Korea, had failed to achieve the goal of denuclearizing Pyongyang, said Tillerson, a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience, at the start of his first trip to Asia as secretary of state.\n\n\"So we have 20 years of failed approach,\" Tillerson said. \"That includes a period where the United States has provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway.\"\n\n\"In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required. Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,\" he said.\n\nA Japanese foreign ministry official said U.S. officials had discussed potential new approaches regarding North Korea, but he declined to elaborate.\n\nAs Tillerson presses the Chinese to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, he is expected to tell them the United States intends to increase missile defense in the region, despite Beijing's strong opposition, a U.S. official told Reuters in Washington.\n\nAn advanced U.S. anti-missile system is being installed in South Korea, and the official said the Trump administration wants to discuss similar improvements with Japan.\n\nTillerson visits South Korea and China later in the week.\n\nTillerson is also likely to raise the prospects for imposing \"secondary sanctions\" on Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It is among the options being considered in a full review of North Korea policy expected to be completed by late March or early April, the official said.State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Wednesday Tillerson will have \"substantive, hard\" talks on next steps in dealing with North Korea but that his visit was not likely to produce an immediate specific response.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeated Foreign Minister Wang Yi's proposal last week that North Korea should stop its nuclear and missile tests and South Korea and the United States should stop joint military drills and seek talks instead.\n\n\"We welcome all parties, including the United States, to come up with their own proposals,\" Hua told a daily news briefing. \"As long as these proposals are conducive to ameliorating the present tense situation on the Korean peninsula and are beneficial to maintaining regional peace and stability ... China will have an open attitude.\"\n\nTillerson made it clear he expected China, North Korea's sole major ally, to do more.\n\n\"We will be having discussions with China as to further actions we believe they might consider taking that would be helpful to bringing North Korea to a different attitude about its future need for nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\nSEEKING CLUES\n\nTillerson's comments in Japan were eagerly watched by international observers for indications as to what they meant for the Trump administration's foreign policy.\n\nJapan is seeking clues to Washington's policies both on North Korea and China's increasing military and economic clout while hoping to steer clear of trade rows.\n\nTillerson also held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and had dinner with Kishida.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump made it a hallmark of his campaign to call on allies, including Japan, to pay more for hosting U.S. forces and other elements of American protection.\n\nTillerson issued a far gentler message at the conference, underscoring the \"long-standing\" U.S.-Japanese alliance.\n\n\"While the security environment in this region can be challenging, the United States is committed to strengthening our role, and we welcome an increased Japanese commitment to their roles and responsibilities in our alliance,\" he said.\n\nTillerson is the second member of Trump's cabinet to visit Japan. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited last month, and Vice President Mike Pence is due in April, underscoring U.S. concerns surrounding North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. Abe was the first foreign leader who met Trump after his November election win.\n\nNorth Korea last week launched four ballistic missiles, the latest in a series, and is developing nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions.\n\nWashington has said all options, including military, are on the table in its review of policies toward North Korea. In the final months of the Obama administration, U.S. officials warned it would blacklist Chinese companies and banks that do illicit business with North Korea if Beijing failed to enforce U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nThe United States has begun deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in South Korea, a move China objects to strongly because it sees the system's radar as a threat to its security.\n\nPak Myong Ho, a North Korean embassy official speaking in Beijing on Thursday, said the deployment \"will destroy the balance in Northeast Asia and the Pacific region.\"\n\n\"The radar is not aimed at just us,\" Pak said. \"It is also aiming for China and Russia.\"\n\nChina's assertiveness in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial row with Japan, and the South China Sea, where it has disputes with the Philippines and several other Southeast Asian nations, were also on the agenda.\n\n(Additional reporting by Christine Kim in Seoul, Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom in Washington and Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Writing by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Nick Macfie and James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tillerson-asia-japan-idUSKBN16M3AN"}, {"title": "Trump picks Boeing executive Shanahan to become Pentagon's No.2", "text": "Boeing's Pat Shanahan speaks to thousands of employees and guests, as a curtain is raised to unveil the 747-8 jumbo passenger at the company's Everett, Washington commercial airplane manufacturing facility, February 13, 2011.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nDETROIT/WASHINGTON President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration, handing a victory to auto industry executives and provoking criticism from Democrats and environmental groups.\n\nIn a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards, Trump told an audience of cheering union workers, he would \"ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories,\" and promised he would encourage growth in the U.S. auto sector.\n\n\"The assault on the American auto industry is over,\" Trump said, standing in front of a banner that read \"Buy American-Hire American.\"\n\nTrump added that the White House is \"setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production.\"\n\nThe backdrop and message underscored Trump's efforts to lock down support in industrial states such as Michigan that put him in the White House. Trump spoke at the site of the former Willow Run bomber factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which won fame for building an operational B-24 heavy bomber every 59 minutes during World War Two. Now, the site is being redeveloped as a testing ground for autonomous vehicles.\n\nAt a roundtable with industry leaders Trump made clear he expected automakers to hire more Americans in return, a theme that dominated his election campaign.\n\n\"We're going to do some wonderful work with you, but you're going to have to help us with jobs,\" he said.\n\nTrump's event was attended by around 1,000 people, including automotive executives, United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams - who sat next to Trump - and workers from Detroit's \"Big Three\" automakers: General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N). Automakers lined up examples of vehicles they build in the United States for the president to see.\n\nAuto industry executives have said they are hopeful the Trump administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers.\n\nReopening the fuel efficiency rules put in place by Democratic President Barack Obama days before he left office is one of the top items on the industry's agenda. Automakers, through their lobbying groups, have said the Obama rules were too expensive and could cost American jobs.\n\n\"These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,\" said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nAfter one participant in Wednesday's meetings mentioned environmental concerns, Trump said he agreed but did not want an \"extra thimbleful of fuel\" to get in the way of growth.\n\nIn a meeting with top auto executives from U.S. and foreign automakers, Trump said the government needs to get out of the way of the auto industry building vehicles, a person who attended the meeting said.\n\nAutomakers are wary of being seen as out of touch with environmental concerns, or unwilling to invest in new technology. Ford, for example, used its Twitter account on Wednesday to highlight previously announced commitments to develop electric vehicles.\n\nIt could take a year for the review process to play out, and Wednesday's event was effectively a starting gun for intense lobbying efforts over how government policy will drive technology investment decisions in the auto sector.\n\nCritics like Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Trump's move could hurt consumers.\n\n\"Filling up their cars and trucks is the energy bill Americans pay most often, but President Trump's roll-back of fuel economy emissions standards means families will end up paying more at the pump,\" Markey added.\n\nThe president is not seeking to revoke California's authority to set vehicle efficiency rules even stricter than federal rules, including mandated sales of electric vehicles, as part of this move, a White House official said. The official did not rule out seeking to withdraw California's authority in the future. Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, would not commit during his Senate confirmation hearing to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules.\n\nA group of 10 state attorneys general led by California and New York said on Wednesday they would fight attempts to weaken the rules.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s attorney general late Tuesday filed legal papers in a federal court defending the Obama administration\u2019s decision to finalize the determination in January.\n\nBarclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that he expects the Trump administration review will lead to reductions in planned hikes in fuel efficiency standards after 2021.\n\nThe Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2012, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, although the real-world mileage figures would be lower.\n\n'THOUGHTFUL AND COORDINATED'\n\nAutomotive industry executives and lobbying groups were quick to praise the administration's announcement.\n\n\"The Trump administration has created an opportunity for decision-makers to reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data,\" said Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group.\n\nAutomakers have signaled they want the government to give manufacturers more credit toward achieving fuel efficiency targets for technologies such as \"stop-start\" systems that shut down a car\u2019s engine at a traffic light.\n\nRegulators should also look at whether ride hailing and vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems designed to prevent accidents and alleviate road congestion could be counted toward the industry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions goals, the automaker group proposed in comments to the EPA last year. The group represents a dozen automakers, including GM, Ford and FCA.\n\nUnder the 2012 agreement with the industry, the EPA was given until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a \"midterm review,\" but the agency moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's environmental legacy.\n\nAn EPA analysis indicated that compared with previous rules, the 2025 standards would result in savings of between $1,460 and $1,620 over the lifetime of a vehicle and payback for new technology required to meet the new standards of around five years.\n\nThe Obama administration said the rules would cost the auto industry $200 billion over 13 years, but save motorists $1.7 trillion over the life of the vehicles.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall, Emily Stephenson and Susan Heavey; Writing by Will Dunham; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-idUSKBN16M2C5"}, {"title": "Japan agrees with U.S. that North Korea's weapons 'not permissible'", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R) meets with Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida before their meeting at the foreign ministry's Iikura guest house in Tokyo, Japan, March 16, 2017.

REUTERS/Lockheed Martin/Darin Russell/Handout\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump will propose beefing up military spending and slashing domestic programs and foreign aid in his fiscal year 2018 budget to be released on Thursday.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nDEFENSE\n\nThe budget calls for an increase of $52 billion for the Defense Department above the 2017 base budget of about $522 billion, enacted under the Obama administration. There is an additional $2 billion increase in defense spending in other departments, including Energy and State.\n\nThat is still less than some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress have called for, including the heads of the committees in the Senate and House of Representatives that oversee the U.S. military. But at a time of broad cuts elsewhere in the budget, the Pentagon is unlikely to complain.\n\nThe plan earmarks the new funds to accelerate the fight against Islamic State militants, reverse Army troop reductions, build more ships for the Navy and ramp up the Air Force \u2013 including by purchasing additional F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).\n\nHOMELAND SECURITY\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8 percent increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump wants Congress to shell out $1.5 billion for his promised border wall with Mexico in the current fiscal year - enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it - and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018.\n\nFOREIGN AID\n\nThe combined budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, would fall by 28 percent, with funding cuts for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. The plan preserves $3.1 billion in security aid to Israel.\n\nThe budget also requests $12 billion in so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funding for extraordinary costs, chiefly in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. No comparison was provided for the current year's OCO spending.\n\nCurrent commitments on HIV/AIDS treatment under PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, will be maintained. PEPFAR is the world's largest provider of AIDS-fighting medicine and enjoys bipartisan support.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's budget would be cut by 31 percent, eliminating its climate change programs and trimming back core initiatives aimed at protecting air and water quality.\n\nThe proposal would eliminate 3,200 EPA employees, or 19 percent of the current workforce, and effectively erase former Democratic President Barack Obama's initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agency's signature Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nHealthcare companies such as drug makers and device makers will pay more than twice as much in 2018 to have their medical products reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration under the proposed budget.\n\nThe proposal budgets over $2 billion in fees to be collected from industry, twice as much in 2017.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nOversight of air traffic control would move from the federal government to an independent group under the proposals, which include a 13 percent cut for the Department of Transportation's discretionary budget.\n\nThe plan also calls for cutting the U.S. space agency NASA budget by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion.\n\nENERGY\n\nThe budget for the Department of Energy would include $120 million to restart licensing for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Nevada, a project that has been stalled for years because of lawsuits and local opposition.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nThe Agriculture Department's discretionary spending would be cut to $17.9 billion, a 21 percent drop from the temporary 2017 funding levels approved by Congress late last year.

There also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private-company board and limit access to airports by business jets.\n\nThe budget would eliminate $175 million in annual funding for the Essential Air Service, a program to support commercial air service to rural airports and end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service.\n\nAmtrak would then \"focus on better managing\" state-supported lines and service in the busy Northeast corridor, the budget document said.\n\nThe Trump budget would also eliminate the Obama administration's \"TIGER\" grant program, saving $499 million. That program has been used to fund a variety of transportation projects, including high-speed and intracity rail, highway construction and transit bus systems.\n\nThe budget calls for cutting the budget of U.S. space agency NASA by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion. The budget proposes cancelling the multi-billion-dollar Asteroid Redirect Mission, but funds development of the Orion crew vehicle and Space Launch System.\n\nThe budget calls for expanding public private partnerships. NASA has partnerships with Space Exploration Technologies and other companies.\n\nThe budget funds a mission to fly by Jupiter moon Europa, but cancels a multi-billion mission to land on the moon. It would also fund a Mars rover mission in 2020.\n\nThe FAA is spending billions to implement \"NextGen,\" a system that would utilize satellites to monitor aircraft instead of radar and make other changes and has faced implementation challenges.\n\nThe FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on NextGen over the past seven years, which \"has resulted in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and the airlines to date, and is expected to yield more than $160 billion in benefits through 2030.\"\n\nLast month, Trump criticized spending on NextGen, saying the system was \"totally out of whack,\" over budget and behind schedule.\n\nThe FAA handles more than 50,000 flights a day and more than 700 million passengers each year. It spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has about 28,000 air traffic control personnel.\n\nSince 1987, several countries have moved responsibility for air traffic control from national civil aviation authorities to independent self-financed providers.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said in a 2016 report that the United States \"is generally considered to have the busiest, most complex and safest ATC system in the world.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-transportation-idUSKBN16N0DI"}, {"title": "FDA fees for product review would more than double under Trump budget", "text": "NEW YORK The cost to healthcare companies for U.S. regulatory review of their products, including drugs and medical devices, would more than double under the Trump administration's proposed 2018 budget.\n\nFor 2018, the Trump administration has budgeted over $2 billion in fees to be collected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from industry, twice as much as in 2017, according to budget documents released on Thursday.\n\nCiting a constrained budget environment, the proposed budget said industries that benefit from the FDA's approval \"can and should pay for their share.\"\n\nIn return, the budget said it also offered measures that would help speed up the approval process for new drugs and other products.\n\nThe FDA has been criticized by lawmakers for not being quick enough at approving drugs, and President Donald Trump told Congress earlier this year that he aimed to speed up the approval of drugs.\n\nThe FDA has been charging companies to review their products since 1992.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump used his barnstorming strategy on Wednesday to try to build momentum for his first legislative initiative, a healthcare overhaul, by holding a massive rally in Nashville, Tennessee, reminiscent of his campaign events.\n\nBack on Capitol Hill, Republican leaders negotiated behind closed doors, held media conferences and gave cable-news interviews as they tried to push forward their plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.\n\nAfter Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the new plan last week, fault lines appeared within the party as some conservatives said it did not go far enough and others rejected it entirely.\n\nTrump used campaign-like language in his Wednesday night speech, pledging \"to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard presidential plane Air Force One after the rally, Trump expressed optimism about his plan's chances in Congress.\n\n\"We're going to come up with something. We always do,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans control both Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade, but the overhaul still faces political battles to be fought by a president new to governing.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters before the rally the Trump administration had been in talks with Ryan and congressional leaders and was flooding the media with interviews with administration officials to help advance the plan.\n\nRyan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, also continued to champion the legislation, saying on cable news he was open to making \"improvements and refinements,\" but also adding \"the major components are staying intact.\"\n\nHe told a news conference later in the evening the House would hold votes on repealing and replacing Obamacare but refused to provide a timetable.\n\nRELUCTANT CONSERVATIVES\n\nTwo House committees approved the bill's provisions with no changes last week. The Budget Committee will try on Thursday to unify the plan into a single bill for consideration on the House floor. Republicans cannot afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass. Three committee Republicans are members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nSigns emerged on Wednesday that the White House was winning over reluctant conservatives who initially questioned the legislation on the grounds that it too closely resembled Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe administration indicated it was open to revisiting the plan's treatment of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, during a meeting with a conservative wing of the party.\n\nSpecifically, conservatives want Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid to end sooner than proposed in the Ryan plan, and want to introduce Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults without children.\n\nState governments run Medicaid with reimbursements from the federal government. Obamacare expanded its eligibility and increased funding for it, which enabled about 10 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical insurance.\n\nVice President Mike Pence advocated for the plan earlier on Wednesday behind closed doors with the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House conservatives.\n\nRepublican Representative Phil Roe said after the Pence meeting the bill would probably be changed to move up the end of the Medicaid expansion by one year, to 2019.\n\nThe conservative group's members were \"very close to signing off\" on the legislation, its leader, Representative Mark Walker, told reporters.\n\nSpeaking on CNN, Ryan mentioned \"giving states better chances at more flexibility with Medicaid,\" but provided no details.\n\nJust as the party's conservatives began expressing optimism about the proposal's fortunes, Republican moderates raised concerns that tax credits currently in the bill intended to help people buy health insurance were not sufficient.\n\nRepresentative Charlie Dent, following a meeting of moderate Republicans with Pence, told reporters that speeding up the termination of the Medicaid expansion was a \"non-starter.\"\n\n\"MORTALLY WOUNDED\"\n\nSenate Republicans have also voiced rising unease.\n\n\"As written, the House bill would not pass the Senate. But I believe we can fix it,\" Senator Ted Cruz told reporters.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham told NBC's \"Today\" show: \"It is mortally wounded.\"\n\nThe conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks held a rally amid snow flurries and a frigid wind outside the Capitol, where several House and Senate Republicans, including Cruz and Senator Rand Paul, voiced dissatisfaction with the bill.\n\nPaul later told reporters: \"The White House has been much more open to negotiation on this\" than House leaders.\n\nA libertarian, Paul posted an op-ed on the Breitbart News website later on Wednesday calling Ryan's plan \"Obamacare Lite\" and suggesting smashing it to \"smithereens.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released data showing enrollment in the individual insurance plans created under Obamacare has declined to 12.2 million Americans.\n\nEnrollment in these individual insurance plans was down by about 500,000 people from 2016 by the end of January, it said. It is about 1.6 million people short of Obama's goal for 2017 sign-ups, the government said.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Morgan, Lewis Krauskopf, Caroline Humer, Ayesha Rascoe, Eric Beech, Richard Cowan; Writing by Will Dunham and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Leslie Adler and Paul Tait)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16L1VF"}, {"title": "Apple, Google, Facebook skip legal challenge to new travel ban", "text": "FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on the side of a tour bus in New York's financial district July 28, 2015.

REUTERS/Hugh Gentry\n\nHONOLULU/NEW YORK Just hours before President Donald Trump's revised travel ban was set to go into effect, a U.S. federal judge in Hawaii on Wednesday issued an emergency halt to the order's implementation.\n\nThe action was the latest legal blow to the administration's efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries, which the President has said is needed for national security. Trump lashed out at the judge's ruling, saying it \"makes us look weak.\"\n\nTrump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February.\n\nU.S. District Judge Derrick Watson put an emergency stop to the new order in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii, which argued that the order discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nJudge Watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention Islam by name, \"a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.\" Watson was appointed to the bench by former Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Nashville, Trump called his revised executive order a \"watered-down version\" of his first. \"I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called the judge's block \"unprecedented judicial overreach\" and said he will take the case \"as far as it needs to go,\" including to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Department of Justice called the ruling \"flawed both in reasoning and in scope,\" adding that the president has broad authority in national security matters. \"The Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts,\" it said a statement.\n\nThe nation's highest court is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives with Trump's pick - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation.\n\nPaul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said the ban was needed to improve vetting of people entering the United States in order to prevent attacks and said he had no doubt that it would be upheld by higher courts.\n\nREBUKE\n\nWatson's order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. He set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended.\n\nTrump's first travel order was more sweeping than the second revised order. Like the current one, it barred citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, but it also included Iraq, which was subsequently taken off the list.\n\nRefugees were blocked from entering the country for 120 days in both orders, but an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria was dropped in the new one.\n\nThe revised ban also excluded legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. It provided a series of waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the United States.\n\nHawaii and other opponents of the ban claimed that the motivation behind it was Trump's campaign promise of \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\n\nThe government, in its court filings cautioned the court against looking for secret motives in the executive order and against performing \"judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\u2019s heart of heart.\"\n\nWatson said he did not need to do that, because evidence of motive could be found in the president's public statements. He said he did not give credence to the government's argument that the order was not anti-Muslim because it targeted only a small percentage of Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,\" the judge wrote.\n\nSEVERAL CASES\n\nThe case was one of several moving through U.S. courts on Wednesday that were brought by states' attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\nIn Maryland, refugee resettlement agencies represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center argued in court for a restraining order.\n\nIn Washington state, a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant visas asked U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle - who suspended the first ban - to stop the new order.

Last year they refused to consider Democratic former president Barack Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nTrump's fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48, but Schumer repeated his view that Gorsuch would need to win 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation. Democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if Gorsuch's supporters cannot muster 60 votes, although Republicans could change the Senate rules.\n\n\"If a nominee can\u2019t get 60 votes, you don\u2019t change the rules,\" Schumer said. \"You change the nominee.\"\n\nAmong the plaintiffs who spoke out was truck driver Alphonse Maddin, who was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at the side of a road after the brakes froze.

Christopher Giancarlo, who was nominated by President Donald Trump as permanent chairman late Tuesday, said it was time for the CFTC to \"reinterpret its regulatory mission\" by focusing on fostering economic growth, enhancing U.S. markets, and \"right-sizing\" its regulatory footprint.\n\nIn prepared remarks before the Futures Industry Association's annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida, he outlined plans to create a new initiative to help streamline regulation known as \"Project KISS\" and said he intends to restructure the CFTC's market surveillance branch in an effort to strengthen how the agency polices the marketplace.\n\nThat unit, in charge of searching for manipulation and other abuses, is currently housed in the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight. Giancarlo said it would be relocated inside the agency's enforcement division to bolster how the CFTC polices the marketplace.\n\nA new \"chief market intelligence officer\" position will also be created, he said, to help oversee a new branch that will be tasked with keeping pace with new trends and technology.\n\nDODD-FRANK CRITICISM\n\nGiancarlo often has been highly critical of the way the CFTC has implemented rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.\n\nIn his speech, he pledged to fix what he called \"flawed swaps trading rules\" which he blamed for driving business away from the United States, and added that the he hopes to work more effectively with international regulators while still looking out for American interests.\n\nHe also promised to soon release the results of a review launched in January into the financial technology or fintech sector that seeks to understand what the CFTC's role should be in regulating the sector.\n\nGiancarlo, a Republican, has been acting chairman of the CFTC since Jan. 20 and first became a commissioner of the agency in 2014.\n\nThroughout his tenure, he has been critical of the way the CFTC has implemented many of the new rules for over-the-counter derivatives that were mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.\n\nGoing forward, he promised to take a much more active role in his position as a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a body of regulators created by the Dodd-Frank law that reviews large financial firms to determine whether their collapse could pose broad systemic risks.\n\nOnce designated, a company faces an extra level of regulations and oversight.\n\nGiancarlo accused the FSOC of failing to weigh the cumulative effect of regulations, particularly stricter bank capital standards which he said are harming market-making and economic growth.\n\n\"The CFTC must use its authority and influence to address the question of whether the amount of capital that bank regulators have caused financial institutions to take out of trading markets is at all calibrated to the amount of capital needed to be kept in global markets,\" he said.\n\nHis new \"Project KISS\" initiative, which stands for \"Keep it Simple Stupid,\" represents an effort to follow the guidelines set out last month in an executive order by President Donald Trump which calls on agencies to conduct regulatory reviews.\n\nAs an independent agency, the CFTC is not bound by the order. Nevertheless, Giancarlo stressed the need to follow it, saying the project will entail a review \"to make them simpler, less burdensome and less costly.\"\n\nAny efforts to make changes to rules, however, could take time.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.\n\nThe sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.\n\nThe accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.\n\nThe sources did not name the companies contacted.\n\nOne of the sources said the companies were \"publicly traded fossil fuel companies,\" and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.\n\nA White House official declined to comment.\n\nTrump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to \"cancel the Paris Climate Agreement\" within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.\n\nSince being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.\n\nOfficials for Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.\n\nBut several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal.\n\nOIL COMPANY SUPPORT\n\nExxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an \u201ceffective framework\u201d for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon\u2019s own work to cut its carbon emissions.\n\nIn comments on Exxon\u2019s website, Woods wrote: \u201cI believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it\u2019s going to take all of us \u2013 business, governments and consumers \u2013 to make meaningful progress.\u201d\n\nRex Tillerson, Exxon\u2019s former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be \"better served by being at that table\" and remaining a party to climate change negotiations.\n\nConoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.\n\nBenjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: \"With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement.\"\n\nJ. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump\u2019s anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S.\n\n\"The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate,\u201d he said.\n\nGlobal oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Gary McWilliams in Houston; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Chris Reese)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-climatechange-idUSKBN16M2CB"}, {"title": "Key U.S. Senate committee leaders say Russia sanctions must remain", "text": "Chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Mike Crapo (R-ID) hearing listens to testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen on the \u201cSemiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\u201d on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 14, 2017.

The White House has said the deal was not in the best interest of the United States.\n\nIran denies interference in Arab countries.\n\nPRAISE FOR TRUMP\n\nThe meeting was the first since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration with the prince, who is leading the kingdom's efforts to revive state finances by diversifying the economy away from a reliance on falling crude oil revenues.\n\nUnder the plan, which seeks to promote the private sector and make state-owned companies more efficient, Riyadh plans to sell up to 5 percent of state oil giant Saudi Aramco in what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering.\n\nThe two leaders, who discussed opportunities for U.S. companies to invest in Saudi Arabia, kicked off their talks in the Oval Office posing for a picture in front of journalists.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon were also present at the Oval Office meeting with Prince Mohammed.\n\nThe meeting also appeared to illustrate support for some of the most contentious issues that Trump has faced since taking office on Jan. 20.\n\nOn a travel ban against six Muslim-majority countries, the adviser said Prince Mohammed did not regard it as one that was aimed at \"Muslim countries or Islam\".\n\nEarlier this month Trump signed a revised executive order on banning citizens from Yemen, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Libya from traveling to the United States but removed Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the court\n\nTrump's travel ban has come under criticism for targeting citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. The senior adviser said Prince Mohammed \"expressed his satisfaction after the meeting on the positive position and clarifications he heard from President Trump on his views on Islam\".\n\nThe senior adviser said the leaders discussed the \"successful Saudi experience of setting up a border protection system\" on the Saudi-Iraq border which has prevented smuggling.\n\nTrump has vowed to start work quickly on the barrier along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border to prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from crossing to the north.\n\nTRUMP REVIEWING PGM SALE\n\nObama late last year suspended the sale of U.S.-made precision-guidance munitions to the Saudis, a reaction to thousands of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air strikes in Yemen.\n\nU.S. officials said Trump was considering ending that ban and approving the sale of guidance systems made by Raytheon Co. The State Department has approved the move, which awaits a final White House decision, the officials said.\n\nA source close to the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a main topic of the meeting would be Saudi investment in the United States, which could help the U.S. president fulfill his promises of job creation.\n\n\"It's the creation of jobs through investments - President Trump wants results and statistics matter for him,\" said Ingrid Naranjo, an expert in U.S.-Saudi relations. \"It makes a lot of sense for the diversification strategy of Saudi to invest abroad and especially in the U.S.\"\n\nGregory Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University, said that while Saudi Arabia might find the \u201catmospherics\u201d of its relations with Trump better than those with Obama, it might find less change than it hopes on key issues.\n\nFor example, he said, Trump is unlikely to mount a major, costly effort to counter Iranian influence in Iraq, or to launch a full-scale campaign to oust Syrian President Bashar al Assad, as Riyadh might wish.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to find rhetorically that the new administration says things and uses language they like more,\u201d said Gause. \u201cBut I think on the ground, we\u2019re not going to see an enormous difference.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Yara Bayoumy, Jeff Mason and Warren Strobel in Washington and Reem Shamseddine in Saudi Arabia; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Peter Cooney and Michael Perry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-idUSKBN16L2CT"}, {"title": "Trump to nominate Goldman Sachs' Donovan as deputy Treasury secretary", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker James Donovan as deputy Treasury secretary, the White House said on Tuesday, adding another alumnus of the Wall Street investment bank to his administration.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn are also former Goldman executives who occupy senior economic posts within the administration.\n\nDonovan's work at the bank as a managing director has included work on corporate strategy, investment banking and investment management, the White House said in a statement.\n\nHe is expected to work on the Trump administration's domestic policy agenda at Treasury.\n\nThe White House also named David Malpass, a former official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

Throughout his tenure as a CFTC commissioner, Giancarlo has been critical of the way the agency has implemented many of the new rules required by Dodd-Frank.\n\nHe issued a white paper in 2015, for instance, which accused the CFTC's regulatory framework of driving global traders away from the United States, fragmenting the marketplace and increasing liquidity risk.\n\nHe has dissented on a number of other major policy areas, including a proposal requiring automated traders to hand over sensitive code without a subpoena - something Giancarlo said \"would strip owners of intellectual property of due process of law.\"\n\nAs chairman, Giancarlo is likely to focus his energy on scaling back rules that he believes are overly burdensome to help boost economic growth - a vision that is also shared by Jay Clayton, Trump's pick to head the CFTC's sister regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn a speech Monday before the Institute of International Bankers, Giancarlo criticized those who have dwelled heavily on preventing a repeat of the financial crisis, saying the impact has been to \"sideline capital from productive uses.\"\n\nIf confirmed as chairman, however, Giancarlo could face some initial challenges getting his agenda adopted.\n\nCurrently, the five-member panel is down to two commissioners - Giancarlo and Sharon Bowen, a Democrat. If the two disagree on a decision, the measure cannot pass.\n\nGiancarlo acknowledged this challenge in his speech Monday, saying the agency cannot proceed on a controversial position limits rule without a full commission.\n\nTrump has not yet nominated anyone for the remaining three positions.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

REUTERS/Keith Bedford\n\nNEW YORK A group advising U.S. President Donald Trump on infrastructure has proposed an arbitration-style pilot program to slash the current 10 years it often takes to break ground on projects, without short-changing environmental standards.\n\nThe group, led by billionaire New York real estate developers Richard LeFrak and Steve Roth, made the suggestion to Trump and others in the White House last week, LeFrak told Reuters on Monday.\n\nBuilders, unions and others often rue a permitting processes that can last a decade or more \u2013 a potential snag in Trump\u2019s plan to launch a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure building program to create jobs and bolster the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nLeFrak said the advisory council is looking at a pilot program comparable to the arbitration process used in bankruptcy court to speed up proposals, reduce red tape and halt litigation that can tie up infrastructure projects in court for years.\n\n\u201cSomebody in authority would make the decisions, all the mitigation that should be coming out of it, whether it\u2019s environmental mitigation, other mitigation, gets decided at that moment and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a proposal. We\u2019re asking them to try it.\u201d\n\nThe council is not empowered to pick projects or make decisions about how to streamline the project permitting process for projects, he said. Any pilot program would be up to state and federal officials and Congress, he said.\n\nLeFrak added that the proposal would not allow projects for bridges, roads or airports to side-step regulations, such as environmental rules. The idea would be to hammer out differences and objections faster in an arbitration-like setting so that projects could get underway in less time.\n\nAustralia, Canada and Germany typically take two years to approve infrastructure projects compared with 10 years in the United States, he said.\n\nA shortened review process could leave projects open to worries from environmentalists and others that an expedited permitting system could short-change environmental protections.\n\nEnvironmental groups are skeptical of Trump's promise to overhaul government regulations without jeopardizing America's water and air quality. When Trump unveils his budget on Thursday, he is expected to slash the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 25 percent.\n\nThe Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups as well as the office of House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi were not available for comment.\n\nGAS TAX HIKE\n\nPermitting and other regulatory hurdles can delay projects for years, a potential liability for a program that seeks to put money \u2013 and people \u2013 to work immediately.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be some way without abrogating anybody\u2019s rights to get all this on the table much more quickly,\u201d said LeFrak, who is chairman and chief executive of the LeFrak Organization, a leading developer and property owner in the New York metro area and South Florida.\n\nLeFrak pointed to the replacement within 14 months of a bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007 killing 13 people as an example of how projects can get done without compromising standards.\n\nLeFrak also said the committee wants to use private funds to soak up cost overruns and keep projects maintained after completion.\n\nHe suggested, as well, one possible solution to the key question of how to pay for Trump\u2019s infrastructure program: a higher federal gas tax.\n\nIf not, funding will have to come from general tax revenue, he said. Local and state government pay for about 70 percent of infrastructure projects in the United States, with the remainder funded by the federal government.\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers last week recommended an 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline be raised at least to 25 cents per gallon to fill a funding deficit for infrastructure it said was $2 trillion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying somebody\u2019s going to have pay for it. It doesn\u2019t come for free,\u201d LeFrak said. \u201cI wish I was powerful enough to impose a gas tax, but I\u2019m not.\"\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash and Luciana Lopez; Editing by Daniel Bases and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-infrastructure-idUSKBN16L2VE"}, {"title": "Trump's USTR nominee pledges tough enforcement of U.S. trade laws", "text": "Robert Lighthizer testifies before a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be U.S. trade representative on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 14, 2017.

As a veteran trade lawyer in more recent years, he pursued dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against imports of steel and other products.\n\nLighthizer said he would seek to increase trade while making it \"freer and fairer\" to the benefit of U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.\n\nAn outspoken critic of China, Lighthizer said Beijing's industrial policies have supported vast amounts of \"uneconomic\" production capacity that would not survive without state support. He said this was particularly true in the steel and aluminum sectors, leading to the dumping of products into U.S. markets.\n\nLighthizer told senators that he would engage with China in multilateral forums to reduce that capacity, but said trade enforcement actions may be more effective by raising the costs of keeping such factories alive.\n\n\"It has to be more difficult for them to maintain non-economic capacity, and that means enforcing our trade laws, and it means encouraging other countries where they can ship their products to enforce their trade laws.\"\n\nLighthizer said he believes China was a \"substantial currency manipulator\" in the past, but that it was unclear if Beijing was continuing to do so.\n\nThe comment was in line with more neutral statements on the subject from Trump administration officials more recently after the president threatened during his campaign to declare China a currency manipulator.\n\nLighthizer also pledged to fight for strong protections for intellectual property rights and for digital trade access.\n\nIn renegotiating the North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, he said it was important not to lose gains in agricultural exports to those countries while encouraging more production to return to the United States.\n\nRegarding Canada, he said finding a solution to a long-running trade dispute over softwood lumber would be his top priority.\n\nTrump's cabinet already is crowded with senior trade officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the director of the newly created White House National Trade Council, Peter Navarro.\n\nLighthizer said that if confirmed, he would have the USTR's full statutory powers and would play a lead role to \"sort out\" U.S. trade policy, working closely with other agencies.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-lighthizer-idUSKBN16L2EZ"}, {"title": "Trump to roll back use of climate change in policy reviews: source", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to return to Washington, after spending the weekend at the Mar-a-Lago Club, from Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. March 5, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is preparing to release a wide-ranging executive order to reduce the role that climate change plays in policy decisions, according to a Trump administration official who reviewed a draft of the order.\n\nThe move could alter how U.S. agencies weigh regulations on a broad array of industries, from drilling, coal mining and auto manufacturing to refining.\n\nThe official on Tuesday confirmed a Bloomberg News report that the executive order will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to overhaul their use of the \"social cost of carbon,\" an Obama-era policy that seeks to quantify potential economic damage from climate change for the purposes of drafting regulation.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kelly Love declined to discuss the timing of an executive order on energy. \"We have nothing to announce at this time,\" she said.\n\nUnder rules put in by place by former President Barack Obama, the current cost of carbon in policy decisions is $36 per ton, which will rise to $50 by 2030. The Trump order would direct regulators to use a \"discount rate\" that would dramatically reduce, or eliminate, that cost.\n\nDiscount rates are used to come up with a net present value of something whose benefits and costs will be distributed over time. In the case of carbon, the impact of emissions on the earth's climate can take several years to appear.\n\nUnder some scenarios referenced in the executive order, carbon could have a zero or \"negative value,\" the source said. The source said that the order may be an initial step to ultimately phasing out the carbon evaluation entirely.\n\nThe executive order could be issued as soon as this week, the source said, and may include other energy-specific measures, like a requirement for the EPA to conduct a review of regulations that could harm energy production.\n\nReuters and others have reported previously that Trump planned to target Obama-era green regulations, including a federal coal mining ban and an initiative forcing states to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe Department of Interior under Obama had issued a moratorium on coal leasing on federal land in 2015 as it sought to review the program and evaluate whether the government adequately priced the value of coal extracted from public lands on behalf of taxpayers.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan was Obama's centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide. But it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states.\n\nThe new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said last week he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated.\n\nThe Obama administration's carbon cost estimates were first issued in 2010 and have been used to analyze rules directly targeting carbon dioxide emissions, like car and truck emissions standards. They have also been used to cover rules on indirect emissions, like one to control mercury and other air pollutants from power plants.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-carbon-idUSKBN16L2R4"}, {"title": "Veteran U.S. diplomat Patterson out of running for Pentagon post", "text": "U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Anne Patterson attends a meeting on Syria with representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council (P5) at the United Nations (U.N.)

Obamacare, as President Barack Obama's signature piece of domestic policy is commonly called, expanded insurance to about 20 million Americans. (bit.ly/2mkdeYA)\n\nHours after the CBO report was released, the House Budget Committee postponed its consideration of the Republican bill to Thursday from Wednesday. Prior to the report, Republicans had been planning to vote soon on the bill in the House, where it is likely to pass, and send it to the Senate, where its outlook is uncertain.\n\nThe CBO projected that 52 million people would be uninsured by 2026 if the bill became law, compared with 28 million who would not have coverage that year if the law remained unchanged.\n\nTwo House of Representatives committees have approved the legislation to dismantle Obamacare that was unveiled by Republican leaders a week ago, but it faces opposition from not only Democrats but also medical providers including doctors and hospitals and many conservatives. The CBO report's findings could make the Republican plan a harder sell for lawmakers, particularly in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe CBO, however, said federal deficits would fall by $337 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the Republican bill.\n\nSome health policy experts and Wall Street analysts said the report was more draconian than expected, with the uninsured rate rising more quickly than foreseen. Doctors groups and patient advocates said the bill must be abandoned.\n\nThe AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for aging Americans, said Monday that the CBO analysis showed the financial burden of the Republican plan would fall \"disproportionately\" on Americans 50 to 64 years old. In a five-page letter to House members last week, the AARP has also criticized a tax cut it said would threaten the solvency of Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, cuts to Medicaid and said the bill does nothing to lower drug costs.\n\nSome Republicans worry a misfire on the Republican healthcare legislation could hobble Trump's presidency and set the stage for losses for the party in the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nThe Trump administration defended the healthcare plan, which they say will have a second and third phase that will entice consumers. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said at the White House that Trump's plan would cover more individuals at a lower cost and it was \"virtually impossible\" to envision that 14 million people would lose insurance coverage by next year.\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress said the bill could result in elderly people being kicked out of nursing homes as it simultaneously gives tax cuts for the richest Americans.\n\n\"How can they look their constituents in the eye when they say 24 million of you no longer have coverage and those of you who do have it, will have less coverage at more cost to you,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nTrump himself made no comment on the report.\n\nPREMIUMS TO RISE\n\nThe Affordable Care Act aimed to help restrain U.S. healthcare spending, which is about 17 percent of the nation's economy, but it has continued to grow faster than inflation.\n\nThe proposal would end the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and would replace Obamacare's income-based subsidies with fixed tax credits for the purchase of private insurance.\n\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on Monday said the Republican plan would benefit the wealthiest U.S. households far more than middle-income families. A family making $51,600 to $89,400 a year, including fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance, would get a tax cut averaging $300. The top 0.1 percent of earners with incomes of at least $3.9 million would get a tax cut of about $207,000, the study said.\n\nThe CBO estimated that insurance premiums would rise 15 percent to 20 percent in both 2018 and 2019 because fewer healthy people would sign up after the repeal of the Obamacare penalty for declining to obtain insurance. But it said the hikes would be offset after 2020 by a $100 billion fund allocated to states in the bill and deregulation in the insurance market.\n\nBy 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower than the estimates under current law, in part because insurers will be able to offer plans that cover a lower share of healthcare costs.\n\nWhile the federal government would lose revenues through the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates\u2019 tax penalties, CBO said the loss would be surpassed by savings on insurance subsidies and Medicaid payments that Washington would no longer have to provide for people who lost coverage.\n\nAt the same time, CBO said the repeal of the individual mandate\u2019s tax penalties would mean higher health insurance premiums for those who retained coverage, because insurers would still have to cover any applicant without being free to raise premiums for older, sicker people, despite lower numbers of younger, healthier customers who are cheaper to insure.\n\nCraig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said the CBO estimates made it harder for Republicans to sell their proposal.\n\n\"Overall, this is a really bad number for the AHCA. Far more people are predicted to lose coverage than many estimated - and these losses are going to happen more quickly than we would have thought,\" he said.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a key backer of the plan called the American Health Care Act, said the CBO estimates showed it would ultimately lower premiums.\n\n\"Our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down,\" Ryan said.\n\nVishnu Lekraj, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said the bill is a net negative for insurers, who would be helped by the elimination of a tax, but hurt by the shrinking individual insurance business.\n\n\u201cThe headline number will be viewed as a shock to the system tomorrow,\" Brian Tanquilut, a stock analyst at Jefferies said of the 14 million losing insurance next year. \"The reality of this is that the number being big makes it harder for the bill to pass in its current form.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Doina Chiacu, David Morgan, Mohammad Zargham and Richard Cowan in Washington; and Caroline Humer and Michael Erman in New York; Writing by Paul Simao and Amanda Becker; Editing by Will Dunham and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16K0ZX"}, {"title": "Tillerson used email alias at Exxon to talk climate: New York attorney general", "text": "NEW YORK U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\n\nThe attorney general's office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym \"Wayne Tracker\" from at least 2008 through 2015.\n\nWayne is Tillerson's middle name.\n\nThe letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman's investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, \"The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company\u2019s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics.\"\n\nJeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman's office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings.\n\nA State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account.

They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices.\n\nEnvironmentalists, who favor the standards, say the rules will reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them.\n\nTrade groups representing automakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota, have asked the EPA to withdraw the determination finalizing the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government.\n\nChanging the 2022-2025 fuel rules will require a lengthy regulatory process and environmentalists and Democratic state attorneys general are likely to sue if the Trump administration significantly weakens the requirements.\n\nThe Obama administration said in 2011 the changes would boost fuel efficiency to a fleet-wide average of 54.5 mpg, save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. The fuel standards were a central part of Obama's legacy on addressing climate change.\n\nIn July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average only 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025 under the rules because Americans were buying more sport utility vehicles and trucks and fewer cars.\n\nAutomakers briefed on the meeting do not expect the EPA to take action this week to attempt to prevent California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules.

The March order by contrast gave 10 days' notice to travelers and immigration officials.\n\nLast month, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle halted the first travel ban after Washington state sued, claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution. Robart\u2019s order was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nTrump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking Iraq off the list of countries covered. The new order still halts citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country.\n\nRefugees are still barred for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.\n\nWashington state has now gone back to Robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban.\n\nRobart said in a court order Monday that the government has until Tuesday to respond to the states' motions. He said he would not hold a hearing before Wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides.\n\nPROVING HARM\n\nSeparately, Hawaii has also sued over the new ban. The island state, which is heavily dependent on tourism, said the executive order has had a \"chilling effect\" on travel revenues.\n\nIn response to Hawaii's lawsuit, the Department of Justice in court papers filed on Monday said the president has broad authority to \"restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest.\" The department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks.\n\nThere is a hearing in the Hawaii case set for Wednesday, the day before the new ban is set to go into effect.\n\nThe first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving \"standing,\" which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue, in the eyes of a court.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, the states filed more than 70 declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses Amazon and Expedia, which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees.\n\nUniversities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in, as did religious organizations and individual residents, including U.S. citizens, with stories about separated families.\n\nBut the Trump administration in its filings in the Hawaii case on Monday said the carve-outs in the new order undercut the state's standing claims.\n\n\"The Order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa, and even as to them, it sets forth robust waiver provisions,\" the Department of Justice's motion said.\n\nThe government cited Supreme Court precedent in arguing that people outside the United States and seeking admission for the first time have \"no constitutional rights\" regarding their applications.\n\nIf the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue, the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against Muslims.\n\n\"The Trump Administration may have changed the text of the now-discredited Muslim travel ban, but they didn't change its unconstitutional intent and effect,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhile the text of the order does not mention Islam, the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is Trump's campaign promise of \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" He later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of \"extreme vetting\" of foreigners coming to the United States.\n\nThe government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by Trump or his aides.\n\n(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-idUSKBN16K264"}, {"title": "Millions to lose health insurance under Republican plan: congressional report", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump listens to Vice President Mike Pence speak during a meeting about healthcare at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 13, 2017.

The meeting, initially due on Tuesday, was postponed until Friday due to a severe winter storm expected in Washington.\n\nShe has watched Trump's speeches and pored over his interviews, including a lengthy Q&A with Playboy magazine from 1990 in which he floats many of the controversial ideas he is now trying to implement as president, they say.\n\nMembers of her entourage have also analyzed Trump's encounters with other leaders - including Britain's Theresa May, Japan's Shinzo Abe and Canada's Justin Trudeau - and have had exchanges with some of their counterparts on how to handle the unpredictable former reality-TV star, the officials added.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for the fact that he does not like to listen for long, that he prefers clear positions and does not want to delve into details,\" said one senior German official.\n\n'CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE'\n\nOn both economic and foreign policy, the divide between the two leaders appears vast.\n\nTrump, 70, has called Merkel's decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany a \"catastrophic mistake\".\n\nHe has threatened to impose tariffs on German carmakers that import into the U.S. market. And he has criticized Berlin for not spending more on defense, a longstanding U.S. complaint that Merkel has promised to address.\n\nAnother source of tension is Germany's 50 billion euro trade surplus with the United States.\n\nTrump adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro. Merkel and her ministers have pointed out that the European Central Bank - and not Berlin - controls the fate of Europe's single currency.\n\nRussia will also be on the agenda. White House officials have said Trump will seek advice from Merkel on how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFor her part, Merkel has been critical of Trump's travel ban targeting the citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. In a phone call in January, she explained to Trump that the Geneva Convention obliges signatories, including the United States, to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds.\n\nMerkel is also concerned that Trump, who has repeatedly praised Britain's decision to leave the European Union, might continue to undermine the bloc with his rhetoric at a time of deep crisis triggered by the rise of anti-EU populist parties.\n\n\"Europe is in a very fragile, precarious state and Germany is trying to ensure that the European integration project holds together. I suspect the chancellor will want to make this clear to the president,\" said Anthony Gardner, who served as U.S. ambassador to the European Union until January.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to sketch out areas of common interest, to define a positive agenda,\" he added. \"But one meeting won't change the atmosphere on its own.\"\n\nPOTENTIAL FOR SURPRISES\n\nTrump is the third U.S. president that Merkel, Europe's longest-serving leader, has worked with.\n\nShe established a good rapport with George W. Bush, who was keen to repair ties with Germany after his clash with Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder over the Iraq war.\n\nAnd although relations with Obama got off to an awkward start when Merkel rebuffed his request to speak at the Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 presidential campaign, the two grew close over time, cooperating on sanctions against Russia and launching negotiations on a transatlantic free-trade deal.\n\n\"The parting is hard for me,\" Merkel acknowledged when Obama visited Berlin in November, a week after Trump's victory.\n\nThe German leader will be walking a fine line in Washington.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON Aides to U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday attacked the credibility of the nonpartisan agency that will analyze the costs of a replacement for Obamacare, as the White House sought to quell opposition from many conservative Republicans.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, which provides official estimates of the budget impact of proposed legislation, is expected to issue a report as soon as Monday that will assess the healthcare legislation put forward by Republican House of Representatives leaders.\n\nThe report could influence sentiment toward a bill already under fire from Democrats and some Republicans, especially if it suggests the legislation would reduce the number of Americans with health coverage or worsen U.S. budget deficits.\n\nRepublicans have long opposed Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, on the grounds it was government overreach and led to higher insurance premiums. The 2010 law, Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, provided 20 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage.\n\nTrump has called Obamacare a \"disaster\" and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said on Sunday the replacement bill was unacceptable in its current form, including conservative Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who said the plan could not pass the Senate and could put the Republican House majority at risk in 2018 congressional elections.\n\n\"I believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of Americans and it wouldn't deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance for Americans,\" Cotton said.\n\nIn a series of television interviews, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the CBO was focusing on the wrong metrics with the estimates it will provide on the number of people who are insured. Cohn and Mulvaney said the CBO should instead should analyze whether patients can actually afford to go to a doctor.\n\n\"I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard, they do, but sometimes we ask them to do stuff they're not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isn't the - isn't the best use of their time,\" Mulvaney told ABC's \"This Week\" program.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said: \"We will see what the score is, in fact in the past, the CBO score has really been meaningless.\"\n\n\"They've said that many more people will be insured than are actually insured. But when we get the CBO score, we'll deal with that,\" Cohn said.\n\n'COWARDLY'\n\nThe Trump administration's criticisms of the CBO are unusual. Prior administrations, both Republican and Democratic, steered clear of attacking the credibility of the agency, which many lawmakers regard as a neutral arbiter. The CBO's current director, Keith Hall, was appointed by Republicans in 2015.\n\nThe credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has estimated 6 million to 10 million people could lose health insurance coverage under the Republican plan.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat, said it was \"cowardly\" for Republicans to proceed with a healthcare bill without CBO estimates, telling CBS' Face the Nation show: \"This is a disgrace.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have criticized what they said were overly optimistic estimates from the CBO of the number of Americans who would sign up for health insurance on government-run exchanges.\n\nThe CBO estimated in 2013 that 22 million people would be purchasing insurance through the exchanges in 2016. Only 10.4 million were signed up for those plans by the middle of last year, according to Department of Health and Human Services data.\n\nThe House Republican legislation would scrap tax penalties for Americans without health insurance, roll back an expansion of Medicaid insurance for the poor, and replace Obamacare's income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market.\n\nCohn also disputed the notion that millions of people on Medicaid would become uninsured as Obamacare's expansion of the program is rolled back over a period of years. He said many of these people would be transitioned into new private and employer-sponsored plans that would become more affordable under the Republican plan.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican plan's top backer in Congress, said he was \"certain\" the CBO would show a reduction in the number of Americans with coverage.\n\n\"You know why? Because this isn't a government mandate,\" Ryan told NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nConservative Republicans said, however, they could not support the plan without significant changes. Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said it did not go far enough to meet Republicans' promise to kill Obamacare.\n\n\"We told them we were going to replace it with something that would bring down the cost of insurance. That's what we told them,\" Jordan told Fox News Sunday. \"This legislation that the speaker's brought forward doesn't do that.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16J0XH"}, {"title": "Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 12 at 8:42 p.m. EST", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence (L) attend a healthcare meeting with key House Committee Chairmen at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 10, 2017.

What is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be Trump adversaries.\n\nSome Republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post-election. George Terwilliger, a senior Justice Department official under President George H.W. Bush, described the Obama lawyers' actions as \"unprecedented to my memory \u2013 and really bad form.\"\n\nOne reason for the Obama lawyers' quick moves, some of them said, was Trump's aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges.\n\nObama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for President George W. Bush, over issues such as immigration and Obamacare. But those came later in Obama's presidency.\n\nBesides Smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is advising California's legislature on challenging Trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, who is helping Hawaii contest Trump's revised travel ban.\n\nInfluential Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara and another 45 Obama-era U.S. attorneys are out of jobs after the Trump administration asked them to resign on Friday.\n\nMany of the Obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some Republicans, that Obama is behind resistance efforts. Some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to Trump's hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a unique threat to our democracy and Constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the Muslim community,\" said Smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the Justice Department.\n\nNorman Eisen, who was Obama's top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the Czech Republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after Trump's election. But instead, he said, \"the ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial Obama role.\"\n\nEisen is now also chairing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group he co-founded. The group has already sued Trump over alleged ethics violations.\n\nOther Obama appointees taking on Trump include former White House lawyer Ian Bassin who has founded United to Protect Democracy, a new group probing Trump over ethics; and James Cadogan, who worked with Smith at the Justice Department, and is now at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration.\n\nSome career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose Trump. One is Sharon McGowan, who worked on LGBT issues at the Justice Department.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at Lambda Legal, an LGBT advocacy group. McGowan said she decided to leave Justice when Trump named Jeff Sessions, a hardline conservative Alabama senator, to be attorney general.\n\nThat was a \"game-changer,\" she said. \"I knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what I\u2019ve been working on so hard.\"\n\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-lawyers-idUSKBN16K1MP"}, {"title": "Mike Pence to tour Asia next month amid security crises", "text": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the American Health Care Act during a visit to the Harshaw-Trane Parts and Distribution Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., March 11, 2017.

The risk for House members is that their votes could prompt a backlash in the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a budget that cuts State Department funds by one-third is unlikely to pass in his chamber.\n\nOther high-ranking Republicans are setting off alarms.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, following a White House lunch on Tuesday with Trump, said: \"What I told him is that when we get in a deadlock between the House and the Senate, different factions of the party ... you're the guy who needs to come down and close the deal.\"\n\nCole said Congress would ultimately have the final say on the budget.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019ll have a budget.

President Trump is concerned about the jurisdiction of this U.S. attorney and whether that might affect his future.\"\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain said he did not know what promises Trump might have made to Bharara in terms of keeping him on, but he said the president was within his rights to seek the resignation of political appointees from a prior administration.\n\n\"I do know that other administrations have done the same thing, perhaps not in as abrupt a fashion,\" McCain said on CNN\u2019s \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"Elections have consequences, so for people to complain about it they are ignoring the history of new presidencies and I think the president had every right to ask for their resignations,\" McCain said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Caren Bohan; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Grant McCool and Sandra Maler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice-idUSKBN16J0Y3"}, {"title": "NY prosecutor\u2019s office likely to plot similar course after Bharara\u2019s firing", "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON The Trump administration's firing of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara sent shockwaves through New York, but veterans of the high-profile office expect a longstanding mission of cracking down on political corruption and Wall Street wrongdoing to remain intact.\n\nStaffed with more than one hundred career prosecutors, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office has a long history of being apolitical and pursuing a wide range of investigations into terrorism, public corruption, securities fraud and cyber crime, former prosecutors said.\n\nLorin Reisner, former head of the office's criminal division from 2012 to 2014, who is now in private practice at law firm Paul Weiss, said the priorities of the office are unlikely to change, regardless of who replaces Bharara.\n\n\"Generations of SDNY prosecutors have been told that their job is to do the right thing, for the right reasons, every day, in every case,\" he said, using the acronym for the office, the Southern District of New York.\n\nHanging in the balance are ongoing investigations of potential fraud at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and its ties to a mail-order pharmacy and of two massive data breaches at Yahoo Inc, including one affecting more than one billion user accounts.\n\nThe office is also investigating a major cyber heist from the Bank of Bangladesh involving funds which moved through the New York Federal Reserve bank.\n\nBharara, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, lived up to the office's reputation, investigating Republicans and Democrats alike. He has been overseeing a probe into Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's fundraising.\n\n\"It would be tremendously difficult for any U.S. attorney to come in and politicize that office,\u201d said Carrie Cohen, a former prosecutor who worked under Bharara and is now in private practice at Morrison & Foerster.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has yet to announce a replacement for Bharara or the other remaining 45 U.S. attorneys from the Obama era who were asked to step down on Friday.\n\nU.S. attorneys are political appointees requiring confirmation by the U.S. Senate. They usually leave office when a new president is elected, although some remain for months to help with the transition.\n\nBut Bharara's removal from office came as a surprise because Trump had met with him after the election and indicated he would be retained. Bharara refused to resign, prompting his firing on Saturday.\n\nLATITUDE TO ESTABLISH PRIORITIES\n\nWhoever Trump appoints to replace Bharara will likely reflect U.S. Attorney General Jeff Session's priorities, including a desire to crack down on violent crime and less of a focus on civil rights cases.\n\nThere is growing speculation among former prosecutors and others in the legal community that Bharara's replacement will be Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer whose father served as attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush. Mukasey declined to comment on Sunday.\n\nIn the short-term, the office will be headed by acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim. He is a veteran of the office, returning under Bharara in 2013 as a key deputy following an earlier stint from 2000 to 2006. In between, he was a partner at the Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton law firm.\n\nA spokesman for the office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOutside of public corruption, Bharara was perhaps best known for overseeing a wave of cases focused on insider trading. Many of the investigations were already underway when Bharara took office in August 2009. But he became the face of the crackdown, landing on the cover of Time magazine in 2012 with the headline \"This man is busting Wall St.\"\n\nThe new U.S. attorney will have some latitude on what to focus on in the future.\n\n\"Each U.S. attorney has his own order of priorities and how they see the resources of the office best used and each U.S. attorney also has the right to discontinue an investigation if they feel it's a waste of time,\" said Ben Brafman, a leading defense lawyer.\n\nSessions has, however, already signaled a shift away from some Obama administration priorities.\n\nUnlike Bharara and his former bosses in the Obama administration, Sessions advocates trying foreign militants before military commissions instead of in civilian courts.\n\nBharara had pushed for trials in civilian courts while Sessions has criticized that approach and vouched for the ongoing value of trying foreign defendants before military tribunals.\n\nOn civil rights, Norman Siegel, former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said there was \"growing anxiety\" about the future of such cases since Bharara's firing.\n\n(Additional reporting by Nate Raymond, Mark Hosenball, Jonathan Stempel and Nathan Layne; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice-new-york-idUSKBN16K04T"}, {"title": "Puerto Rico creditors urge extension of fiscal plan deadline", "text": "Puerto Rico's new governor Ricardo Rossello (R) addresses the audience during his swear-in ceremony outside the Capitol in San Juan, Puerto Rico January 2, 2017.

Probably not. They are very different personalities,\" said Charles Kupchan, who advised Trump's predecessor Barack Obama on European policy as a member of the National Security Council.\n\n\"But I do think they have a strong interest, both politically and strategically, in learning how to work together. It is arguably the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Trump's presidency.\"\n\nGerman officials say the detail-oriented Merkel, 62, has been preparing assiduously for her trip to Washington.\n\nShe has watched Trump's speeches and poured over his interviews, including a lengthy Q&A with Playboy magazine from 1990 in which he floats many of the controversial ideas he is now trying to implement as president, they say.\n\nMembers of her entourage have also analyzed Trump's encounters with other leaders - including Britain's Theresa May, Japan's Shinzo Abe and Canada's Justin Trudeau - and have had exchanges with some of their counterparts on how to handle the unpredictable former reality-TV star, the officials added.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for the fact that he does not like to listen for long, that he prefers clear positions and does not want to delve into details,\" said one senior German official.\n\n'CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE'\n\nOn both economic and foreign policy, the divide between the two leaders appears vast.\n\nTrump, 70, has called Merkel's decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany a \"catastrophic mistake.\"\n\nHe has threatened to impose tariffs on German carmakers that import into the U.S. market. And he has criticized Berlin for not spending more on defense, a longstanding U.S. complaint that Merkel has promised to address.\n\nAnother source of tension is Germany's 50 billion euro trade surplus with the United States.\n\nTrump adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro. Merkel and her ministers have pointed out that the European Central Bank - and not Berlin - controls the fate of Europe's single currency.\n\nRussia will also be on the agenda. White House officials have said Trump will seek advice from Merkel on how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFor her part, Merkel has been critical of Trump's travel ban targeting the citizens of several mainly Muslim countries. In a phone call in January, she explained to Trump that the Geneva Convention obliges signatories, including the United States, to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds.\n\nMerkel is also concerned that Trump, who has repeatedly praised Britain's decision to leave the European Union, might continue to undermine the bloc with his rhetoric at a time of deep crisis triggered by the rise of anti-EU populist parties.\n\n\"Europe is in a very fragile, precarious state and Germany is trying to ensure that the European integration project holds together. I suspect the chancellor will want to make this clear to the president,\" said Anthony Gardner, who served as U.S. ambassador to the European Union until January.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to sketch out areas of common interest, to define a positive agenda,\" he added. \"But one meeting won't change the atmosphere on its own.\"\n\nPOTENTIAL FOR SURPRISES\n\nTrump is the third U.S. president that Merkel, Europe's longest-serving leader, has worked with.\n\nShe established a good rapport with George W. Bush, who was keen to repair ties with Germany after his clash with Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder over the Iraq war.\n\nAnd although relations with Obama got off to an awkward start when Merkel rebuffed his request to speak at the Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 presidential campaign, the two grew close over time, cooperating on sanctions against Russia and launching negotiations on a transatlantic free-trade deal.\n\n\"The parting is hard for me,\" Merkel acknowledged when Obama visited Berlin in November, a week after Trump's victory.\n\nThe German leader will be walking a fine line in Washington. With an election looming at home in September, she must avoid offering her political opponents ammunition by cozying up to Trump. Neither can she afford an open confrontation that might damage German interests.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns in the chancellor's camp before the visit is the potential for surprises.\n\nJapan's Abe had an awkward 19-second handshake with Trump, while May was criticized in some sections of the British media for holding hands with Trump during a stroll at the White House, apparently after he reached out to steady himself.\n\nWhen Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump last month, he and his team spent the day before running through endless scenarios, lines of questioning and role-plays to ensure they were prepared for any scenario.\n\nBut in the end, they were still taken aback when Trump spoke off the cuff at their news conference on the sensitive issues of settlements and a future Palestinian state.\n\nMerkel has admitted to being so uncomfortable with surprises as a child that she drew up her Christmas wish-list months in advance to avoid being caught off-guard by an unexpected gift.\n\nWith Trump, she might have to expect the unexpected.\n\n(Additional reporting by Andreas Rinke and Gernot Heller in Berlin, Steve Holland in Washington, Luke Baker is Jerusalem, Elizabeth Piper in London and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Pravin Char)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-merkel-idUSKBN16J0KK"}, {"title": "Trump economic adviser: Fed doing 'good job,' respects independence", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump's senior advisor Jared Kushner (L) and the head of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, talk with Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne (C) during Trump's meeting with U.S. auto industry CEOs at the White House in Washington January 24, 2017.

He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's fundraising.\n\nIn November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO).\n\nHe has also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders, including a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP.\n\nHis office has secured settlements with companies including General Motors Co (GM.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N); won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff; and prosecuted Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nBharara's priorities have often matched those set by Obama's Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nAmid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bharara's office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nU.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement that he was \"troubled\" to learn of the requests for resignations, \"particularly that of Preet Bharara.\"\n\nAs Schumer's chief counsel, Bharara helped lead the investigation of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nRobert Capers, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, issued a statement saying he had been asked to resign. He said Bridget Rohde, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in that office, would take over his role in an acting capacity.\n\nThe Justice Department said on Friday: \"Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney\u2019s offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Eric Walsh, Mark Hosenball and Joel Schechtman in Washington and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice-prosecutors-idUSKBN16H2K8"}, {"title": "Trump's revised travel ban dealt first court setback", "text": "Demonstrators rally against the Trump administration's new ban against travelers from six Muslim-majority nations, outside of the White House.

But opponents from several states have gone to court seeking to halt its implementation as well.\n\n\"The court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order,\" Conley wrote in his decision. \"As the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.\"\n\nIn a related development on Friday, the federal judge in Seattle who imposed a nationwide injunction on enforcement of the original travel ban refused a request to apply that order to the revised policy, saying that lawyers from states opposed to the measure needed to file more extensive court papers.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, California; Editing by Sandra Maler and Mary Milliken)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKBN16I02F"}, {"title": "House leader: 'very difficult' to speed up end to Medicaid expansion", "text": "WASHINGTON House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Friday it would be \"very difficult\" to accelerate the end of enrollment in the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, as some conservative members of his Republican Party have proposed.\n\n\"I think right now that'd be very difficult to do,\" McCarthy told a press conference in answer to a question about whether the proposed freeze on Medicaid expansion could be moved up by two years to 2018 in the Republican healthcare proposal now before the House of Representatives.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-medicaid-idUSKBN16H1Y9"}, {"title": "Trump to ask Merkel for advice on Putin, Ukraine: U.S. officials", "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacts to U.S. election results at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, November 9, 2016.

Courtesy The American Enterprise Institute/Handout via REUTERS\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump has chosen Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a conservative health policy expert with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the White House said on Friday.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Gottlieb would be in charge of implementing Trump's plan to dramatically cut regulations governing food, drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements and tobacco.\n\nGottlieb is well known on Capitol Hill, where he has testified multiple times on hot-button health issues, including complex drug pricing matters, and is viewed favorably by drug companies and pharmaceutical investors. He sits on the boards of several small drug and biotech companies and is an adviser to GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L).\n\n\"Thank God it's Gottlieb,\" Brian Skorney, an investment analyst at Robert W. Baird, wrote in a research note. \"We view this as a favorable development for the sector.\"\n\nGottlieb was chosen over Jim O'Neill, a libertarian investor close to Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder who now advises Trump on technology and science matters. O'Neill's stated view that drugs should be approved before being proven effective generated widespread alarm.\n\nGottlieb, 44, is a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank and a partner at a large venture capital fund. He is a former FDA deputy commissioner who has advocated a loosening of requirements needed for approval of new medical products.\n\n\"Scott knows how the agency works and he will move it forwards, though maybe not always in ways the agency is comfortable with,\" said John Taylor, a lawyer and president of compliance and regulatory affairs with the consulting firm Greenleaf Health and a former acting FDA deputy commissioner.\n\nIn addition to his public health and health policy roles, Gottlieb has for the past decade been a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a large venture fund with investments in the life sciences, medical technology and healthcare services.\n\nCritics of the nomination say Gottlieb's financial background present an array of potential conflicts of interest.\n\nDr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, said Gottlieb \"has spent most of his career dedicated to promoting the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry.\" If confirmed, he added, \"he will have to be recused from key decisions time and time again.\"\n\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT FDA EXPECTED\n\nStephen Ubl, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it \"looks forward to working with Dr. Gottlieb in his new role and engaging with him and the Agency as they seek to modernize the drug discovery and review process.\"\n\nGottlieb, who declined to comment on the nomination, is unlikely to up-end the FDA in the way O'Neill might have, but he is nonetheless expected to bring significant change, including moving the agency to increase flexibility in the clinical trial development process.\n\nIn this he will be supported by the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act which instructs the FDA among other things to consider the use of \"real world evidence\" to support new drug applications. This could include anecdotal data, observational studies and patient reports\n\n\"People don't want to take chances with safety, but there's increasingly some clamor to be more flexible on the efficacy side,\" said Kathleen Sanzo, who leads the FDA practice at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. \"You need to have some signal of efficacy. The question is, how much?\"\n\nThe FDA has attempted to push back against moves to sideline randomized clinical trials, long considered the gold standard. In January it issued a report documenting 22 cases in which drugs that appeared to show promise in early trials turned out to be either ineffective or unsafe or both in larger trials.\n\nOne of Gottlieb's priorities will likely be to streamline the process for approving generic versions of complex, difficult-to-copy therapeutics. He has stated publicly that he does not believe the FDA has good tools or policies to move such products and has advocated the creation of different approval standards.\n\n\"He's a thoughtful and nuanced kind of guy, and not solely an industry shill,\" said Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice.\n\nA survey conducted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc of 53 pharmaceutical executives found that 72 percent favored Gottlieb over other potential candidates. Many described him as knowledgeable, experienced and balanced.\n\n\"Gottlieb is someone who the industry and investors view as an incremental positive,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. \"The industry and investors need rational scientific logic and an understanding of risks and benefits.\"\n\nPatient advocates welcomed the news.\n\nGottlieb \"has firsthand experience at the FDA and as a physician that has treated patients understands the breadth of work that needs to be achieved on their behalf,\" said Ellen Sigal, founder of Friends of Cancer Research.\n\n(Reporting by Toni Clarke; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-fda-gottlieb-idUSKBN16H2AM"}, {"title": "Canada says most border-crossing asylum seekers were in U.S. legally", "text": "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (2nd L) poses with Canada's Innovation, Science and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains (L), Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale (C), Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland (2nd R) and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, March 10, 2017.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON The Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system cleared its first hurdles in Congress on Thursday, but its chances for passage looked uncertain and top Republicans scrambled to bring disgruntled conservatives aboard.\n\nIn the face of opposition by Democrats, healthcare providers and many conservatives, two House of Representatives committees approved the legislation that would undo much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, moving it closer to a vote before the full House.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee voted 31-23 along party lines, with Democrats unified against it, to back the plan after marathon proceedings lasting 27 straight hours. Hours earlier, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee similarly voted 23-16 before dawn to approve it after working 17 straight hours.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan sought to bolster support among conservatives in his own party, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said fellow Republicans must get in a \"governing mode\" while Trump denied the bill was in trouble.\n\n\"Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!\" the Republican president said on Twitter.\n\nThe bill would replace Obamacare's income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market, while ditching the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor. It would also end penalties for not having insurance, though insurers would be given permission to impose a 30 percent surcharge on customers who let their coverage lapse for more than two months and then seek to renew.\n\nHospital stocks, which has fallen after the plan was unveiled on Monday, ended broadly higher on Thursday, with Tenet Healthcare up 3.4 percent. Shares of health insurers were mixed, with most large insurers modestly higher and Medicaid-focused insurers ending negative, including Molina Healthcare's 3.3 percent drop.\n\nWhile Republicans have been itching for seven years to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the party has failed to coalesce behind the plan put forth by House Republican leaders.\n\nRepublicans control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time in a decade, but passage of the legislation was not a foregone conclusion.\n\nConservative lawmakers and lobbying groups have lambasted it as too similar to Obamacare. They have sharply criticized its proposed tax credits as an unacceptable new government entitlement program and have called for a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe measure is the first major legislative test for Trump and his fellow Republicans amid questions about whether they can govern effectively after years spent as an opposition party under Obama.\n\nRyan, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and using a video screen with facts and figures, held what he called a \"townhall-style\" presentation for reporters on the proposal. But his intended audience appeared to be fellow Republicans, and he said his party must \"actually make good on our word.\"\n\n\"The time is now,\" said Ryan, who long has been the target of criticism of some conservatives. \"This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare,\" Ryan added.\n\nMcConnell had a similar message, saying, \"We need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring.\"\n\nDemocrats denounced the bill as a gift to the rich that would force millions of people off of insurance rolls. Republicans said it was needed to roll back the government's \"nanny state\" role in the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system.\n\n\"Trumpcare is a loser for just about all of America, unless you're in the top 1 percent,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nThe House Budget Committee next Wednesday is due to merge the provisions approved by the two committees into one bill to be voted on by the full House before it goes to the Senate. Republican leaders are eyeing April for congressional passage of the bill.\n\n'ARBITRARY LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR'\n\nIn a series of tweets early on Thursday, conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton urged his House colleagues to pull back, saying their measure could not pass the Senate without major changes. \"What matters in long run is better, more affordable health care for Americans, NOT House leaders' arbitrary legislative calendar,\" Cotton wrote.\n\nBut White House spokesman Sean Spicer expressed confidence in the legislation's prospects. \"We're not jamming this down people's throat,\" Spicer said. \"This bill will land on the president's desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare.\"\n\nThe Brookings Institution think tank forecast that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected early next week to release its closely watched assessment of the bill's cost and coverage implications, would conclude that at least 15 million people would lose health insurance.\n\nCredit rating agency Standard & Poor's earlier estimated 6-10 million people could lose health insurance coverage.\n\nBefore the Energy and Commerce Committee vote, conservatives at the request of the panel's chairman withdrew an amendment sponsored by Republican Joe Barton that would move up by two years, to next Jan. 1, the end of the Medicaid expansion. Barton said he planned to try to offer the amendment on the House floor.\n\nCommittee Chairman Greg Walden hailed the unanimity of Republicans on the committee in approving the bill.\n\nObamacare enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage. About half came from the Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe bill's proposed changes in Medicaid funding could hurt smaller, less diverse health insurers, Fitch Ratings said, and the unintended, unforeseen consequences of a bill this size are likely to create uncertainty for all health insurers.\n\nWith doctors, hospitals, seniors, health plans, Democrats, some governors and conservative Republicans against the bill, it may not make it out of the House, Mario Molina, chief executive of managed care company Molina Healthcare, said in an interview.\n\n\"If it does, I think the Senate is going to slow things down and really take a good look,\" Molina said. \"We are going to have to hope that the Senate is more moderate.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Doina Chiacu, Caroline Humer and Lewis Krauskopf; Writing by Will Dunham; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Tom Brown)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16G0DP"}, {"title": "Trump invites Palestinian leader Abbas to White House: Abbas spokesman", "text": "As Trump seeks defense-spending boost, watchdogs cite faulty Pentagon accounting\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald J.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK The Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York, has a magnificent course. Just ask its namesake, U.S. President Donald Trump, who until recently was quoted on its website saying the club \"provides more than a membership \u2013 it's a true luxury lifestyle.\"\n\nThe business is worth more than $50 million and yielded more than $10 million from 2015 to early 2016, according to the financial disclosure form Trump filed last May. But seven months earlier, an attorney for Trump filed a lawsuit against the town of Ossining, New York, seeking lower taxes, claiming the course was worth only $1.4 million.\n\nThe lawsuit, which remains pending, has left at least one local official worried that taking a tough negotiating stance against a business owned by the world's most powerful political figure puts her town of 25,000 residents at risk of retribution.\n\n\"Are we, the puny town of Ossining, going to choose to go up against the president's company?\" said Dana Levenberg, the town supervisor. \"I wouldn't want to do anything that has negative repercussions for the town of Ossining.\"\n\nEthics experts said disagreements between Trump businesses and local governments create unavoidable conflicts of interest, since the federal government is a key source of funding and other benefits for municipalities and counties.\n\nOver decades as a hard-charging businessman, Trump has been embroiled in numerous legal battles with local governments, from lawsuits to property tax appeals to zoning fights.\n\nAt least half a dozen disputes, including the Westchester lawsuit, remained unresolved as the Trump presidency began in late January.\n\n\"Donald Trump has shown to date that he can play hardball in these kinds of disputes,\" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. \"I would imagine any local official would at least have a moment of pause before going as hard as they otherwise would against the Trump companies.\"\n\nBut some local officials said they would handle Trump-related disputes in the same manner as any other, without fear or favor.\n\nIn Florida's Palm Beach County, where a Trump golf course was challenging its tax bill, the county mayor, Paulette Burdick, allowed that Trump's position as president \"would pop into my mind\" but insisted that officials treat every resident equally.\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump Organization also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlthough federal conflicts of interest law does not apply to the president, Trump has nevertheless faced criticism since his election about the potential conflicts posed by his business empire. Past officeholders have generally placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n\nTrump, however, has refused to do so, instead turning over day-to-day management of his companies to his two adult sons without divesting his stake. Ethics experts have said that solution does nothing to address the problem, since Trump still stands to profit from businesses that remain under the control of his immediate family.\n\nAccording to public records and interviews with officials, Trump's pending tax disputes at the time of his inauguration included cases in Florida, where his lawyers challenged the tax bills for two Trump-owned golf courses; Washington, D.C., where Trump's new hotel sued the district over its assessment; and Chicago, where Trump's company filed multiple lawsuits seeking property tax relief for a hotel.\n\nNew York City records show Trump companies were seeking tax breaks for commercial space at both Trump Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower. The president also filed appeals in Los Angeles County over the value of his Beverly Hills mansion.\n\nOver the years, Trump has repeatedly brought lawsuits against Palm Beach, Florida, for various issues related to Mar-A-Lago, his \"winter White House,\" though no case is active. His golf courses also frequently require permits from local governments for construction and development.\n\nFederal decisions on everything from antiterrorism funding to infrastructure projects can have an outsized impact on states and cities.\n\nThe mere appearance of a possible quid pro quo \"undermines public confidence,\" said Larry Noble, the general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group dedicated to democratic reform.\n\n\"It just distorts the decision-making field,\" he said. \"There are numerous ways a president can help a local government \u2013 or not.\"\n\nNot all local officials share Levenberg's concerns.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, Steven Abrams is both a county commissioner and the chairman of the value adjustment board, which handles tax appeals, placing him squarely in the middle of the issue. But he said Trump's status would have no impact on the process.\n\n\"There are pretty standard formulas for determining\" property values, he said. \"There's not a lot of room for discretion based on who you are.\"\n\nFor her part, Levenberg said the prospect of going up against the president's business is \"really scary.\"\n\nBut she said she has become more emboldened in recent months after receiving supportive emails from residents urging her to hold the line.\n\n\"You should be paying your share of taxes,\" she said. \"You need to shoulder your part of the community burden. And if you're not doing it, that means everybody is picking up the slack for you.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax and Grant Smith; Additional reporting by Zachary Goelman; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-conflicts-idUSKBN16H0JN"}, {"title": "EPA chief unconvinced on CO2 link to global warming", "text": "WASHINGTON The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants Congress to weigh in on whether CO2 is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the Trump administration will make an announcement on fuel efficiency standards for cars \"very soon,\" stressing that he and President Donald Trump believe current standards were rushed through.\n\nPruitt, 48, is a climate change denier who sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times as Oklahoma's attorney general. He said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal is the main cause of climate change, a conclusion widely embraced by scientists.\n\n\"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"So no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,\" Pruitt said. \"But we don\u2019t know that yet, we need to continue to debate, continue the review and analysis.\u201d\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, including those aimed at combating climate change. He framed his stand as aimed at boosting U.S. businesses, including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries.\n\n\"We can be pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-environment,\" Pruitt said Wednesday afternoon in a Houston speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives.\n\nScientists immediately criticized Pruitt's statement, saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change.\n\n\"We can\u2019t afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy. Embracing ignorance is not an option,\" Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said in a statement.\n\nThe Supreme Court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Two years later, the EPA declared carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping gases to be pollutants.\n\nPruitt said the Supreme Court's decision should not have been viewed as permission for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"Decisions were made at the executive branch level that didn't respect the rule of law,\" Pruitt said in his Houston speech.\n\nREGULATING CO2\n\nPruitt has previously said the EPA should not regulate CO2 without a law passed by Congress authorizing it to do so. The Republican-controlled Congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the EPA that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency, a move that would undermine many Obama-era rules aimed at curbing emissions.\n\n\"Administrator Pruitt is correct, the Congress has never explicitly given the EPA the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so,\" said Mike Danylak, spokesman for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel that oversees the EPA.\n\nWhen asked at his confirmation hearing in January whether he would uphold the EPA endangerment finding, Pruitt said it was the \"law of the land\" and he was obliged to uphold it for now.\n\nPruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his Houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding.\n\nAs Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court.\n\n\"The mask is off. After obscuring his true views during his Senate confirmation hearings, Scott Pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier,\" said David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe new EPA chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce \"regulatory uncertainty.\"\n\nPruitt added that he shared Trump's view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015 was a \"bad deal.\" Trump promised during his campaign for the White House to pull the United States out of the accord, but has since been mostly quiet on the issue.\n\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Editing by Eric Walsh, Dan Grebler and Bernard Orr)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt-idUSKBN16G1XX"}, {"title": "Tillerson has recused himself from Keystone pipeline issues: State Dept.", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stands during a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin at the State Department in Washington, U.S., March 7, 2017.

Does the New York businessman live up to the image of dealmaker in chief?\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen White House and congressional aides, members of Congress and conservative activists offer a glimpse into his attempts at conducting the most formidable, high-stakes negotiation of his presidency.\n\nThey show a more circumspect Trump than many see publicly. While they acknowledge he can make his points with a blunt and combustible style, he appears to be doing more listening than talking, they said, trying to appease both supporters and critics by signaling flexibility over legislation that faces criticism on multiple fronts.\n\nDemocrats and some influential Republicans say it would rip health insurance away from millions of Americans and increase costs for many others, including voters who helped elect Trump - a problem that could haunt his fellow Republicans in 2018 congressional elections.\n\nConservatives say it does not go far enough in gutting the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform passed by Democrats in 2010. Republicans have long sought to dismantle the law, which they see as government overreach. Trump has called Obamacare a \"disaster\" and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge.\n\nThe political stakes are immense for an eight-week-old presidency marked by instability, infighting, battles with the media, questions over temperament and a stubborn investigation into ties between his campaign and Russian intelligence.\n\n\u201cA lot of times you have politicians who gather in a room to pontificate. That\u2019s not why he has gathered people in the room,\u201d a senior White House official said of Trump\u2019s negotiation style this week. \u201cHe\u2019s gathered people in to hear their opinions. I think that\u2019s lost a little bit because he does speak so forcefully. He definitely does let them say their piece, and he listens.\u201d\n\nThe president has reached out to influential conservatives such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and groups such as the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, which have expressed skepticism about the bill.\n\n\u201cHe was gregarious, reasonable. He listened. It was a not a lecture,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of AFP, a group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch and part of a small group of conservative leaders who met with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018This is a negotiation. Let\u2019s figure out ways to make this proposal better,\u2019\u201d Phillips said of Trump.\n\nTrump has indicated he will only go so far to make conservatives happy, insisting the core elements of the bill must remain intact if it has any chance to pass the House of Representatives and then the Senate, both controlled by Republicans. One sticking point involves the use of tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance, which Trump favors.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made it clear this is the vehicle to finally undo the damage of Obamacare and repeal and replace it,\u201d said another senior White House official. \u201cAnd if it can be improved in this process, he has encouraged that.\u201d\n\nTHIN MARGIN FOR SUCCESS\n\nTrump is operating with a razor-thin margin for success. A defection by 20 or so Republicans in the House could sink the bill\u2019s prospects. There is already discontent among some in the Senate, where Republicans hold an even slimmer edge. Democrats and groups such as AARP, which advocates for older Americans, and the American Medical Association have come out strongly against the bill.\n\nConservatives in the House and advocacy groups opposed to the bill would like to slow the process and rework its fundamentals. They argue the legislation retains basic facets of Obamacare, including federal assistance to purchase health insurance and penalties if coverage lapses.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is hoping to pass the legislation within two weeks so the House can move on to other priorities. That leaves little time for wholesale alterations.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected the bill would largely remain in its current form. \u201cI know lots of people have good ideas. That\u2019s terrific. And those will fit in future bills.\"\n\nThe White House has tried to persuade conservatives that the House bill is just the first step in a three-step process, and will soon be joined by a companion bill that would embrace some of their policy priorities. Regulations put in place by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will also address their concerns, aides said.\n\nThe challenge for Trump is whether he can convince enough wary conservatives to back the first step of the plan without being able to guarantee the other phases will come to pass. It could leave them on the record voting for a bill they do not feel adequately dismantles Obamacare.\n\nSome conservatives may also not see the point of sticking their necks out backing a bill that may die in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is a futile effort,\u201d said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, which opposes the bill.\n\n'MAKING PEOPLE FEEL LOVED'\n\nThe White House is aggressively making the case that the House bill is the best chance to do away with Obamacare.\n\nMoving too far rightward to placate conservatives could stir up opposition from moderate Republicans and lead to a bill that stokes a powerful backlash among millions of Americans who would lose health insurance - including many Republicans. Many Democrats are already planning to run campaigns on the issue.\n\nThe White House was busy this week trying to reassure moderate Republicans as well.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is holding meetings in Congress, including with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican aide said. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, a former House member, has invited conservative lawmakers to dinner at the White House next Tuesday.\n\nTrump plans to leverage the power of his office in another way, making trips to Kentucky and Tennessee in coming days to sell the House bill to the American public.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump welcomed about 30 Republican House members, many of whom said they had never been in the White House before - a contrast in style from Obama, who was often criticized for not attempting to engage more fully with Congress. In the East Room, Trump told them to come back every week.\n\nGrover Norquist, a longtime conservative tax advocate, praised Trump\u2019s strategy, saying: \"He is making people feel loved and appreciated and part of the team.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Caren Bohan; Writing by James Oliphant; Editing by Jason Szep and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-obamacare-analysis-idUSKBN16H05H"}, {"title": "More states seek to halt Trump's new travel ban in court", "text": "Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin speaks at a press conference after filing an amended lawsuit against President Donald Trump's new travel ban in Honolulu, Hawaii, March 9, 2017.

A hearing in that case is set for next Wednesday, a day before the clock starts on the new order.\n\nThe states and immigration advocates argue the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims.\n\nMORE EXEMPTIONS\n\nTrump's new executive order was designed with the intention of avoiding the legal hurdles.\n\nWhile the new order keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, it excludes Iraq.\n\nRefugees are still halted from entering the country for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.\n\nThe revisions include explicit exemptions for legal permanent residents or existing visa holders and waivers are allowed on a case-by-case basis for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.\n\nThe first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving \"standing,\" which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals a court would rule have a right to sue.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-legal-idUSKBN16G2RC"}, {"title": "FBI's Comey meets with top U.S. congressional leaders", "text": "FBI Director James Comey speaks at the Boston Conference on Cyber Security at Boston College in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., March 8, 2017.

It plans to merge with a rival in southwestern Pennsylvania in a deal that will roughly double its size.\n\nTrump officials cited a dearth of applications to form new community banks and around a 30 percent drop in the number of small U.S. banks since 2008 as the impetus for the meeting. A smaller bank has gone out of business every day for the past seven years, Szyperski said, citing the Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the 2007-2008 financial crisis as a reason new banks had not formed in their stead.\n\nTrump promised the bankers that his February executive order on reducing regulation was \"very powerful\" and would apply to the community banking sector.\n\nMnuchin, the former CEO of OneWest bank, a regional lender in Southern California, said at his confirmation hearing in January that onerous regulations are \"killing community banks.\" He pledged to ease those burdens while maintaining \"proper\" regulation, \"so that we don't end up with a world where we only have four big banks in this country.\"\n\nAlso discussed at the meeting were the compliance costs associated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a new regulator created under Dodd-Frank.\n\nThe CFPB is a perennial target for Republicans, who want to shift its funding from the Federal Reserve to annual appropriations by Congress and shift its management, now concentrated in a powerful chairman, to a multi-person commission structure.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, when asked during a briefing with reporters whether Trump still backs his campaign pledge to restore the Glass-Steagall Act, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that he did. The law, which separated commercial and investment banking activities, was repealed in 1999 and, if reinstated, would mainly apply to larger banks.\n\nThe Trump administration has not made any moves thus far to break up big banks. Investors have bid up bank stocks since Trump's election on expectations they would get regulatory relief but not be forced to divest.

The relocation is strongly opposed by many U.S. allies because both Israel and the Palestinians claim the city as their capital.\n\nTrump's selection of Friedman reflects his shift in policy toward Israel after years of friction between former President Barack Obama and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Trump has wavered on the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, long a bedrock of Washington's Middle East policy, and backed the embassy's relocation.\n\nFriedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements.

It was a central campaign issue in 2016. The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee approved the bill along party lines early Thursday after nearly 18 hours of debate.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee was still debating the bill Thursday, after an all-night session where Democrats fought the measure and used numerous tactics to delay a vote.\n\nThe bill could still change substantially as it makes its way through committees. Here are its main provisions:\n\nTAXES\n\nThe Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacare's income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacare's credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.\n\nThe Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums, tanning salons and prescription medications. It would also delay a tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance known as \"Cadillac\" plans until 2025.\n\nThose taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.\n\nThe bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.\n\nAnd it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.\n\nMEDICAID\n\nUnder Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, made the Medicaid government health insurance more accessible to the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion.\n\nThe bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis.\n\nStates that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people.\n\nState Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacare's exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover.\n\nINSURANCE COVERAGE\n\nThe Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacare's most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parents' health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage.\n\nBut the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.\n\nInsurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.\n\nThe measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients.\n\nThe bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\n(Reporting By Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-factbox-idUSKBN16G288"}, {"title": "CIA contractors likely source of latest WikiLeaks release: U.S. officials", "text": "The Consulate General of the United States of America is pictured in Frankfurt, Germany March 8, 2017.

It is not clear if the investigation of the latest CIA leaks is part of the probe.\n\nContractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) while working for the National Security Agency.\n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches.\n\n\"I think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don't do it,\" Feinstein said.\n\nBoth U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said.\n\nSome cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former President Barack Obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure.\n\nThose concerns would grow if U.S. authorities did not notify companies that CIA documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised.\n\nApple, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a CIA breach before WikiLeaks made its files public.\n\nAt Apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there.\n\nGoogle's director of information security and privacy, Heather Adkins, said in a statement: \"As we\u2019ve reviewed the documents, we're confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections.\"\n\nLARGER NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS\n\nOne reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by Russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that Russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published.\n\nOne European official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the WikiLeaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between European intelligence agencies and U.S. counterparts, which share concerns about Russian intelligence operations.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to tilt last year's U.S. presidential election in Trump's favor, including by hacking into Democratic Party emails. Moscow has denied the allegation.\n\nOne major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has \"exploded\" because of federal budget constraints, the first U.S. official said.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the \"internet of things\" that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents.\n\nA person familiar with WikiLeaks\u2019 activities said the group has had the CIA hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works \"for a long time.\"\n\nIn Germany on Wednesday, the chief federal prosecutor's office said that it would review the WikiLeaks documents because some suggested that the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt.\n\n\"We will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators,\" a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office told Reuters.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit Washington on March 14 for her first meeting with Trump, who has sharply criticized Berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.\n\n(Reporting by John Walcott, Mark Hosenball, Dustin Volz, Yara Bayoumy in Washington and Matthias Sobolewski and Andrea Shalal in Berlin; Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Writing by Grant McCool; Editing by Peter Graff and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-idUSKBN16F2AP"}, {"title": "CIA leak shows lack of progress in combating 'insider threats'", "text": "WASHINGTON The disclosure this week of documents describing secret CIA hacking tools shows that intensified U.S. government efforts to prevent leaks by intelligence agency employees and contractors have largely failed, cyber security professionals and intelligence officials say.\n\nIf the Central Intelligence Agency disclosures are confirmed to be the work of an intelligence agency contractor, as government investigators currently suspect, it would be at least the third public case in recent years in which special software and human resources programs intended to catch so-called insider threats have not worked.\n\nThe anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published the CIA documents Tuesday, said it obtained the archive after it circulated among former U.S. government contractors in \"an unauthorized manner.\"\n\nPart of the problem in combating leaks is that the number of government employees and contractors with access to highly sensitive information has exploded in recent years, due in part to greater information-sharing across the government that was mandated in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBudget constraints that force agencies to rely on contractors rather than permanent staff have also contributed to the problem, intelligence officials say. Government estimates of how many people have been granted Top Secret clearances range from the high hundreds of thousands to more than a million across thousands of public agencies and private companies.\n\nGovernment agencies estimate that there is one insider threat for every 6,000 to 8,000 employees, an intelligence agency contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting his employer. The contractor said there is too much sharing of information internally, with many workers having access to material they do not need.\n\nRecognizing the dangers, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order creating the National Insider Threat Task Force in 2011, following the disclosures of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables that were stolen by former Army private Chelsea Manning and provided to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe order covered virtually every federal department and agency, including the Department of Education, the Peace Corps and other offices not directly involved in national security.\n\nThe program requires federal employees to monitor co-workers for suspicious actions based on behavioral profiling. Those who fail to report high-risk people or behaviors could face penalties, including criminal charges.\n\nInsider threat investigations can also be launched when computer network monitoring detects \u201csuspicious user behavior,\u201d according to government documents.\n\nMonitoring of prospective and current government employees has only increased in recent years. Under a directive issued in May 2016 by James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, U.S. officials evaluating whether employees should continue to have access to classified information can collect publicly available social media posts of those workers.\n\nDespite the new initiatives and a raft of innovative employee monitoring technologies developed by the NSA and private-sector tech companies, insider threats remain \"the greatest worry across government and industry,\" said Curtis Dukes, the former head of cyber defense at the National Security Agency who now works at the Center for Internet Security, a non-profit organization committed to protecting against cyber threats.\n\nCIA \"GOLD STANDARD\"\n\nTuesday's leaks came at a time when U.S. intelligence agencies were already reeling from the discovery that former contractor Harold Martin had allegedly spent 20 years stealing secrets from the NSA and three other intelligence agencies before finally being caught last summer.\n\nMartin worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, the same consulting firm that employed Edward Snowden, who in 2013 exposed details about U.S. spying programs.\n\nThis week's dump of CIA files is especially alarming because the spy agency is considered the \"gold standard\" for monitoring and tracking insiders, according to Larry Pfeiffer, chief of staff to then-CIA director Michael Hayden.\n\nLeo Taddeo, chief security officer at Cryptzone and a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cyber crime division in New York, said the Sept. 11 attacks prompted a significant expansion in the number of facilities and government contractors who had access to sensitive information. A 2003 report on the attacks concluded the plot could have been disrupted if not for lapses of communication between the CIA and FBI.\n\nThat finding and others forced a restructuring of how U.S. intelligence agencies share information, overcoming resistance by some officials who worried the new arrangement could create new problems.\n\n\"We need for the right people to see the right dots, so they can connect them, but the counter argument is you increase the insider risk and that compromise has a greater impact,\" Taddeo said.\n\nChris Inglis, former deputy director of the NSA, gave a presentation entitled \"How to Catch a Snowden\" to a jam-packed room last month at the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco. The talk was so popular that conference organizers had Inglis present twice.\n\nInglis said companies, as well as governments, need to embrace continuous monitoring of employees and the use of behavioral analytics to spot potential leakers, and to directly involve human resources departments in detection efforts.\n\nSome companies have been hesitant to adopt such strategies, Inglis said, but a raft of breaches in recent years has led to a growing embrace of more aggressive approaches.\n\n\"The unfortunate truth is you\u2019re only going to suffer this one in a million times, but that one in a million can kill you,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz and Jonathan Landay; Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco and Warren Strobel, John Walcott and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Leslie Adler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-threats-idUSKBN16G05N"}, {"title": "U.S. Senate leader expects review of healthcare bill by Monday", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said he expects congressional analysts to unveil their review of the cost and impact of House Republican's healthcare plan by Monday.\n\nIn an interview with Politico, McConnell said senators will have plenty of opportunities to amend the plan, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump was \"all in\" the party's efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-mcconnell-idUSKBN16G1YD"}, {"title": "Hawaii issues first challenge to Trump's new travel ban", "text": "FILE PHOTO: A view of Honolulu, Hawaii is seen from the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific November 9, 2011.

REUTERS/Hugh Gentry/File Photo\n\nThe state of Hawaii requested emergency court intervention on Wednesday to halt a revised executive order from President Donald Trump placing U.S. entry restrictions on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nArguing that the new travel ban violates the U.S. Constitution, the state asked a Hawaii federal court to grant a temporary restraining order that should apply nationally.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled earlier in the day that the state could sue over Trump's new order, which was signed by the president on Monday.\n\nIt is the first legal challenge to the revised order.\n\nWatson said the state could revise its initial lawsuit, which had challenged Trump's original ban signed in January.\n\nA hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect.\n\nThe government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks.\n\nSome legal experts have said court challenges will be more difficult now because changes to the order give exemptions to more people.\n\nThe revised travel order changed and replaced the original, more sweeping ban issued on Jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports and was challenged in more than two dozen lawsuits around the country. A federal judge in Seattle put the first order on hold, in a decision upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco.\n\nThe new order is much more narrowly tailored. It keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, but excludes Iraq and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants. It also removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria.\n\nThe order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers.\n\nImmigration advocates have said the new ban, like the original one, discriminates against Muslims.\n\nBut the first hurdle in a lawsuit is proving \"standing\" to sue, which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals that a court would rule have a right to sue.\n\nSTATE CLAIMS HARM\n\nHawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. It also says the island state's economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. The court papers cite reports that travel to the United States \"took a nosedive\" after Trump's actions.\n\nThe state was joined by a new plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an Imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii whose mother-in-law lives in Syria, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"This second Executive Order is infected with the same legal problems as the first Order,\" the state said in court papers filed on Tuesday. The President's order \"is subjecting a portion of Hawaii's population, including Dr. Elshikh, his family, and members of his Mosque, to discrimination and second-class treatment,\" Hawaii said.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Elshikh fears his mother-in-law will not be able to enter the country under the new order. \"The family is devastated,\" the filing said.\n\nOne of the groups eligible for waivers under the new ban are those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry.\n\nAdam Lauridsen, a San Francisco attorney representing students challenging Trump's first order, said the waiver provisions in the new ban are similar to case-by-case exemptions allowed in the first ban. Earlier legal challenges were allowed to move forward despite those waivers, he said.\n\nIn support of its actions, the Trump administration has cited a section of law that says the president can suspend entry to the United States by \"any class\" of foreigners if he finds it would be \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country.\n\n(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler and John Stonestreet)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-legal-idUSKBN16F2IM"}, {"title": "China gives greenlight to dozens of Trump trademarks", "text": "FILE PHOTO: The Trump Tower logo is pictured in New York, U.S., May 23, 2016.

REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nSHANGHAI/WASHINGTON China has granted preliminary approval for 38 trademarks linked to Donald Trump, documents on China's state trademark office show, giving the U.S. President and his family protection were they to develop the \"Trump\" brand in the market.\n\nThe trademarks - which in theory cover a wide sweep of businesses from hotels to mobile libraries and escorts - underline the complexities and potential concerns over conflicts of interest facing President Trump, who has a sprawling business empire using the Trump name around the world.\n\nTrump, a wealthy real estate developer, has previously said he has handed over his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons and a Trump Organization executive. He can, however, revoke the trust at will and, as its sole beneficiary, remains linked to it financially.\n\nThe trademarks - mostly variations in English and Chinese on the name \"Donald Trump\" - were given preliminary approval in two lists published on the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce on Feb. 27 and Monday.\n\nTrump's lawyers applied for the trademarks in April last year, mostly registered to \"Donald J. Trump\" and listing to the address of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York.\n\nSome U.S. law makers have raised questions about whether Trump's position as President could prompt preferential treatment of his businesses. Trademark lawyers, however, said that the approval process did not seem that unusual.\n\n\"If they were filed in April last year and just now approved, it's fairly normal,\" said Yong Heng Wu, Shanghai-based counsel for MWE China focused on intellectual property, adding the general timeframe for preliminary approvals was 6-9 months.\n\n\"I think the reason why people are paying so much attention to Donald Trump trademarks now is because he became the President of the most powerful country in the world.\"\n\nThe trademarks cover business areas including branded spas, massage parlors, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, retail shops, restaurants, bars, bodyguards and escort services.\n\nIntellectual property lawyers said trademark applications were often very broad to give the applicant the most comprehensive protection for their brand.\n\nThree of them, related to hotel brand Scion that Trump's sons want to expand in the United States, are not directly registered in the President's name but via DTTM Operations LLC. The three are also listed to the Trump Tower address.\n\nAsked about the approvals, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had always \"equally\" protected trademarks for Chinese and foreign companies, adding that the approvals process had been carried out in line with the law.\n\nPOLITICS AND BUSINESS\n\nThe preliminary approvals are open to be challenged for around a 90-day period. Barring objections they will be formally registered in late May and early June respectively.\n\nTrump and his family, like many business owners, hold trademarks around the world, from business sectors such as apparel in the Philippines to golf clubs in Australia and property in Japan and South Korea.\n\nThese ties between politics and business have, however, prompted concern from politicians and rights groups who say the President could face potential conflicts of interest related to the extensive business affairs of his family.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in a statement the group had been actively enforcing its intellectual property rights in China for over a decade.\n\n\"The latest registrations are a natural result of those long-standing, diligent efforts, and any suggestion to the contrary demonstrates a complete disregard of the facts as well as a lack of understanding of international trademark law.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for formal briefings about the Chinese trademark approvals and on \"the potential constitutional dangers that they present.\"\n\nCardin has previously introduced a resolution demanding Trump cut his ties with the Trump Organization or risk violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress.\n\nChang Tsi & Partners, listed as acting on behalf of Trump's team for the China trademark applications, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the approvals.\n\nTrump received a single trademark approval last month in China for Trump-branded construction services, following a 10-year legal battle.\n\nThe Associated Press earlier reported the approvals.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING, Heekyong Yang in SEOUL, Sam Nussey in TOKYO and Neil Jerome Morales in HANOI and Byron Kaye in SYDNEY; Editing by James Dalgleish and Clarence Fernandez)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-trademarks-idUSKBN16F2JP"}, {"title": "Medical providers oppose Trump-backed health plan, Democrats take aim", "text": "House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) arrives for a closed Republican party conference at the Republican National Committee in Washington, U.S., March 8, 2017.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON The top U.S. doctors' organization and several hospital groups came out strongly on Wednesday against a Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul America's healthcare system, as Democrats mounted a fierce battle to thwart the bill.\n\nTwo House of Representatives committees debated the plan late into the night, two days after the proposals were unveiled by Republican leaders. The legislation aims to repeal and replace the Obamacare law, which Republicans call a government overreach that has ruined healthcare in the United States.\n\nTrump and fellow Republicans in Congress campaigned last year on a promise to dismantle the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, they face resistance from conservatives in their own party who have condemned the bill as too similar to the law it is meant to supplant. Democrats, meanwhile, have denounced it as a gift to the wealthy that will take insurance away from millions of people.\n\n\"What they\u2019re doing is very destructive. ... It represents the biggest shift of money to the wealthiest people in our country, the top 1 percent, at the cost of working families,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters.\n\nDoctors and other providers said the bill would probably cause many patients to lose insurance and raise healthcare costs. The American Medical Association urged senior lawmakers in a letter to reconsider drastic changes to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe AMA, which supported Obamacare, said the replacement of income-based subsidies with age-based tax credits to help people buy insurance would make coverage more expensive, if not out of reach, for poor and sick Americans.\n\nObamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage, about half through a Medicaid expansion the new bill would end.\n\nInsurers are worried about the affordability of the tax structure and proposed major changes in Medicaid financing.\n\nIn a letter to Congress, America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents Anthem Inc and others, indicated that was still a concern, despite many aspects of the draft that would help stabilize the individual insurance market.\n\nSeven hospital groups, including the American Hospital Association, America's Essential Hospitals and the Catholic Health Association of the United States, also voiced opposition. They wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the proposal could lead to \"tremendous instability\" for people seeking affordable medical coverage, including children, the elderly and disabled.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade. But the bill's fate is far from certain, with a number of Republican conservatives saying it is not a full repeal and sets up new entitlement programs.\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence met leaders of conservative groups who have concerns about the bill.\n\n\"I\u2019m encouraged that the president indicated they are pushing to make changes,\" David McIntosh from one of those groups, Club for Growth, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nA White House official said Trump and Pence were \"open to constructive improvements that maintain the core principles and get the bill over the goal.\"\n\n\"CONSERVATIVE WISH LIST\"\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee, with jurisdiction over taxes, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health issues, kicked off what could become marathon sessions working on the legislation.\n\nThe plan would scrap the Obamacare requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and would replace its income-based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to coax people to buy private insurance on the open market.\n\nTrying to mollify skeptics in his party, House Speaker Paul Ryan, an architect of the plan, touted it as \"a conservative wish list\" and \"monumental, exciting conservative reform.\"\n\nRepresentative Mark Walker, head of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest group of conservatives in Congress, said RSC leaders might support the bill if two changes are made.\n\nThe first, proposed by Representative Joe Barton in the Energy and Commerce Committee, would bring forward the end of enrollment in Medicaid expansion by two years to January 2018. The second would make age-based tax credits for purchasing health insurance partially rather than fully refundable.\n\nWith those changes, \"we\u2019d be a hard 'yes',\" Walker told reporters.\n\nDemocrats were using every procedural maneuver possible to delay the committee work, including demanding votes to adjourn on the House floor. The top Energy and Commerce Committee Democrat, Representative Frank Pallone, called the Republican plan \"a prescription for disaster\" and said not a single hearing had been held to develop the bill.\n\nRepublicans insisted on committee action even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had not yet done its customary assessment of the cost of the measure and how many people it would cover.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said: \"If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place.\"\n\nWays and Means Democrats raised questions over the bill's proposed tax break for insurance company executives, with Representative Lloyd Doggett calling it a \"$400 million windfall\" for insurance company executives.\n\nHospital stocks clawed back some of Tuesday's losses after the bill's unveiling. Community Health Systems Inc rose 4.5 percent and Tenet Healthcare Corp gained 1.5 percent. Health insurer shares, including WellCare Health Plans Inc and Aetna Inc, closed moderately higher.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Morgan, Caroline Humer, Eric Walsh, Susan Heavey, Doina Chiacu, Toni Clarke and Steve Holland in Washington, and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Will Dunham and Nick Tattersall; Editing by Leslie Adler, Jonathan Oatis and Paul Tait)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN16D2RC"}, {"title": "CIA 'mission' on cars shows concern about next-generation vehicles", "text": "FILE PHOTO: People are silhouetted as they pose with laptops in front of a screen projected with binary code and a Central Inteligence Agency (CIA) emblem, in this picture illustration taken in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina October 29, 2014. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/Illustration\n\nSAN FRANCISCO WikiLeaks documents showing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency considered a \"mission\" against connected car technology underscores auto industry concern that the science behind the next generation of vehicles could be turned against them.\n\nCyber security is considered key to the rollout of tomorrow's self-driving and today's connected cars, which resemble computers on wheels with a host of communications routes that hackers could target.\n\nIf consumers are to trust smart vehicles, they must deem them safe from attack. Security experts cite the terrifying hypothetical example of a remote attack on a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel or brakes, in which the passenger would have no recourse to regain manual control of the car.\n\n\"You have a lot of car companies trying to design cars to be better suited to automation, which means they're more attractive to hackers,\" said auto consultant Roger Lanctot of Strategy Analytics.\n\nA major strategy for automakers is to reduce the number of communications gateways to crucial systems and to require services offered by third parties to go through a single secure path.\n\nWikiLeaks documents show the CIA citing \"vehicle systems\" and a car operating system from QNX, owned by Blackberry Ltd, as \"potential mission areas\" for the CIA's \"Embedded Devices Branch\" to consider.\n\nThe QNX operating system, which is used by most global automakers, provides a \"a comprehensive, multi-level, policy-driven security model ... to mitigate attacks,\" the company said in a statement to Reuters. But given the collection of software, hardware and network components that make up a connected car, \"security is only as strong as its weakest link,\" it said.\n\nWhile the CIA's interest in cars brought widespread attention, the industry has already received wakeup calls about cars' potential to be hacked.\n\nResearchers in 2015 used a wireless connection to turn off a Jeep Cherokee's engine, prompting a recall of 1.4 million vehicles by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nIn September last year, Chinese cyber security researchers hacked a Tesla Inc Model S sedan, remotely tapping the brakes and popping the trunk. The electric carmaker subsequently patched the bugs using an over-the-air fix. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its cyber security protocol.\n\nThe hacking of the Jeep and the Tesla \"brought it home to the industry that even if its improbable it's technically possible,\" said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of the automotive practice at AlixPartners.\n\nIf a car was seen as vulnerable, it \"could be a big brand problem,\" Wakefield said. Hacks could also expose private information shared between car and third parties - credit card numbers, account numbers or passwords - to theft.\n\nA January survey by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that 33 percent of respondents said they were \"extremely concerned\" over hacking of full self-driving cars to cause crashes.\n\nCLOSING DOWN THE WAYS IN\n\nThe number of ways into cars has proliferated, from cell phone signals to dongles. One such gateway is the standard OBD-II port found under the steering wheel historically used for onboard diagnostics. Today, hundreds of after-market devices use the port, whether to monitor driving for insurance needs or provide conveniences like safety alerts.\n\n\"The security of these devices is important, as it can provide an attacker with a means of accessing vehicle systems and driver data remotely,\" warned the FBI in a March 2016 bulletin on cyber security risks to motor vehicles.\n\nCarmakers are also building walls between non-crucial infotainment systems and driving controls so that any breach is blocked before it could compromise key functions like brakes.\n\nThe first step the industry is tackling is intrusion detection, said Lanctot. But what to do when a breach is detected is complicated, because shutting off parts of a car could be unsafe, he said.\n\nTesla was first to champion \"over-the-air\" technology in which wireless software updates are sent remotely to cars. Although some have argued such updates are a way in for hackers, Tesla and others see them a key protection to upgrade security and repair vulnerabilities quickly.\n\nIn January, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill calling for cyber security standards for new cars but so far U.S. regulators have issued recommendations, not rules, on how carmakers should shield their computer systems from hackers.\n\nThe industry is \"years away\" from solving the cyber security problem, Lanctot said, noting that the first generation of cars built after the Jeep hack that include some kind of detection capabilities will not be seen until early in 2018.\n\n(Reporting By Alexandria Sage; editing by Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-autos-idUSKBN16G09Z"}, {"title": "Ex-Utah Governor Huntsman accepts Trump offer to be ambassador to Russia: official", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Republican presidential candidate former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman addresses supporters at his New Hampshire primary night rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., January 10, 2012.

Icahn, an unpaid adviser to Trump on regulation, submitted a proposal to Trump last month to change the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard by shifting the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from oil refining companies, and further down the supply chain to marketers.\n\nPublic Citizen said that, because Icahn owns a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from the proposed change, he may have been required by a 1995 lobbying disclosure law to disclose his discussions with Trump on the subject as lobbying. The group said it has made its request for a probe in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"All of this has occurred with no record of any (Lobbying Disclosure Act) filings by or on behalf of Mr. Icahn,\" Public Citizen said in a copy of the letter provided to Reuters.\n\nIcahn did not respond to Reuters requests for comment but described the complaint in an opinion piece on The Hill website as a \"gross misstatement of the facts\" and said he had vetted his activities with lawyers.\n\n'ETHICS ROCK AND A LOBBYING HARD PLACE'\n\nThe RFS, signed into law by former President George W. Bush, requires oil companies to mix increasing levels of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year - a requirement that many refiners say costs them millions of dollars. Oil companies can either blend biofuels or buy paper credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN), from those that have.\n\nIcahn owns an 82-percent stake in refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), which along with other refining companies, has urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to shift the blending obligation away from them.\n\n\"While we are not fighting the Renewable Fuel Standard, I have for months and will continue to speak out against the misguided way in which the EPA has been administering the RFS\" with regards to the agency's handling of a \"corrupt\" RIN market, Icahn said.\n\nEfforts to reach the White House were not immediately successful.\n\n\"Carl Icahn is between an ethics rock and a lobbying hard place,\" said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. \"If he claims he is an informal advisor, then he is subject to lobbying rules.\"\n\nIcahn has disclosed his role as a Trump adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but he has not registered as a lobbyist. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they want more information about his role in the Trump administration.\n\nShares of CVR Energy jumped over 1 percent following Icahn's response but pared gains and was unchanged at $21.40 by 3:47 p.m. EST (2047 GMT). Share values have risen about 70 percent since the presidential election. Over that time, Icahn's stake has gained over $600 million in value, according to Reuters data.\n\nLast week, the head of a U.S. biofuels group said Icahn told him that Trump was readying an executive order to change the point of obligation for blending under the biofuels program, something both the White House and Icahn have denied.\n\nThe White House has said it is reviewing Icahn's proposal and has not yet taken a position.\n\n(Reporting by Chris Prentice in New York; Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson and Lawrence Hurley in Washington; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Marguerita Choy)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-icahn-idUSKBN16F0GR"}, {"title": "Senators ask if U.S. paying to secure Trump property overseas", "text": "WASHINGTON Three U.S. senators asked the secretaries of State, Defense and Homeland Security on Wednesday if they were spending government resources to secure President Donald Trump's properties around the world.\n\nIn a letter, the three Democrats also asked the cabinet members whether they had been asked by the Trump Organization to protect its properties, and whether extra funding would be requested to cover the costs.\n\nTrump's continued ownership of the Trump Organization means the overseas properties are prime targets for terrorist attacks, which could directly impact Trump's net worth and potentially \"lead the country into new conflicts around the globe,\" the senators wrote.\n\nA State Department official, speaking on background, said that privately owned U.S. companies, such as the Trump Organization, are responsible for providing their own security for assets overseas.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the questions in the letter.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nWASHINGTON Two senior senators asked the FBI and Justice Department on Wednesday for any information they have on President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor Barack Obama wiretapped him during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nIn a letter to James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse wrote:\n\n\"We request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders ... related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump campaign, or Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nUnder U.S. law, presidents cannot direct wiretapping. Instead, the federal government can ask a court to authorize the action, but it must provide justification.\n\nAsked at a briefing on Wednesday if Trump was the subject of a probe, White House spokesman Sean Spicer replied: \"There is no reason that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever.\"\n\nCritics of Trump in Congress have accused him of issuing the wiretap allegation to try to deflect attention from investigations into his administration's possible ties to Russia. Some have likened it to Trump's long-held contention that Obama was not born in the United States and thus did not legitimately hold the office of president - an accusation he did not withdraw until 2016.\n\nDianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, told CNN she had not seen any evidence that Obama had tapped Trump's phone.\n\n\"It's all rather shocking to me that a sitting president would make this kind of an allegation about a former president without any proof whatsover,\" she said. \"I believe it's patently false.\"\n\nSUBPOENAS\n\nGraham later told CNN that if the Justice Department does not cooperate with the senators' request, subpoenas would be issued.\n\n\"I expect them to come forward as to whether or not a warrant was obtained or sought,\" Graham said. He chairs a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Whitehouse is the senior Democrat on the panel.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump accused Obama of phone surveillance, amid a swirl of questions about possible ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In a chart of exploits for Apple\u2019s iPhone, the most recent version listed as hackable was iOS 9.2, which was released in late 2015.\n\nQ: What did we learn about the CIA's hacking program?\n\nA. WikiLeaks published documents that it says describe CIA tools for hacking into devices including mobile phones, computers and smart televisions.\n\nQ: How can you hack a TV?\n\nA: WikiLeaks said it identified a project known as Weeping Angel where U.S. and British intelligence agencies developed ways to take over Samsung smart TVs equipped with microphones, forcing them to record conversations when the device appeared to be turned off. Experts have long said smart TVs and other Internet-connected devices can be exploited to monitor a target.\n\nQ: Are these revelations new?\n\nA: While the specific details are new, it is well known in the cyber security community that intelligence agencies are constantly trying to leverage flaws in technology products to conduct espionage.\n\nQ: The documents suggest that the CIA can access information in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. I thought they were safe from even government spying?\n\nA: No system is perfect. The documents describe ways to get information in those apps on Android devices, but only after gaining full control of those phones. Reuters has not found evidence in the documents released by WikiLeaks that the CIA had figured a way to break the encryption in those apps.\n\nQ: Are iPhones also vulnerable?\n\nA: The documents discuss ways to get into iPhones as well. One appeared to show a list of Apple iOS security flaws purchased by U.S. intelligence agencies so they could gain access to those devices.\n\nQ: What should I do if I'm worried?\n\nA: Most people do not need to worry about being targeted by intelligence agencies. But everybody should stay on top of software patches so all their computers, mobile phones and other connected devices are running software with the latest security updates. Consumers should balance security concerns with their need to use smart devices.\n\nQ: What did we learn about how the CIA may try to make American hacking look like the work of hackers from other countries like Russia?\n\nA: The CIA has a library of attack code taken from multiple sources and sorted by function, including a program from a Russian criminal kit that permits spyware to survive rebooting and a data-destruction tool lifted from a suspected Iranian operation. One purpose of such a collection is to avoid having to write programs from scratch, while another is to confuse anyone who discovers the malware in action.\n\nThe documents released so far do not show that the CIA set out to deceive victims into believing they had been hacked by someone else, but it suggests that the agency was capable of doing so if it wanted.\n\nQ: Is this as big as the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden?\n\nA: The Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting U.S. call metadata on ordinary Americans. The materials released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday did not appear to reveal the existence of unknown any unknown programs. Instead they supplied details on how U.S. intelligence agencies work to discover and exploit security flaws to conduct espionage.\n\nQ: How damaging is this revelation to U.S. intelligence?\n\nA: U.S. intelligence officials say the damage is limited because much of what was published is old, a number of the vulnerabilities in smart TVs and other devices have been known for at least two years and many have been patched. The breach was discovered late last year according to U.S. officials and most or all of the tools Wikileaks published are no longer in use.\n\nIn addition, they said, unless additional codes that would enable users to exploit the leaked material are also published, it would be difficult for other countries, groups, or people to use the leaked material against the United States or its allies.\n\nQ: Are the documents authentic?\n\nA: Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. U.S. officials told Reuters that they believe the documents are authentic. While the CIA has declined to comment, independent cyber security experts and former intelligence agency employees who have looked through them say that they appear to be authentic, citing code words used to describe CIA hacking programs.\n\nQ: How did WikiLeaks get the information?\n\nA: Unclear. Someone inside the agency may have leaked the information. Or, someone outside may have figured out a way to steal it. U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that contractors were the likely source for the leak.\n\nQ: What has the U.S. government and other governments said in response?\n\nA: The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was \"extremely concerned\" about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release.\n\nGermany's chief federal prosecutor's office said it would review the Wikileaks documents which suggest the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, and would launch a formal investigation if warranted.\n\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, Jonathan Weber in San Francisco and Dustin Volz in Washington; editing by Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-q-a-idUSKBN16F2P8"}, {"title": "Democrats ask White House about Trump son-in-law's potential conflicts", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump and his senior advisor Jared Kushner arrive for a meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. February 23, 2017.

At full force, the SEC has five voting members, including the chair.\n\nClayton also promised to divest, within 90 days of confirmation, some 176 assets collectively worth millions of dollars. He did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nClayton and his wife, Gretchen Butler Clayton, reported assets between $52.3 million and $130.4 million. Because nominees for Executive Branch positions report their assets in broad ranges, it is impossible to calculate a nominee's exact net worth.\n\nHe has assets related to his employment at Sullivan & Cromwell worth between $2.5 million and $8.4 million, the OGE form shows. His wife works at Goldman Sachs & Co, and has assets related to her role at the investment bank worth between $1.1 million and $2.8 million. She has said she will resign her job if he is confirmed.\n\nThe form also does not detail the specific assets from which Clayton will divest to comply with federal ethics laws. But in his March 3 letter to an ethics officer, Clayton did indicate that he will seek to take advantage of a tax benefit that allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on assets they sell to satisfy ethics requirements, potentially saving him millions of dollars.\n\nAs a Wall Street attorney, Clayton has worked on notable deals including the initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the subject of federal investigations related to drug pricing, was listed as one of his clients. Clayton also reported having two corporate clients he could not name due to pending investigations that are not yet public.\n\nThe SEC is an independent federal agency tasked with enforcing securities laws and regulating the country's stock and options exchanges. Agency nominees are reviewed by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, which is set to hold Clayton's initial confirmation hearing on March 23.\n\n(Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Tom Brown, Bernard Orr)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-nominee-idUSKBN16F24W"}, {"title": "Disney CEO says staying on Trump advisory council", "text": "Disney's Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger holds a news conference at Shanghai Disney Resort as part of the three-day Grand Opening events in Shanghai, China, June 15, 2016.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON When the bosses of some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies headed to Washington in January to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting.\n\nJust weeks before, Trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of \"getting away with murder\" by charging too much for medicines.\n\nBut the Trump who greeted chief executives of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Novartis (NOVN.S), Merck (MRK.N), Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Celgene (CELG.O) and Amgen (AMGN.O) on Jan. 31 was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the Oval Office, according to several participants in the breakfast.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be,\" said one industry insider familiar with the meeting.\n\nTrump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry. Instead, he focused on \"outdated\" regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers, according to participants interviewed by Reuters. The CEOs left with Trump's word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high U.S. corporate tax rate.\n\nSince taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders, including automakers, airlines, retailers and health insurers. On Wednesday, he was hosting lunch for a group of New York real estate developers and private equity CEOs, during which possible private-public partnerships on infrastructure would be discussed, according to a person briefed on the meeting.\n\nInfographic ID: '2mXttym'\n\nIn early morning or late-night tweets and in speeches, Trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing, often knocking down their share prices.\n\nBut Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.\n\nWhen he meets the nation's top chief executives in person, he is a mix of charm and cajoling. This Trump is flexible and inquisitive, a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings.\n\nThis private side of Trump sheds light on why many CEOs have expressed confidence that the Republican president is good for business, despite his share-denting public attacks. As recently as Tuesday, Trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing, sending pharma shares lower.\n\nIn the White House meetings, Trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations, the sources said, underscoring one of his administration's key priorities - getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. He typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues, executives say.\n\n\"He said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then it's like kumbaya,\" said one person who was briefed on a meeting between Trump and a group of CEOs.\n\n\"He likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders,\" said this person.\n\nA former businessman, Trump runs his closed-door meetings with CEOs as if they were a corporate board meeting, attendees said. In contrast to his doctrinaire tweets, he likes to seek input from everyone at the table, and compared to former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, conversations are less scripted.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to these meetings is \u201cone of listening and not lecturing\u201d, said a senior White House official who has participated in industry meetings. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a president who is listening and asking questions to get to how he can create a thriving economy,\u201d the official said.\n\nAn Amgen spokeswoman said Trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on U.S. job creation and biotech innovation. Representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment.\n\nSHOWING OFF THE DRAPES\n\nBecause so little is known about how Trump interacts privately with CEOs, trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him.\n\n\u201cThere is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect, what to do,\u201d said one trade group official who prepared CEOs for a recent meeting with Trump. He said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a White House visit.\n\nAt the end of most meetings, Trump leads CEOs into the Oval Office, showing off paintings, sculptures and the furniture, as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out. He also points out a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., which he inherited from Obama. Then he takes a group photo behind the desk.\n\n\u201cHe becomes tour guide and brings them over to the Oval Office,\u201d the same official said. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nThe White House official said Trump recognized the \u201cawe\u201d of the Oval Office.\n\nCHAIR FOR GM, BIRTHDAY WISH FOR FORD\n\nChief executives of Detroit's top three automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) - were pleasantly surprised when they went to the White House for a breakfast with Trump on Jan. 24.\n\nSince his election, Trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in Mexico and warned U.S. firms would no longer be able to move U.S. jobs abroad \"without consequences.\"\n\nWhen Trump entered the Roosevelt Room, he greeted GM CEO Mary Barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the United States and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started, a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows.\n\nHe greeted Ford CEO Mark Fields with a \"Happy Birthday. It's his birthday ladies and gentlemen.\" Trump said it was a \"great honor\" to see Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.\n\nTrump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the United States - as he had tweeted he would before the meeting - but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them, people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nFord declined to comment and referred to Fields' comments to dealers in January that Trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra said in a speech last week that Trump \u201creally listened\u201d to the automakers, while Marchionne told reporters at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday that Trump was \u201cquite willing to make our lives easier\u201d in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage U.S. job creation.\n\nTrump has been complimentary of his high-profile guests - and at times playful.\n\nAfter Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup (CPB.N), introduced herself in one of those meetings, Trump quickly responded: \"Good soup.\"\n\nAt another, after Target Corp (TGT.N) CEO Brian Cornell spoke, Trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as \u201cTar-Jay,\u201d a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy.\n\n(Reporting by Ginger Gibson and David Shepardson in Washington, Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson in Washington and Emily Flitter in New York, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Ross Colvin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-companies-insight-idUSKBN16F18M"}, {"title": "Factbox: Compare and contrast - Trump's tweets vs private comments to CEOs", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump has gone on Twitter to lambaste a number of companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing.\n\nBut Reuters interviews with executives and lobbyists who met with him at the White House reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.\n\nHere are some of the examples to illustrate the difference in tone:\n\nWhat he tweeted about automakers:\n\nJan. 3 - General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nNEW YORK The House Republican health insurance plan suggests health insurance after Obamacare will be less affordable, investors, insurers and industry sources said on Tuesday, raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation.\n\nThe draft legislation, released on Monday night, rolls back some of the key tenets of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare, including the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid. In addition to eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance, it creates a system of new tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market.\n\nThe bill has the support of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to repeal and replace the 2010 law. But some Republican lawmakers whose support is needed for the final legislation - and Democrats - said they wanted details on how it would affect U.S. consumers.\n\nUnder the draft legislation, Obamacare\u2019s income-based and location-based tax credits are replaced by credits with fixed amounts up to a maximum income level.\n\nBecause the bill has just been proposed and aims mostly to repeal the existing law rather than introduce new policies, it is unclear exactly how future changes could make the plan affordable and draw insurers into the market.\n\nBut some initial reaction, particularly from hospitals, was critical. The American Hospital Association said in a letter to Congress that it could not support the draft legislation in its current form.\n\nThe BlueCross BlueShield Association, which represents BCBS insurers across the country that cover the vast majority of the about 10 million people enrolled in 2017 Obamacare plans, said the insurers were glad to see the extension of many Obamacare aspects into 2019. But it emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable.\n\n\"It is important that the tax credit for 2020 creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford,\" BCBSA Senior Vice President Alissa Fox said in statement.\n\nThe Association for Community Affiliated Plans, which represents health plans serving Medicaid for the poor and other public health programs, said it was concerned the structure would raise costs for people currently in the marketplace.\n\nBecause insurance costs, healthcare costs and incomes vary so dramatically around the country, the new tax credit would affect some people more than others.\n\n\"I think there's a reasonable concern that people in high-cost states who are lower income will have a hard time finding affordable care,\" said Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute.\n\nBut the draft legislation also sets up a $100 billion fund over 10 years that states could use to structure subsidies for their members and offset some of that, he noted. Insurers have also asked to be able to offer plans with fewer benefits that could be sold at lower prices, Howard said.\n\nSince the draft removes the mandate requiring people to have insurance, the impact on enrollment from that measure is not clear.\n\nStandard & Poor's estimated that the draft plan would reduce individual enrollment, now at around 10 million, by 2 to 4 million people.\n\nSteve Brozak, managing partner at WBB Securities, said he believed that under the Republican package, \"people will be forgoing insurance.\"\n\nHe also said that, as it is currently designed, insurers will have difficulty attracting people who do not have an immediate need for healthcare, like younger, healthy people who are less expensive to insure.\n\nStill, Brozak expects that this draft is only a first step and likely to change. It is expected to be voted on this month in the House before moving to the U.S. Senate.\n\nSHARES FALL\n\nThe draft plan, along with Republicans' proposed restructuring of the Medicaid program for the poor and the loud opposition from some Republican lawmakers, created uncertainty that drove down shares of hospitals and insurers.\n\nRepublicans will need the buy-in from BlueCross BlueShield insurers like Anthem Inc, particularly after UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) exited most of the states where they sold individual insurance plans under Obamacare.\n\nShares of hospital operators sold off, with Community Health Systems (CYH.N) down more than 8 percent and Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) off 7 percent. Reaction in health insurer stocks was more subdued. Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) fell 1.3 percent and Cigna (CI.N) dropped 1 percent, while Humana (HUM.N) gained more than 2 percent and Anthem (ANTM.N) was little changed.\n\nThe American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, which represents doctors, declined to comment on the draft legislation.\n\nSupport for government-run health insurance has risen over the past five years, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll.\n\nBetween February and March, 47 percent of Americans said the government should have at least a \u201cmajor role\u201d in providing health insurance. That was up from 39 percent who answered the same way when the poll first asked the question in January 2012.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest poll ran from Feb. 25 to March 6 and included responses from more than 2,700 American adults.

KCNA/via REUTERS\n\nWASHINGTON Faced with a growing test of resolve for a new U.S. president who vowed while campaigning to get tough on North Korea, Donald Trump's aides are pressing to complete a strategy review on how to counter Pyongyang's missile and nuclear threats.\n\nPyongyang's latest missile launches and the assassination in Malaysia of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged half-brother have added urgency, driving home the need for Washington to confront the security challenge.\n\nAll options are on the table, ranging from tighter sanctions aimed at pushing North Korea back into disarmament talks, to a return of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea, and even pre-emptive air strikes on North Korean missile installations, senior U.S. administration officials said.\n\nThey added a consensus was forming around relying for now on increased economic and diplomatic pressure \u2013 especially by pressing China to do more to rein in North Korea - while deploying advanced anti-missile defenses in South Korea and possibly in Japan, as well.\n\nAmong the other possibilities, one U.S. official said, was returning North Korea to the U.S. list of countries that support terrorism.\n\nThat would be a response to the suspected use of nerve gas to kill Kim's brother at a Malaysian airport last month. It would subject Pyongyang - already heavily sanctioned by the United Nations and individual states, so far to little effect - to additional financial sanctions that were removed when it was taken off the list in 2008.\n\nFor now, U.S. officials consider pre-emptive military action far too risky, given the danger of igniting a regional war and causing massive casualties in Japan and South Korea and among tens of thousands of U.S. troops based in both allied countries.\n\nSuch ideas could gain traction, however, if North Korea proceeds with a threatened test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. Just before he took office in January, Trump tweeted: \"It won't happen!\" when Kim said North Korea was close to testing an ICBM.\n\nTrump also could opt for escalating cyber attacks and other covert actions aimed at undermining the North Korean leadership, a U.S. government source said.\n\nREVIEW COULD BE COMPLETED THIS MONTH\n\nThe review is expected to be completed by the end of the month, officials said. Decisions could be held up, however, by the slow pace at which Trump has been filling national security jobs.\n\nTrump is known to have little patience for detailed foreign policy discussions, but officials said he seemed to have heeded a warning from his White House predecessor, Barack Obama, that North Korea would be the most urgent international issue he would face - so much so that he requested intelligence briefings on the issue.\n\nWhile officials have stressed the need to persuade China to do more to pressure North Korea, Trump's first concrete response to North Korea's missile tests has been to start installing an advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea, which has incensed Beijing.\n\nDiplomats said the move might reassure U.S. allies but could backfire by antagonizing China, which regards the system as a threat, and make it less willing to step up sanctions on its neighbor.\n\n\"You have to adjust and calibrate all the options based on the facts on the ground,\" said an administration official, who added that media reports highlighting military options were overblown.\n\n\"The ability to have sanctions that pack some punch and are more dynamic than we have had in the past is going to be dependent to some extent on Chinese cooperation,\" he said.\n\nChinese diplomats argue that Beijing is doing all it can.\n\nBonnie Glaser at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies said China could close banks that conduct illicit financial transactions with North Korea, prosecute front companies facilitating business, cut off oil exports and expel North Korean workers.\n\nNO GOOD MILITARY OPTIONS\n\nGlazer said she saw no good military option. While past talks have failed, she would not be surprised if Trump wanted to try diplomacy.\n\nOne idea could be to discuss a freeze in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which would fall short of current demands for nuclear disarmament.\n\n\"North Korea may insist on being recognized as a nuclear weapons state as a precondition, in which case the U.S. would have to decide whether to make that concession,\" she said.\n\nEvans Revere, a former senior diplomat who dealt with Korea under President George W. Bush, said Washington should pressure North Korea with sanctions, military deployments and covert operations.\n\n\"Doing this would ... compel the regime to rethink its course and make it more likely to return to dialogue and denuclearization, lest it risk collapse,\" he said.\n\nWhether Trump will be willing to tolerate the level of risk needed to make such a strategy work remains unclear.\n\n\"This is an administration that is more inclined to be averse to regime change than previous administrations,\" the first administration official said. \"That's from the top down.\"\n\n\"This administration intends to come up with options based on the cards we are dealt; not try to change the deck entirely, which is what regime change is.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, Steve Holland, John Walcott and Phil Stewart in Washington and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-trump-analysis-idUSKBN16F08O"}, {"title": "Hawaii to file first court challenge to new Trump travel order", "text": "Immigration activists, including members of the DC Justice for Muslims Coalition, rally against the Trump administration's new ban against travelers from six Muslim-majority nations, outside of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington, U.S., March 7,...

It was a central campaign issue in 2016. Two House committees will next review the bill, so it could still change substantially. Here are its main provisions:\n\nTAXES\n\nThe Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacare's income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacare's credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.\n\nThe Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as \"Cadillac\" plans.\n\nThose taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.\n\nThe bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.\n\nAnd it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.\n\nMEDICAID\n\nUnder Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion.\n\nThe bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis.\n\nStates that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people.\n\nState Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacare's exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover.\n\nINSURANCE COVERAGE\n\nThe Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacare's most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parents' health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage.\n\nBut the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.\n\nInsurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.\n\nThe measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients.\n\nThe bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\n(Reporting By Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-factbox-idUSKBN16E2EC"}, {"title": "Health secretary says healthcare bill is 'work in progress'", "text": "FILE PHOTO - Rep.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump signed a revised executive order on Monday banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States but removing Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts.\n\nThe new order, which takes effect on March 16, keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It applies only to new visa applicants, meaning some 60,000 people whose visas were revoked under the previous order will now be permitted to enter.\n\nImmigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against Muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous order. Legal experts said it would, however, be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the United States and allows more exemptions to protect them.\n\nTrump, who first proposed a temporary travel ban on Muslims during his presidential campaign last year, had said his original Jan. 27 executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants.\n\nIt sparked chaos and protests at airports, where visa holders were detained and later deported back to their home countries. It also drew criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America's leading corporations before a U.S. judge suspended it on Feb. 3.\n\n\"As threats to our security continue to evolve and change, common sense dictates that we continually re-evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters after Trump signed the new order.\n\nPELOSI SAYS BAN STILL 'IMMORAL'\n\nDemocrats, a minority in Congress, quickly signaled fierce opposition to what they called a discriminatory ban.\n\n\"The Trump administration\u2019s repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their Muslim and refugee ban,\" House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nFarhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington, said the Trump administration had \"doubled down on anti-Muslim bigotry.\"\n\nShe told reporters on a conference call: \"It\u2019s crystal clear this is a Muslim ban.\"\n\nBut some Republicans who had been critical of Trump's original order were more positive on the new one.\n\nBob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was \"very encouraged\" by the approach and pleased that Iraq was removed from the list.\n\nIraq was taken off the banned list because the Iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures, such as heightened visa screening and data sharing, and because of its work with the United States in countering Islamic State militants, a senior White House official said.\n\nTrump's original ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in U.S. courts. The Justice Department estimated 60,000 people had their visas revoked by the first order but senior administration officials said on Monday those visas were now valid again for entry into the United States.\n\n\"By rescinding his earlier executive order, President Trump makes one thing perfectly clear: his original travel ban was indefensible - legally, constitutionally and morally,\" said Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended.\n\nHis office will likely decide this week on whether to proceed with litigation over the new order, he said.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version.\n\n\"A watered down ban is still a ban,\" he said in a statement. \"Despite the administration's changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American. It must be repealed.\"\n\nHARDER TO CHALLENGE\n\nThe fact the ban affects fewer people already in the United States means it will be more difficult for opponents to find plaintiffs who have been harmed by the order and thus have legal standing to challenge it, legal experts said.\n\nThe revised order expressly makes waivers possible for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for \"significant business or professional obligations.\"\n\n\"They dotted their i's and crossed their t's in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor.\n\nThe revised order means that tens of thousands of legal permanent U.S. residents - or green card holders - from the listed countries will no longer be affected.\n\nThe original order barred travelers from the seven nations from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were to be banned indefinitely but under the new order they are not given separate treatment.\n\nRefugees \"in transit\" and already approved would be able to travel to the United States under the new order.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, who along with several other senior Cabinet members had lobbied for Iraq's removal from the list of banned countries, was consulted on the new order and the updated version \"does reflect his inputs,\" Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said.\n\nThousands of Iraqis have fought alongside U.S. troops for years or worked as translators since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Many have resettled in the United States after being threatened for working with U.S. troops.\n\n(Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Doina Chiacu, Tim Ahmann and Idrees Ali in Washington, Mica Rosenberg in New York and Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Trott, Nick Tattersall and Bill Rigby)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-exclusive-idUSKBN16D154"}, {"title": "Revised U.S. travel ban will still curtail tourism, U.N. tourism body says", "text": "BERLIN U.S. President Donald Trump's move to revise a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries will not lessen its impact on tourism, the head of the UN World Tourism Organization said.\n\n\"People don't go to places where they don't feel welcome,\" Taleb Rifai, the secretary general of the tourism organization, told Reuters, before the world's biggest travel trade fair, ITB Berlin, opens on Wednesday.\n\nTrump on Monday signed a revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States but removing Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts.\n\n\"It's not about the details of which countries are included, it's about the attitude,\" Rifai said on Tuesday.\n\nLast week, he told Reuters that the United States had lost $185 million in one month after the first ban was introduced and stood to lose tens of millions more each month if similar policies continued.\n\nData from travel analysis company ForwardKeys this week showed that demand for travel to the United States over the coming months had already flattened out following a positive start to the year.\n\nBut any downturn in demand for travel to the United States is not expected to have an impact on travel in general.

REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO The new, more narrowly tailored temporary travel ban President Donald Trump signed on Monday will be more difficult to challenge successfully in court, legal experts said.\n\nThey said that since his order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers, challengers are likely to have a harder time finding people in the United States who can legally claim they have been harmed, and thus have so-called \"standing\" to sue.\n\nTrump's first executive order signed on Jan. 27 banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - for 90 days and halted refugee admission for four months, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely. Its hasty implementation caused chaos and protests at airports. The order was hit with more than two dozen lawsuits, many that claimed it discriminated against Muslims.\n\nThe new ban, which goes into effect on March 16, removes Iraq and adds categories of people who would be exempt from the order. The Trump administration said the executive order is necessary for national security reasons.\n\nIt also lists groups of people that could be eligible for waivers, including travelers who have previously been admitted to the United States for work or school, those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry; infants, young children and adoptees or people in need of medical care, employees of the U.S. government and international organizations among others.\n\nAll the exceptions make the new order \"a lot harder to attack,\" said Andrew Greenfield, an immigration attorney with Fragomen law firm in Washington D.C.\n\nTrump had promised to make the new directive harder to fight in court and many of the changes were expected.\n\n\"They dotted their 'i's' and crossed their 't's' in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor who specializes in immigration. He said opponents might still be able to find plaintiffs - a U.S. citizen could potentially sue if the government denies a waiver to their foreign spouse for an arbitrary reason, for example.\n\n'DO OUR HOMEWORK'\n\nIn a legal challenge to the original order, the state of Washington was successful in preventing it from being carried out. A federal judge in Seattle and then an appeals court in San Francisco ruled that Washington could claim standing, in part because the order adversely affected legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, in the state. More than 100 businesses, including many of the best-known tech companies, filed briefs in court that argued their employees were harmed.\n\nBob Ferguson, the Attorney General for Washington State said on Monday that he will likely decide on the next litigation steps this week after consulting with state universities and businesses about potential harms.\n\n\"We need to do our homework and be thoughtful about this,\" Ferguson said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, in a filing in Seattle federal court on Monday, said the new order applies \"only to those who are overseas and without a visa.\"\n\nForeign nationals outside the country who do not have a U.S. visa do not have the same protections under the U.S. Constitution as people already here, legal experts said.\n\nRosemary Jenks, the director of Government Relations at NumbersUSA, a conservative group that favors less immigration overall, said that the new order would leave the state of Washington having to argue on behalf of unidentified foreign nationals who have not been screened, vetted or processed yet by U.S. authorities.\n\n\"That would be a pretty big stretch,\" Jenks said. And unlike the old order, the new one lays out with more detail why the specific countries were selected, she said.\n\nAttorneys challenging the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union said there were still questions about whether or not the ban is justified by national security reasons and the revisions do not address concerns that the order discriminates based on religion.\n\nAdam Lauridsen, a Keker & Van Nest attorney in San Francisco representing students challenging Trump's first order, noted the revised directive still targets Muslim-majority countries.\n\nStephen Legomsky, chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the previous Obama administration, pointed to statements by Trump about wanting a Muslim ban.\n\n\"That evidence is baked in, you can't change the past,\" said Legomsky.

The House of Representatives is expected to unveil its legislation soon.\n\nUnder a Feb. 10 draft of the legislation made available to several news outlets, Republicans proposed offering an age-based refundable tax credit regardless of income level.

Critics also said extremely wealthy people would receive the credit even though they do not need it.\n\nIn the most recent version of the bill, the tax credits would only be available to those within certain income levels, according to Politico. They would start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and households earning $150,000, and would be unavailable for individuals who earn more than $215,000, Politico reported.\n\nRepublicans had also initially proposed capping exemptions on employer-provided health coverage, a provision that drew the ire of some conservatives who said the bill would remove Obamacare's taxes only to replace it with another.\n\nAccording to Politico, the latest version of the bill would not include a cap.

Crystal Cooper/ACLU of Virgina/Handout via REUTERS\n\nWASHINGTON Transgender students at U.S. public schools were left in legal limbo on Monday about whether a federal anti-discrimination law enables them to use the bathroom of their choice after the Supreme Court sidestepped a major ruling on the issue.\n\nIn canceling planned arguments in a bathroom access lawsuit brought by a Virginia transgender high school student, the justices declined to resolve whether transgender students are protected by a law, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, that bars discrimination on the basis of sex in education.\n\nBathroom access has become a key issue in the intensifying battle over transgender rights. North Carolina last year became the first state to require people to use bathrooms matching their gender at birth in public schools and government buildings. About a dozen other states are considering similar measures.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration last month rescinded guidance given to public schools last year by former President Barack Obama's administration to permit transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.\n\n\"We had emphasized this is an urgent situation for transgender students,\" said Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Gavin Grimm, the student who brought the case that the Supreme Court dodged.\n\nBlock said the justices' action, which threw out a lower court ruling favoring Grimm and instructed that court to reconsider the matter in light of the Trump administration's stance, was \"justice delayed not justice denied.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the question of whether Title IX protects transgender students will continue to be litigated in lower courts and mostly likely will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming years, perhaps as early as 2018.\n\nA handful of cases are pending in federal courts, including Grimm's, all of which could reach the Supreme Court. Courts are also set to decide the related legal question of whether school policies that limit access to bathrooms violate the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantee.\n\nIn Grimm's case, the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will now take a second shot. Its earlier ruling had been based on the Obama administration's interpretation, now reversed by Trump, that Title IX protects transgender students.\n\nThe 4th Circuit separately is due to hear arguments in May in a challenge brought to the North Carolina law, which still may be repealed following a public outcry against it.\n\nIn the most recent ruling, a federal district judge in Pennsylvania on Feb. 27 decided in favor of three transgender students who attend Pine-Richland High School in the Pittsburgh suburbs. The court ruled that the school's refusal to allow the students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity violated their constitutional rights.\n\nOther cases are pending in Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\n\"We expect and urge all schools to meet their moral and legal responsibility to fully respect and include their transgender students, as thousands of schools around the country have already been doing for years,\" Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality advocacy group, said after the high court's action.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council Christian conservative advocacy group, said the Supreme Court's action \"provided good news to parents and students concerned about privacy and safety in school showers, locker rooms and bathrooms.\"\n\n\"State and local officials working together with parents are best equipped to design policies that respect the dignity, privacy, and safety concerns of all students,\" Perkins said.\n\nBy the time the transgender bathroom issue returns, the Supreme Court, which has been down one justice for nearly 13 months, likely will have its full complement of nine justices. If Trump's high court nominee, conservative appellate judge Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, the court would once again have a conservative majority. Gorsuch's confirmation hearing is due to start on March 20.\n\nTransgender rights advocates remain hopeful that conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's regular swing vote who ruled in favor of gay marriage in 2015, will side with the court's liberals on upholding transgender rights.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-transgender-limbo-idUSKBN16D2ML"}, {"title": "Corker, critic of first Trump travel ban order, positive on new one", "text": "Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker speaks during the committee's confirmation hearing on Rex Tillerson's nomination to become U.S. Secretary of State on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 11, 2017.

Today, she cherishes the small, two-bedroom house she rents, with a yard where her children can safely play, away from drugs and gang violence in Dallas.\n\nBut if Daniels, 31, were to lose the $1,082 monthly stipend she receives, she has no doubt what would happen. \u201cI would have to move back,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nPulling Americans out of poverty is a subject close to Ryan\u2019s heart. And President Donald Trump has frequently talked about aiding the inner cities.\n\nBut the housing assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, could fall victim to fiscal policies under consideration by the White House and Congress, which include a massive tax cut and increased military spending, according to a dozen congressional aides who spoke to Reuters.\n\nWhile the White House has not been specific about its plans for HUD \u2014 the budget process remains in flux \u2014 it has called for a $54 billion cut in non-military discretionary domestic programs in the next fiscal year, which likely will dramatically impact safety-net programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security, budget experts said.\n\nAltogether, housing advocates paint a bleak picture of the landscape for low-income housing under the Trump administration. They warn that deep cuts to housing funds would force some people out of their homes and hollow out grant programs meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods.\n\nThere is also a ripple effect, they warn: Rental prices would likely rise alongside declines in affordable housing projects and vouchers available to renters. That would make it tougher for renters to save enough to eventually buy homes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad cycle,\u201d said Carol Galante, a former top HUD official during the Obama administration. \u201cIt puts pressure on the rental market. The rents are higher and higher so people can save less and less.\u201d\n\nIMAGE PROBLEMS\n\nHUD provides about 5 million Americans with some form of housing assistance, either through vouchers to renters, subsidies to landlords or public housing projects, which comprises about 85 percent of its budget. It also sends about $8 billion annually directly to communities through grants.\n\nEven so, only about one-quarter of those eligible for assistance in the country receive it.\n\nHousing advocates say changes to its budget or mandate would be directly felt in low-income communities. They point out that in 2013, when the legislatively mandated budget cuts known as sequestration hit HUD, more than 100,000 renters nationwide lost their housing support.\n\nDouglas Rice, an expert at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, estimates that for every 1 percent cut in HUD\u2019s budget, 20,000 renters would lose their assistance\n\nBut critics of the agency, including some Republican lawmakers, say its anti-poverty and community-development programs are inefficient and wasteful, and that it has failed to live up to its mission. Today, the proportion of Americans who live below the poverty line \u2014 14.5 percent \u2014 is about the same as it was 35 years ago.\n\nHUD has also at times had difficulty shaking the image of a bureaucratic agency that is vulnerable to corruption. It was at the center of a bid-rigging scandal during the Reagan Administration. And Alphonso Jackson, the HUD secretary under President George W. Bush, resigned in 2008 amid allegations that he steered contracts to friends. Charges were never brought against Jackson.\n\n\u201cThere are some sports teams that never seem to gel. I think we\u2019re a little like that at HUD,\u201d said Bud Albright, a Washington lobbyist who worked at the agency when Republican Jack Kemp was secretary in the early 1990s.\n\nTrump, who has not been specific on his plans for the agency, selected Ben Carson to lead HUD. The former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate won Senate confirmation last week.\n\nAlthough Carson's views hew closely to Republican orthodoxy on how too much government can discourage people from working hard, his upbringing in inner-city Detroit gives him a unique perspective: his mother received food stamps to provide for her family and he was raised around housing assistance programs similar to those he will now manage.\n\nCarson, who declined requests for interviews by Reuters, has pledged to fight to protect HUD\u2019s housing-assistance budget and preserve the agency\u2019s community-development initiatives. He also said he would push to include funding to rehabilitate public-housing facilities in Trump\u2019s proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\n\nBut given the White House's determination to cut domestic spending, Carson will have to fight for every dollar.

Hensarling plans to introduce legislation this year to narrow the $1 trillion portfolio of the Federal Housing Administration, which helps low-income and first-time homebuyers purchase homes, his office said.\n\nHensarling has said he fears that if home values drop the FHA would require another federal bailout as it did in 2013, when it received a taxpayer-funded infusion of $1.7 billion to cover its losses.\n\nIf the cuts to HUD\u2019s budget are as severe as some expect, those who are on waiting lists now for vouchers will be staying on them for a very long time, and recipients such as Shiva Daniels, who has been receiving assistance for six years, will be at risk of seeing that support end.\n\nThat would mean losing her small house, with the yard she sees as a safe haven for her children. \u201cIt might not feel like it\u2019s a big deal, but it is,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWhen you feel good, it allows you to do better, and do better for them.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Jason Szep and Paul Thomasch)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-housing-idUSKBN16C0JG"}, {"title": "U.S. Republicans expected to unveil healthcare bill this week", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump arrives aboard Air Force One, returning to Washington from a weekend in Florida, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S. March 5, 2017.

Last year, the group said it received about two requests a month for guardianship letters and notarization services.\n\nAt the request of a nonprofit organization, the National Lawyers Guild in Washington D.C. put out a call this week for volunteer attorneys to help immigrants fill out forms granting friends or relatives the right to make legal and financial decisions in their absence.\n\nIn New Jersey, immigration attorney Helen Ramirez said she is getting about six phone calls a day from parents. Last year, she said, she had no such calls.\n\n\"Their biggest fear is that their kids will end up in foster care,\" Ramirez said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has issued directives to agents to more aggressively enforce immigration laws and more immigrants are coming under scrutiny by the authorities.\n\nFor parents of U.S. citizens who are ordered removed, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency \"accommodates, to the extent practicable, the parents' efforts to make provisions\" for their children, said ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez. She said that might include access to a lawyer, consular officials and relatives for detained parents to execute powers of attorney or apply for passports and buy airline tickets if the parents decide whether or not to take the children with them.\n\nRandy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based non-profit that analyzes the movement of people worldwide, said that while putting contingency plans in place is a good idea, he does not think the level of fear is justified.\n\nDuring the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, the likelihood of both parents being deported was slim, Capps said.\n\nHe doubts there will be a huge shift under Republican Trump toward deporting both parents.\n\n\"The odds are still very low but not as low as they were \u2013 and this is just the beginning of the administration,\" he said.\n\nAbout five million children under the age of 18 are living with at least one parent who is in the country illegally, according to a 2016 study by MPI. Most of the children, 79 percent, were U.S. citizens, the study found.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, ICE removed 15,422 parents who said they have at least one U.S.-born child, according to ICE data.\n\nObama was criticized for being the \"deporter in chief\" after he expelled more than 400,000 people in 2012, the most by any president in a single year. In 2014, the Obama administration began focusing on a narrower slice of immigrants, those who had recently entered the country or committed serious felonies. Trump has said he would still prioritize criminals for deportation.\n\n'WORRIED ALL THE TIME'\n\nIn rural New Jersey, Seidy Martinez and her husband Jose Gomez have begun the difficult conversations with their 10-year-old daughter about what would happen if her parents were deported.\n\nMartinez, a house cleaner, and Gomez, who works on a horse farm, are both from Honduras. They entered the United States illegally, and do not have papers, unlike their daughter, who has been granted asylum, and their 3-year-old son, a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"Now we are worried all the time. We don't have anything that would allow us to stay here,\" said Martinez. \"Our main concern is what will happen to our children.\"\n\nShe has told her daughter that she could live with her aunt in Miami and is considering drafting paperwork that would give her relative some legal rights if she and her husband are deported. The 10-year old tries to comfort her mother. \"She tells me, 'Mami, tranquila.

Children would be put into protective custody with the Department of Health and Human Services, in the \"least restrictive setting\" until they can be taken into the care of a U.S. relative or state-sponsored guardian.\n\nCurrently, families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the United States until their cases are resolved. A federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for ending \"catch and release,\" in which migrants who cross illegally are freed to live in the United States while awaiting legal proceedings.\n\nTwo of the officials were briefed on the proposal at a Feb. 2 town hall for asylum officers by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum chief John Lafferty.\n\nA third DHS official said the department is actively considering separating women from their children but has not made a decision.\n\nHHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, DHS said: \"The journey north is a dangerous one with too many situations where children - brought by parents, relatives or smugglers - are often exploited, abused or may even lose their lives.\n\n\"With safety in mind, the Department of Homeland Security continually explores options that may discourage those from even beginning the journey,\" the statement said.\n\nU.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes about 200 miles (320 km) of the border with Mexico, slammed the proposal. \"Bottom line: separating mothers and children is wrong,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"That type of thing is where we depart from border security and get into violating human rights,\" he said.\n\nAbout 54,000 children and their guardians were apprehended between Oct. 1, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2017, more than double the number caught over the same time period a year earlier.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have argued women are willing to risk the dangerous journey with their children because they are assured they will be quickly released from detention and given court dates set years into the future.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates have argued that Central America's violent and impoverished conditions force mothers to immigrate to the United States and that they should be given asylum status. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2m4aPAs)\n\nLEGAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nImplementing the new policy proposal \"could create lifelong psychological trauma,\" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director at the National Immigration Law Center. \"Especially for children that have just completed a perilous journey from Central America.\"\n\nHincapie said the U.S. government is likely to face legal challenges based on immigration and family law if they decide to implement the policy.\n\nThe policy would allow DHS to detain parents while complying with a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals order from July 2016 that immigrant children should be released from detention as quickly as possible. That order said their parents were not required to be freed.\n\nTo comply with that order, the Obama administration implemented a policy of holding women and children at family detention centers for no more than 21 days before releasing them.\n\nHolding mothers in prolonged detention could also strain government resources, said Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based non-profit.\n\n\u201cYou are talking about a pretty rapid increase in the detention population if you are going to do this,\" Capps said. \"The question is really how much detention can they afford.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last week ordered immigration agents to deport or criminally prosecute parents who facilitate the illegal smuggling of their children.\n\nMany parents who arrive on the U.S.-Mexico border with their children have paid smugglers to guide them across the dangerous terrain.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley; Additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg and Susan Cornwell; Editing by Sue Horton, Ross Colvin, James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children-idUSKBN16A2ES"}, {"title": "Pence says his private email use was not the same as Clinton's", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday said there was \"no comparison whatsoever\" between his use of a private email account for state business while he was governor of Indiana and the email woes of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton's use of a private email server during her time in government became a major point of criticism against her as the Democratic nominee during the 2016 presidential election by Pence, the running mate of President Donald Trump, and others involved in the Republican campaign.\n\n\"There's no comparison whatsoever between Hillary Clinton's practice, having a private server that was handling classified information, destroying emails that were requested by the Congress and by officials,\" Pence told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Wisconsin.\n\nPence's use of an AOL email account was first reported by the Indianapolis Star on Thursday.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin used his first senior staff meeting last month to tell his new aides he would not tolerate leaks to the news media, three sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nCurrent and former officials said that in a departure from past practice, access to a classified computer system at the White House has been tightened by political appointees to prevent some professional staffers from seeing memos being prepared for the new president.\n\nAnd at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), some officials told Reuters they believe a search is under way for the leaker of a draft intelligence report which found little evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries covered by Trump's now-suspended travel ban pose a threat to the United States.\n\nWashington career civil servants say the clampdown appears designed to try to limit the flow of information inside and outside government agencies charged with foreign policy and national security and to deter officials from talking to the media about topics that could result in negative stories.\n\nThe White House did not immediately comment on Friday about why it is trying to crack down on leaks.\n\nTrump, who has been infuriated by some news reports of government dysfunction, has expressed his intention to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the media.\n\n\"We're going to find the leakers. They're going to pay a big price for leaking,\" he said in response to a reporter\u2019s question during a meeting with lawmakers on Feb. 16. At a news conference the same day, Trump said he had asked the Department of Justice to look into leaks of \"classified information that was given illegally\" to journalists regarding contacts between some of his aides and Russian officials.\n\nSeveral officials in different government agencies who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said some employees fear their phone calls and emails may be monitored and that they are reluctant to speak their minds during internal discussions. Reuters has no independent evidence of this happening.\n\nIn another effort to deter leaks, White House spokesman Sean Spicer demanded that some aides there surrender their phones so they could be checked for calls or texts to reporters, Politico reported on Sunday.\n\nWord of the inspection quickly leaked.\n\nTrump said later he supported Spicer. He added \u201cI would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way and I\u2019m OK with it,\" he said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nOn Friday, Spicer did not respond to requests for comment on his reasons for demanding the phones from his staff.\n\nEFFORTS TO PLUG LEAKS NOT NEW\n\nTwo sources familiar with Mnuchin's first meeting with senior Treasury staff said he told them that their telephone calls and emails could be monitored to prevent leaks. One of the sources said that staff were told that monitoring could become \"policy.\"\n\nAsked about Mnuchin's comments to his senior staff, a Treasury spokesman said: \"Secretary Mnuchin had a discussion with staff about confidential information not being shared with the media nor any other sources. In the course of that conversation, the idea of checking phones was not discussed.\"\n\nAsked in a follow-up email whether Mnuchin had raised the possibility of monitoring phones or emails as a matter of policy, the Treasury spokesman replied: \"It was not discussed.\"\n\nAttempts by Republican and Democratic presidents to limit leaks are not new.\n\nDuring Republican Richard Nixon's administration, the FBI wiretapped White House aides and journalists. Trump's predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, aggressively pursued leaks to try to \"control the narrative,\" as White House aides put it.\n\nNew York Times reporter James Risen, whose articles led to investigations of leaks, said the Obama administration prosecuted nine cases involving whistleblowers and leakers, compared with three by all previous administrations combined.\n\nLeonard Downie, a former executive editor of the Washington Post, said it was too early to make historical comparisons. He said it is rare to learn about an administration's internal efforts to impose message discipline.\n\n'CLIMATE OF INTIMIDATION'\n\nAt the State Department, the fear of getting caught in a leak investigation or running afoul of White House positions is so acute that some officials will discuss issues only face-to-face rather than use phones, email, texts or other messaging applications, two State Department officials said.\n\n\"There is a climate of intimidation, not just about talking to reporters, but also about communicating with colleagues,\" said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nActing State Department spokesman Mark Toner did not respond directly to the officials' statements but said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed to foster an open climate where new ideas are raised and considered on their merits.\n\n\"There does have to be some degree of trust among colleagues in order to have those kinds of conversations,\" Toner said.\n\nThere also is high anxiety in parts of DHS, three officials there said.\n\nThey said some officials fear phone calls and emails are being monitored to try to find who leaked the draft intelligence report to the Associated Press. Reuters has no independent evidence that this is the case.\n\nThe report found that being a citizen of countries covered by Trump's Jan. 27 temporary immigration ban - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - was \"an unreliable indicator of terrorist threat.\"\n\nThe DHS did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nBefore Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, National Security Council officials drafting memos, or \"packages,\" for the president on a classified computer system could choose other officials who should have input, several current and former officials said.\n\nUnder a change made after Trump took office, staffers now cannot choose who may see and edit a memo. Instead, access is approved by the office of the NSC executive secretary, retired Army lieutenant general Keith Kellogg.\n\nAsked about the new restrictions, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said: \"President Trump takes very seriously the criminal release of classified information critical to U.S. national security. Access procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate personnel see material relevant to their duties, while protecting sensitive information.\"\n\nOne U.S. official called the new system \"inefficient,\" saying Kellogg's office may not know who has a stake in any given issue and may not share the drafts widely enough.\n\nSteven Aftergood of the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, which works to limit official secrecy, said the policy change suggested the White House wants to tighten control over internal deliberations. He said restricting access to information adds friction to the decision-making process and predicted that \u201cinferior policy decisions are a likely result.\u201d\n\nSpicer did not immediately comment on Friday on whether the new procedure might harm policy-making.\n\nAn administration official said the White House changed the access procedures about a month ago in reaction to leaks of the contents of Trump's conversations with the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Australia.\n\nAsked if the change had made the NSC less efficient, this official replied: \"No, because we are being conscientious about ensuring that all relevant staff members and experts are included on materials that they need to see.\"\n\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel Additional reporting by John Walcott, Julia Edwards Ainsley, Steve Holland, David Lawder and Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-secrecy-exclusive-idUSKBN16A0GD"}, {"title": "U.S. State Department criticized over quiet release of human rights report", "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a statement after a meeting with Mexico's Foreign Secretary Videgaray (not pictured) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Mexico City, Mexico, February 23, 2017.

Wind stocks are attractive as that energy source is proving more cost-effective in growing areas of the country like California, which plans to get half its energy from renewable sources by 2030.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where the policy is changing the fastest, it's at the state level, and we see places like California continuing on that trend regardless of what is happening on the federal level,\u201d said Kevin Walenta, who manages the Fidelity Select Environment and Alternative Energy portfolio.

Coal power, which Trump has pledged to revive, costs between $60 and $143 per megawatt hour, the report notes.\n\nWith that cost structure, along with the potential increase in jobs from building and maintaining wind turbines, even solidly Republican states should continue to invest in renewables, said Murray Rosenblith, co-portfolio manager of the New Alternatives Fund.\n\nRosenblith has been adding to his positions in wind companies Vestas Wind Systems and Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA, both of whose shares are up 10 percent or more since the start of the year.\n\n\"These are growing industries in states that are bringing back jobs,\" he said. \"Even if Trump wants to pull tax credits back as a political gesture he's not going to find a lot of support in the party at large.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Randall, Ross Kerber and Nichola Groom; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and David Gregorio)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-trump-sustainable-idUSKBN16A29A"}, {"title": "New Interior chief vows review of Obama-era rules, 'bold' restructuring", "text": "New Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tips his cowboy hat after riding in on horseback with a U.S. Park Police horse mounted unit reporting for his first day of work at the Interior Department in Washington, U.S., March 2, 2017.

The Kremlin has denied the allegations.\n\nSessions denied he had contact with Russian officials when he was asked directly during his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with Russian operatives during the election campaign.\n\nHe told reporters he was \"honest and correct\" in his response, although he acknowledged he \"should have slowed down\" and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator.\n\n\"I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,\" Sessions said, adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday night, Trump said Sessions \"did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\"\n\nSessions' meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were disclosed on Wednesday night by the Washington Post. Sessions received Kislyak in his Senate office in September and also met him in July at a Heritage Foundation event at the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors.\n\nTrump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and that Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.\n\nThe recusal means Sessions, a powerful member of Trump's inner circle, will not be briefed on details of any probe. Should the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to move forward with charges, Sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should take the case.\n\nCALLS TO RESIGN\n\nHouse of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi urged Sessions to resign and said \"his narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury\" were inadequate.\n\nAdam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Sessions' explanation for failing to tell the Senate about his meetings \"is simply not credible.\" He called on Sessions to step down and said the Justice Department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian interference.\n\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to launch a criminal investigation into Sessions' statements to Congress about his communication with Russian officials.\n\nSessions is one of many \"subjects\" of a government investigation of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, two U.S. officials familiar with the probe said.\n\nThe officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sessions was not now a \"target\" of the probe by the FBI, the Treasury Department, the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\nThe investigation, one of the officials said, had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of Trump, including Flynn, and the Russian Embassy in Washington as well as Russian and some Ukrainian businessmen and companies.\n\nAt least two other officials in Trump's campaign said they also spoke with the Russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the July convention last July, USA Today reported on Thursday.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner also met with Kislyak in December at Trump Tower in New York, an administration official said on Thursday, confirming a report in the New Yorker.\n\nWhile there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the White House's repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with Russian officials beyond those by Flynn.\n\nTrump has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. The White House dismissed the disclosure of the Sessions meetings as a partisan attack, saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the Armed Services Committee.\n\nTrump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia, drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Ties with Russia have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow's military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putin's intolerance of political dissent.\n\nWith his administration on the defensive over Russia, Trump's enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about Moscow.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington, shrugging off the uproar, said on Thursday it was in regular contact with \"U.S. partners.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Ayesha Rascoe, Steve Holland, Julia Edwards Ainsely, Patricia Zengerle and John Walcott)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sessions-idUSKBN16908L"}, {"title": "Trump says wants defense buildup to project U.S. power abroad", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks aboard the pre-commissioned U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Gerald R.

The Navy currently has 10.\n\n\"I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including the 12 (aircraft)-carrier Navy we need,\" Trump said, receiving applause.\n\n\"We also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities and greater force levels,\" he said. \"Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities.\"\n\nThere are questions about how the increase in the budget will be spread across the different service branches and which weapons programs will get priority.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he would increase the Army's troop strength and increase the number of ships in the Navy to 350 from about 275 ships. The timeline and the exact cost of the buildup is unclear.\n\nTrump said the Navy will \"soon be the largest it's been.\"\n\nThe U.S. Navy peaked at 6,768 ships in 1945 at the end of World War Two and by 1990 it still had 570 ships, even though the ships now are more advanced and capable.\n\n\"We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world,\" he said. \"We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing.

Congress would be unlikely to approve a proposal to cut all staff in a diesel emissions program, for example.\n\nScott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, told U.S. mayors on Thursday he would make a priority of cleanups of industrial and hazardous waste sites and improving water infrastructure, even as the White House proposed severe proposed cuts to those programs.\n\n\"In this budget discussion that is ongoing with Congress that is just starting, there are some concerns about some of these grant programs that EPA has been a part of historically,\" Pruitt said.\n\n\"I want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program and the water infrastructure grants and state revolving funds are essential to protect,\" he said.\n\nGreenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols said: \"As a candidate, Trump made a big deal out of EPA's failure in Flint, but now he's cutting 30 percent out of lead cleanup in his proposed budget. This is an example of his empty promises to do right by the American people.\"\n\nOfficers of the Environmental Council of the States, composed of local regulators, raised concerns to the White House and EPA about the budget process, which they said lacked input by directly affected states.\n\nECOS officers will meet with the environment team of the Office and Management and Budget, a White House office, on Friday and have slated a teleconference with Pruitt in March.\n\nECOS head Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said states had been hopeful after Pruitt's confirmation hearing that they would get resources to do their work. \"Now they are feeling very vulnerable,\u201d she said.\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-budget-idUSKBN1692XA"}, {"title": "Trump's 'bromance' with Russia's Putin appears to be cooling", "text": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump (L-R), joined by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisor Steve Bannon, Communications Director Sean Spicer and then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, speaks by phone with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 28, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON With his administration on the defensive over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's election, U.S. President Donald Trump is no longer tweeting praise for his Kremlin counterpart.\n\nLess than five weeks after he took office, the chances of a spring thaw in relations between Washington and Moscow \u2013 once buoyed by an apparent \"bromance\" between Trump and President Vladimir Putin during the U.S. political campaign \u2013 are looking much dimmer, U.S. officials say.\n\nHis top foreign policy advisers have started talking tougher on Russia, and the apparent cooling of Trump's approach follows the resignation last month of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a vocal advocate of warmer ties with Moscow. He was replaced by Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who is more hawkish on Russia and allied with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general.\n\nIn one other sign of a stiffening attitude, two officials said the administration had offered the job of top Russia adviser at the National Security Council to Russia scholar Fiona Hill, a leading Putin critic. Her books include \"Mr. Putin, Operative in the Kremlin\", an allusion to the Russian leader's past as a KGB officer. It was not immediately known whether she had accepted the post.\n\nPressure also has come to bear from Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, long wary of his campaign overtures to Putin, and from European allies anxious over any sign that the president might prematurely ease sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.\n\nPosing fresh obstacles to rapprochement with Russia, analysts say, is mounting evidence that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other members of Trump's team communicated with Russian officials during and after the presidential campaign.\n\nThe mushrooming inquiry - which is now focused on Sessions and his contacts with Moscow's ambassador to Washington - has fueled calls for expanded investigations into allegations that Moscow sought to sway the election's outcome.\n\n\"There is so much panic in the U.S. political establishment over Russia right now that Trump will be boxed in on what he can do,\" said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.\n\nWhite House officials say there were no improper contacts, and Russia denies any meddling.\n\nNO SWIFT WARMING OF TIES EXPECTED\n\nWhile Trump has yet to lay down his Russia policy, most signs suggest no swift changes in the relationship, which sank to a post-Cold War low under his predecessor Barack Obama, mostly due to bitter differences over Syria and Ukraine.\n\nMattis sought to reassure NATO allies during a visit to Europe last month, telling them there would be no military cooperation between the United States and Russia in the near future.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley this week denounced Russia for casting a veto to protect the Syrian government from Security Council action over accusations of chemical weapons use, and also recently insisted the United States would not recognize Russia's seizure of Crimea.\n\nTrump's openness to closer ties to Russia and his emphasis, particularly during the campaign, on fighting terrorism sparked concerns among current and former U.S. officials that he might trade away U.S. interests in other areas in exchange for military and intelligence cooperation against groups such as Islamic State.\n\nTrump's language on Russia now has shifted somewhat from campaign days, when he tweeted his admiration for Putin as a strong leader, and the Russian president paid him compliments.\n\nTrump told a news conference in mid-February that, \"I would love to be able to get along with Russia,\" but added that, \"It's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\"\n\nTwo senior European officials this week told reporters in Washington they discerned an evolution in the Trump administration's stance toward Russia, saying there appeared to be no desire to engage in such a \"grand bargain\" in which, for example, Ukraine-related sanctions might be eased in return for Russian action on other issues.\n\n\"What we consider reassuring is that, at least during our meetings, nobody came with this idea of a grand bargain, with the idea of a big deal,\" said one senior European official on condition of anonymity.\n\nSaid a second senior European official: \"Vis-a-vis Russia, to be frank I have the impression that the analysis and the positions of this administration are probably now closer to our position than (they) may have been two or three months ago.\"\n\nRecent Russian actions have created new complications, including a stepped-up offensive by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and what the Pentagon described as the bombing this week by Russian and Syrian aircraft of U.S.-backed Syrian rebels \u2013 something Moscow denied had happened.\n\nFor its part, the Kremlin said on Wednesday it was patiently waiting for \"some kind of actions\" from the Trump administration so that it could understand what the future holds for relations.\n\n\"We have heard different statements from President Trump,\" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters.\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee and former 2016 presidential candidate, had words of caution for Trump about future dealings with Putin.\n\n\"We have had two presidents - a Republican and a Democrat - previous to the current president who thought they could do such a deal with Vladimir Putin,\" he said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.\n\n\"Both of them fell on their face because they did not\n\nunderstand what they were dealing with.

States could choose to expand Medicaid to any income level at or below 138 percent and retain enhanced federal funding for the program.\n\nThe proposal would also give states more flexibility in how they manage their Medicaid programs and cap spending for certain populations.\n\nHouse Republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal and many say it will not be in place before 2019.\n\nOn Thursday, a draft Obamacare repeal bill by the House Republicans was available for Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to read in a room on Capitol Hill but was not publicly released.

Gutierrez is of Puerto Rican descent and has worked in the past with Republicans on immigration legislation.\n\nSome prominent Republicans said progress on the first major immigration reform since 1986 was still possible.\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, who helped win Senate passage in 2013 of a sweeping bipartisan immigration law rewrite that subsequently died in the House, said of Trump's upbeat remarks: \"I would hope that would open the door for negotiations and support\" for legislation.\n\nSenator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who joined with McCain and others in 2013, said if there was an opportunity to go forward, Trump would likely want to pair bills that would be supported by opposing sides in the immigration debate.\n\nFor example, Flake speculated, the president might support putting into law temporary protections shielding \"dreamers\" from deportation - people who entered the United States as children.

McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security chief John Kelly all made the case to Trump to remove Iraq because of ongoing U.S. military and civilian operations in the country, according to three U.S. officials who said the Cabinet members made the case separately at recent meetings.\n\nAn administration official said the new executive order would likely exclude Iraq. Another U.S. official said the State Department was confident Iraq would not appear, while a congressional aide said Iraq would be removed following conversations among White House advisers on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked whether Iraq would be left out of the revised order, the White House said it did not have any announcements on the executive order right now.\n\nA White House official said the order was likely to come on Monday.\n\nFederal courts blocked Trump's Jan. 27 executive order that temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nTrump has said the travel limitations were necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. Americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but stirred national protests and were condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies.\n\nThere are currently 5,200 American troops deployed in Iraq to assist Iraqi and Kurdish forces in retaking Mosul - the last city in Iraq under the control of Islamic State militants.\n\nIraqis have fought alongside U.S. troops for years and have worked as translators.

He called for national unity and avoided a repeat of his attacks on Democratic opponents and media organizations.\n\nPolls conducted immediately after the speech showed a clear majority of Americans approved of the softer approach and aides described Trump as buoyed by the reception.\n\nA senior White House official said Ivanka Trump made recommendations for the speech during a brainstorming session in the Oval Office on Sunday, helping her father decide on a new approach aimed at easing concerns over whether he had the right temperament to govern effectively.\n\n\"He had a lot of voices around him giving him ideas and suggestions that he incorporated, but he really set out to achieve that optimistic tone and that was something she was supportive of. She encouraged him to do that,\" one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"She had a role,\" said another. \"She helped set the tone.\"\n\nIvanka Trump also persuaded her father to speak favorably about affordable child care and paid family leave, policies she has long backed and which could draw support from Democrats in Congress, said another official with some knowledge of how the speech evolved.\n\n\"Her fingerprints are visible on the tone, but especially on those parts of it like maternity leave that matter to her,\" the official said.\n\n'REACHING OUT'\n\nIvanka Trump, 35, the president's older daughter, has emerged as an influential informal adviser for her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities.\n\nAfter his election victory last November, she stepped away from her business interests in New York to move to Washington and is frequently seen at her father's events.\n\nA White House official said Trump was the principal author of the speech but had a lot of help in drafting it, including from his daughter.\n\nTrump made the final changes to his speech during a marathon session on Tuesday, working closely with Vice President Mike Pence, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief speechwriter Stephen Miller.\n\nIvanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior White House adviser with particular interest in trade deals and Middle East diplomacy.\n\nThe couple have been among the president's closest confidants since his election campaign, and Kushner also helped in the drafting of the speech to Congress.\n\nOthers involved in the last round of deliberations were White House aides Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON President Donald Trump told Congress on Tuesday he was open to immigration reform, shifting from his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration in a speech that offered a more restrained tone than his election campaign and first month in the White House.\n\nTrump, in a prime-time address to a country that remains divided over his leadership, set aside disputes with Democrats and the news media to deliver his most presidential performance to date, seeking to regain the confidence of Americans rattled by his leadership thus far.\n\nThe president's speech was long on promises but short on specifics on how to achieve a challenging legislative agenda that could add dramatically to budget deficits. He wants a healthcare overhaul, broad tax cuts and a $1 trillion public-private initiative to rebuild degraded roads and bridges.\n\nTrump built a base of support behind his presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration. In his speech, he took a more moderate tone, appealing to Republicans and Democrats to work together on immigration reform.\n\nHe said it was possible if both Republicans and Democrats in Congress were willing to compromise, although he also said U.S. immigration should be based on a merit-based system, rather than relying on lower-skilled immigrants.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform eluded his two predecessors, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W. Bush, because of deep divisions within Congress and among Americans over the issue. Trump said reform would raise wages and help more struggling families enter the middle class.\n\n\"I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws,\" said the Republican president.\n\nTrump's first month in office was dominated by a fight over his temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations, repeated attacks on the news media and harsh personal criticism of judges who blocked his immigration order.\n\nIn his speech on Tuesday, he appeared to look for a reset, trying to move past a chaotic period that sowed doubts about his ability to govern effectively.\n\n\"The time for trivial fights is behind us,\" he said.\n\nPARTISAN DIVIDE\n\nFinancial markets showed a muted reaction as Trump gave few specifics or new details.\n\nEarly signs showed Trump's speech drew a positive response. A CNN/ORC poll found 57 percent of viewers thought Trump's speech was very positive and 69 percent said they felt more optimistic about the future of the country.\n\n\"He's lost his foot and mouth disease,\" said Tom Beckwith, 71, of Seminole, Florida. \"This was a tremendous speech. He's cured.\"\n\nStill, there was plenty of evidence of ongoing partisan divisions. In the chamber of the House of Representatives where Trump spoke, Democrats sometimes sat in silence and turned their thumbs down at his remarks. Many women lawmakers wore white in a subtle show of protest.\n\nDemocratic Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware called Trump's speech one of \"the most coherent public addresses he's given in a month.\"\n\nBut Coons said he viewed Trump\u2019s forthcoming budget proposals as \u201cgravely concerning,\" citing the president's plan for paying for a defense buildup by cutting foreign aid and other programs.\n\nMuch of Trump's speech focused on solving problems at home in line with his \"America first\" rhetoric. Apart from criticizing Obama for increasing the national debt, Trump did not mention the federal budget deficit, which will severely limit any new spending programs.\n\nOn immigration, Trump again pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, but he made no mention this time of Mexico paying for it. He also said he would \u201cshortly take new steps to keep our nation safe,\u201d referring to a new executive order he is to sign to replace one embroiled in the courts.\n\nTrump focused part of the speech on foreign policy, stressing his support for NATO but insisting allies pay more for their defense.\n\nIn a possible nod to his bid to warm relations with Russia, which he did not mention by name, Trump said: \"America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.\"\n\nTrump has been criticized for his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A U.S. congressional committee is investigating contacts between Trump's election campaign and Russia to see if there were any inappropriate communications.\n\n\"We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict,\" said Trump, who said, however, he would embark on a big defense buildup.\n\n'MASSIVE TAX RELIEF'\n\nTrump said he wanted to provide \"massive tax relief\" to the middle class and cut corporate tax rates. But he did not offer specifics and failed to comment on the most pressing tax issue facing Congress, a proposed border adjustment tax to boost exports over imports.\n\nLawmakers have been looking to Trump for more leadership on an issue that has divided corporate America and Republicans in Congress.\n\nTrump called on the Republican-led Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access and lower costs.\n\nRepublicans remain divided on how to accomplish that goal and Democrats vehemently oppose tampering with a system that provides health insurance for millions of low-income Americans.\n\nWhile Trump's comments lacked detail, it was the first time he publicly supported tax credits to help Americans purchase their own coverage, a nod to health insurers who say they are necessary to keep people in the market.\n\nFormer Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear said in the Democratic response to Trump's speech that \"you and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health insurance away from millions of Americans who most need it.\"\n\nIn the most emotional moment of the night, Trump singled out Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed in a raid on al Qaeda in Yemen.\n\nOwens, tears streaming down her face, clasped her hands and looked upward from her spot in the balcony as lawmakers and the president applauded her in the longest ovation of Trump's hour-long speech.\n\nTrump said the mission that her husband participated in obtained vital intelligence that could be used against Islamist militants, taking issue with news reports quoting U.S. officials who said little was gained from the raid.\n\n(Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, Ayesha Rascoe, Jeff Mason, Emily Stephenson, Doina Chiacu in Washington, Megan Davies in New York and Letitia Stein in Clearwater, Fla.; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-idUSKBN167174"}, {"title": "New Trump travel order expected in coming days, Pence says", "text": "International travelers arrive at Logan Airport following a federal court's temporary stay of U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. February 6, 2017.

He must also ensure the issue does not complicate his relations with Trump.\n\n\"We are talking with our counterparts in the United States to ensure that we're addressing this situation properly,\" Trudeau told reporters in Calgary, Alberta.\n\nSecurity experts have said the asylum-seekers could pose a threat if the flow picks up once the weather improves and authorities do not take additional steps.\n\nCanadian and U.S. officials speak daily about the border crossers and law enforcement agencies from both nations met in Montreal last month to plot strategies, the source said.\n\nThe U.S. side asked Canada to provide details of the asylum seekers, in particular, how they had entered the United States and what their status was there.\n\nThe Montreal summit grouped representatives from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canada Border Services Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.\n\nRCMP spokeswoman Annie Delisle confirmed the meeting took place, and said the two sides agreed on an \"action plan which outlines a collaborative approach to dealing with the influx\".\n\nAn official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the crossings were very limited and did not represent a major security concern.\n\n\"Frankly, it is far more embarrassing to this country than it is threatening,\" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official, and a second person directly involved in border affairs, said U.S. authorities had not mounted a major effort to beef up border security, in part because they lack manpower and equipment.\n\nA senior Canadian security source classified the risk as medium- to long-term, since it was likely that those crossing the border really were seeking asylum.\n\nVast stretches of the 5,500-mile (8,900-km) frontier are unguarded and the more images spread of people walking across, the more vulnerable Canada could become, said the source.\n\n\"If we keep this up for a while, and it becomes known that the border really is porous, then people will use it as an opportunity to put (operatives) in,\" said the source.\n\nExact numbers are hard to calculate, since not all authorities release details. In January and February, 143 people walked illegally over the border into Manitoba, local police said.\n\nAs of Feb. 13, some 3,800 people had made an asylum claim in 2017, up from the same period last year, said Bardsley. That number, though, includes all people seeking asylum, and the government would not break down the figures.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ethan Lou in Calgary and John Walcott in Washington; Editing by Chris Reese and Sandra Maler)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-canada-idUSKBN16856W"}, {"title": "Pompe drug lauded by Trump costs $300,000 a year", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump addresses Joint Session of Congress - Washington, U.S. - 28/02/17 - Megan Crowley listens as U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the U.S. Congress.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Congress on Tuesday that more needs to be done to bring down \"artificially high\" prices for prescription drugs, while at the same time praising a drug that turns out to cost $300,000 per year.\n\nDuring the televised address, Trump acknowledged in the audience Megan Crowley, a college student who has Pompe disease - a rare muscle disorder that can be treated with an expensive enzyme replacement therapy.\n\n\"But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need,\" the president said. \"If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\"\n\nTrump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging \"astronomical\" prices, while acknowledging how \"complicated\" the nation's healthcare system is.\n\nRepresentatives of the Trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for Pompe disease is fair.\n\nTrump's comments on Tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors - the potential for deregulation of the FDA, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products.\n\n\"I think Trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,\" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. \"The FDA's standards actually promote innovation because patients don't want just any old drug - they want drugs that work.\"\n\nMegan's father, John Crowley, now chief executive at Amicus Therapeutics Inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for Pompe disease.\n\nIn 2006, the FDA - after a nine-month review - approved infused enzyme replacement therapy Myozyme for patients born with the condition. A similar drug, Lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late-onset Pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient's age.\n\nThe average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to Paris-based Sanofi SA, which now owns the drugs.\n\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases - defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients - are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity. \"Pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don't for mainstream diseases,\" said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauded Trump's recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.\n\n\"Our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,\" NORD said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nPompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. When glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death.\n\nNORD estimates that around 30 million Americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.\n\n(Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drugpricing-idUSKBN1685W5"}, {"title": "Senate Democrats seek Trump tax returns", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump departs after delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress from the floor of the House of Representatives iin Washington, U.S., February 28, 2017.

Democrats and other critics contend that the documents could show whether his global business empire poses any conflicts of interest as the president moves his agenda forward on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations.\n\nIn a letter dated Wednesday, seven Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee urged the panel's Republican chairman, Orrin Hatch, to request the documents from the U.S. Treasury so that lawmakers can review them in a closed session and determine whether the returns can be released to the public.\n\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives said they planned to pose a similar request on Thursday to Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers, including House Republicans Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Walter Jones of North Carolina.\n\nThe Democratic efforts face long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress. Three attempts in the House have met with defeat this year.\n\nHatch and Brady responded to the Senate request in a joint letter saying Democrats were suggesting \"an abuse of the tax-writing committees' statutory authority\" that would set \"a dangerous precedent\".\n\nDemocrats say they hope to create a bipartisan juggernaut to require the disclosure of Trump's and future presidents' tax returns by pushing forward on multiple fronts.\n\nOn Monday, the House voted down a Democratic effort seeking the Republican president's returns, with Sanford and Jones voting \"present\" rather than opposing the measure.\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told an interviewer last month she could be open to a subpoena of Trump's taxes as part of a Senate Intelligence Committee probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Politico quoted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as saying he wanted presidential candidates to be required by law to release their tax returns beginning in 2020.\n\n\"The tax return is the lowest ethical bar that you can have for a presidential nominee or a president,\" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, top Senate Finance Democrat who introduced legislation in January requiring nominees and sitting presidents to disclose their returns.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Peter Cooney and James Dalgleish)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxreturns-idUSKBN1685TP"}, {"title": "Trump touts support for NATO, but expansion languishes in Senate", "text": "A NATO flag flies at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels during a NATO ambassadors meeting on the situation in Ukraine and the Crimea region, March 2, 2014.

By late February, it had been approved by 24. Members see Montenegro's accession as a way to counter Russia's efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee has twice voted in favor of Montenegro, first in December and again in January.\n\nBut objections by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee have blocked a vote in the full Senate.\n\nAt a September hearing, Paul questioned the wisdom of angering Russia by allowing a tiny country that could not play a significant role in defending the United States to join the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n\n\"I think we need to think this through, and we need to have a little bit more of a debate,\" he said then.\n\nOn Wednesday, Paul said he still objected.\n\n\"I'm not so sure what they add to our defense. So I'm not so sure it's a great idea that somehow Montenegro's going to defend the United States,\" Paul told Reuters.\n\nA spokesman for Lee said the senator objected only to the Senate considering the matter with a quick voice vote, saying he wanted a roll call so every member's position would be recorded.\n\nLee has not made his opinion on Montenegro's accession public, the spokesman said.\n\nROLL CALL\n\nAsked if a roll call vote would be scheduled, a spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had no updates to provide. If there is a Senate vote, Montenegro's accession is expected to receive the two-thirds majority needed to pass.\n\nMontenegrin Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanovic told Reuters last month that he had been assured that the Senate would ratify his country's accession by May.\n\nTrump has called for closer ties to Moscow and criticized NATO as obsolete. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, he reaffirmed support for the alliance, but said he expects U.S. allies to pay more of the cost of their own security needs.\n\nMontenegrin officials blame Moscow for an extended campaign intended to prevent the country from joining NATO. Last month, they said they had evidence Russia was involved in a plot to overthrow its government during an election last October, an accusation Moscow dismissed.\n\nThe charges echoed assertions by U.S. intelligence that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nTrump could still keep Montenegro from joining by refusing to formally deposit the country's Protocol of Accession. Doing so would signal a significant rift with his own party in Congress.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; editing by John Walcott and Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nato-montenegro-idUSKBN1685QS"}, {"title": "No change to mortgage interest deduction in Trump tax plan: Mnuchin", "text": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 14, 2017.

REUTERS/Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool\n\nWASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump showed a different side in his first address to Congress. This Trump was part deal-maker, part salesman, asking for unity and trying to repackage his populist message in more palatable terms.\n\nHe was less combative, less thin-skinned and more inclusive.\n\nAnd where five weeks ago at his inauguration, he slammed Washington's politicians as out-of-touch elitists who prospered at the expense of the public, his message on Tuesday night was different: I need you, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nAlways a showman, the reality TV star-turned-politician laid out plenty of promises: A massive infrastructure and public works program; tax cuts for the middle class; immigration reform; a healthcare overhaul; an education bill.\n\nAll of it would require congressional action, likely by different coalitions of conservatives, moderates and Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is our vision. This is our mission,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we can only get there together.\u201d\n\nTrump, a Republican who has taunted Democrats over his 2016 election victory and publicly fumed as they held up his Cabinet nominees, did not criticize them this time. Repeatedly, he asked for their help, arguing that the country\u2019s problems call for bipartisan solutions.\n\nAfter weeks of attacks on the media, political rivals and the judges who ruled against his executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump finally eased off, although his proposals were short on specifics.\n\n\u201cIt was a softer tone and he gave a speech and not a tweet and that's more suitable when you're president of the United States,\" said Democratic Representative Peter Welch. \"The challenges are going to be the details on his policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was presidential tonight in a way he has not been before this,\" said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak.\n\nThe address appeared to show some recognition by the White House that Trump\u2019s bombastic go-it-alone style has its limits. After a parade of executive orders, Trump must now turn his attention to the big-ticket items on his agenda requiring legislative action.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done all he can unilaterally,\u201d said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. \u201cNow he needs to pass bills.\u201d\n\nEven though Republicans control Congress, Blakeman said Trump needs Democrats to build a majority that would allow conservative Republicans to oppose some of his more centrist proposals, such as hefty infrastructure spending and talks on immigration reform.\n\n\u201cThe president is as transactional a person as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Blakeman said. \u201cHe understands that you might not like this deal, but I need you for three other deals.\u201d\n\nSKEPTICAL\n\nDespite the softer tone, Trump's divisive policies and months of hostile rhetoric will not be forgotten by his adversaries.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a round of television interviews on Wednesday morning, dismissed Trump's speech as detached from reality, saying the softer tone did not match the administration's hard-line agenda presented so far.\n\n\"His speeches are populist. They're aimed at the working folks who supported him. But his governing and what he does is hard right, favoring special interests over the working class,\" Schumer told CBS.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, told MSNBC that Trump gave a good sales pitch but has offered little in the way of concrete proposals: \"All they have is rhetoric. We don't have any reality in terms of any legislation.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats said they liked Trump\u2019s infrastructure program, his childcare tax credit, his call to reduce the prices of prescription drugs, and his vow to preserve some key elements of former President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health insurance law.\n\nDemocrats remain troubled, among other things, by Trump\u2019s desire to slash domestic programs to increase military spending, his plans to reduce taxes for the wealthy and corporations, as well as his aggressive policy to deport illegal immigrants.\n\nTo be sure, the more foreboding elements of Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric were still present, albeit slightly dialed-down. As he did during the campaign, he portrayed a country in ruinous economic shape and plagued by terrorism, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigrants.\n\nIn coming days, the White House is likely to release a revised version of its travel ban, reigniting a controversy that overshadowed the first weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency. [nL2N1GE0SB]\n\nTrump came into the address struggling with public opinion. In an interview with Fox News he acknowledged that he and his staff had not been effective communicators. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll found about 48 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance, with 46 percent backing him, poor numbers for a new president.\n\nMackowiak said Trump\u2019s address could reverse his fortunes in a \u201ccrucial moment\u201d for his presidency. \u201cHis public support will improve from this speech,\u201d he said.\n\nBut John Geer, a public-opinion expert at Vanderbilt University, was not convinced. \"He's going to have to do more than give a speech.\"\n\n(Reporting and writing by James Oliphant; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan and Susan Heavey; Editing by Howard Goller and Frances Kerry)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tone-analysis-idUSKBN1683EC"}, {"title": "White House supports renewal of spy law without reforms: official", "text": "A surveillance camera is pictured atop the border fence separating the United States and Mexico in El Paso, U.S. January 17, 2017.

Upstream allows the NSA to copy Web traffic flowing along the \"internet backbone\" located inside the United States and search that data.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say the programs are vital to national security.\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers have said reforms to Section 702 are needed, in part to ensure the privacy protections on Americans are not violated. The U.S. House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee met Wednesday to discuss possible changes to the law.\n\nDATA MONITORED\n\nThough FISA is intended to govern spy programs intended for foreigners, an unknown amount of communications belonging to Americans are also collected due to a range of technical and practical reasons.\n\nSuch collection has been defended by U.S. intelligence agencies as \"incidental,\" but privacy groups have said it allows for backdoor seizures of U.S. data without proper judicial oversight and could impact thousands or millions of Americans.\n\nFor years lawmakers have sought an estimate on how many Americans are caught in the crosshairs of the foreign intelligence programs, saying it is necessary to consider changes to Section 702.\n\nOn Tuesday former Senator Dan Coats, Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence, told a Senate panel he would \"do everything I can\" to publicly disclose such a figure before the law's expiration, though he stopped short of guaranteeing it.\n\nSection 702, he added, was the \"crown jewels\" of the intelligence community.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Dustin Volz, writing by Dustin Volz; Editing by Andrew Hay and Alistair Bell)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fisa-idUSKBN16855P"}, {"title": "Kellyanne Conway 'inadvertently' plugged Ivanka products: White House", "text": "An Ivanka Trump-branded blouse is seen for sale at off-price retailer Winners in Toronto, Ontario, Canada February 3, 2017.

REUTERS/Scott Audette\n\nCLEARWATER, Fla. While U.S. President Donald Trump tried to win over skeptics in Congress on Tuesday, he never had to worry about losing the faithful at the Quaker Steak and Lube.\n\nAbout two dozen fans of the 45th president gathered at the bar and restaurant in Clearwater, Florida, still committed to Trump despite the tumult of his first 40 days in office.\n\nThey praised the Republican president's first address to a joint session of Congress, both for its familiar content and his newly deferential tone.\n\n\"He nailed it. He knocked it out of the park,\" said Dean Mears, 58, of Clearwater, who watched with about two dozen others under large-screen TVs that were tuned to Fox News, the president's favored cable news channel.\n\nLike Trump supporters in other parts of the country, they praised the president's more inclusive and less bombastic language as he also promised that \"America must put its own citizens first,\" crack down on illegal immigration and build up the military.\n\nThe milder Trump contrasted markedly with the candidate who insulted his rivals during the 2016 campaign, recently branded the news media the \"enemy of the people\" and was caught making vulgar remarks about grabbing women on a decade-old video.\n\nIn Boone County, Kentucky, the vice chairwoman of the local Republican Party, Phyllis Sparks, said she liked that Trump \"spoke not only to his base but to all Americans.\"\n\nKirt Jacobs, a Louisville entrepreneur, said Trump \"was all about we and very little, if any, about me.\"\n\nIn the Denver suburbs, a voter who supported Marco Rubio in last year's Republican nominating contest, said Trump validated her vote for him in November.\n\n\"He had a much softer tone - more presidential - but stayed true to his principles,\" said Kathleen Johnson. \"He wasn't blaming people and sounded more comforting.\"\n\nA CNN/ORC national poll found that 78 percent of respondents who watched the speech had a positive reaction.\n\nWith 3 million tweets, Trump's speech was the most tweeted- about presidential address to Congress, surpassing the previous record of 2.6 million for Obama's 2015 State of the Union speech, a Twitter spokesman said.\n\n'STICKING TO WHAT HE SAID'\n\nAt the Quaker Steak and Lube, the praise began beforehand, with a rally on the sidewalk outside where supporters waved signs reading: \"America First\" and \"Florida for Trump.\"\n\nThey were mostly greeted by honking horns of approval, but also a few passing drivers who shouted expletives.\n\nTrump won 46 percent of the national popular vote in last year's election, 2 percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton, but prevailed in the Electoral College state-by-state tally needed to win the White House.\n\nNationally, his approval rating has sagged to a low level for a new president, around 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls by Real Clear Politics. Trump has been shaken by investigations into his campaign's possible ties to Russia, his misstatements about his levels of support, and a federal court's halt to his executive order temporarily banning entry into the country for people from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nClearwater, on the Gulf Coast, sits in Pinellas County in the heart of Florida, where the past four statewide elections have been decided by about 1 percentage point.\n\nTrump, a part-time Floridian, flipped the results from the last two presidential elections in Pinellas County in his favor after former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, carried the county in 2008 and 2012.\n\nThe county has long been a retirement destination, especially among those leaving the Midwest.

Again I don\u2019t think that is a surprise.\n\n\"With no surprises and few financial specifics, it is likely that equity investors will focus on how many of his themes can be passed by Congress given how late it is getting in the legislative calendar. Skepticism over the likelihood of policy enactment may create a brief pullback in stocks at some point.\n\n\"There was nothing in the speech, or in the President\u2019s agenda, that is likely to alter the behavior of corporate bond investors, who have been driving this equity bull market for eight years via debt-fueled buybacks. They bought a strong $18 billion of new corporate bonds on Tuesday in advance of the speech, and they will likely be back at work on Wednesday, putting their cash flows to work. I believe that these flows are likely to keep any stock market pullback brief and shallow.\"\n\nBUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, BB&T WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA:\n\n\u201cThe speech was a summary of Trump\u2019s policies. Stocks could move higher tomorrow as nothing has changed and stock investors are still expecting infrastructure build out, tax and regulatory relief, and changes in Affordable Care, but the timetable has not been clarified for these. Republican constituents may pressure Congress to step up the pace in moving the Trump agenda forward.\n\n\"Some specifics: pressure on drug margins, completion across state lines for healthcare organizations, military expenditures increasing \u2013 but nothing new here.\n\n\"Fed policy will get more attention this week and next. Manufacturing PMI tomorrow and employment report next Friday (March 10) will be watched. Yellen will be speaking this Friday. Fed funds futures showing a higher probability of an increase at the FOMC March 15 meeting.\u201d\n\nJ.J. FELDMAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT MIRACLE MILE ADVISORS IN LA:\n\n\u201cThere was nothing really new,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good speech in that it was more uniting than divisive but from the market perspective it was status quo,\u201d\n\n\u201cThis probably wasn\u2019t the venue but if new details on tax reform are not coming soon there\u2019s going to be disappointment for sure.\u201c\n\nJUAN PEREZ, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON:\n\n\"Trump said a lot of things that are positive for financial markets such as spending a huge amount for infrastructure. Overall there were no real surprises as these are pronouncements that we have heard before. However, I expect that market gains from his speech would be subdued by the continued tone of protectionism in his statements. Anytime, you attack trade deals as Trump did, the market gets nervous.\"\n\nPAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE IN ST. LOUIS, MO.\n\n\u201cI was impressed though, or at least relieved, that it wasn\u2019t like his inauguration speech, it wasn\u2019t a challenge or a gauntlet thrown down to the opposition or to other countries. It was a speech that was more balanced and more presidential-sounding.\n\n\"But even as a state of the union address, which it sounded a lot like, it wasn\u2019t very specific. It especially and could have and didn\u2019t prioritize all of these different things he was talking about. Some of the policies are going to be very expensive - a trillion dollars for infrastructure, $100 billion a year, extra defense spending - the budget may not have room for all of that.\n\n\"He didn\u2019t talk at all about how they were going to fund any of that. He also didn\u2019t talk about tax reform, which I expected he would give Congress some marching orders in terms of what he wants - he hardly said anything about tax reform.\n\n\"He talked about the Affordable Care Act but again he didn\u2019t talk about any of the directives of are we going to repeal and replace now or repeal and replace later. He did say he wanted continuity but moderate Republicans are not convinced the conservative Republicans have that as a priority. So it may be even difficult to pass the ACA repeal in this budget bill.\n\n\"He was effective at reaching out to the other side, he was effective at times in being able to connect items. For example, connecting education as the way to break the cycle of poverty and then morphing or transitioning into violent crime and cutting down on that. Those were effective points and effective transitions. But again not enough detail for investors and certainly the markets were chopping around while he was speaking. It wasn\u2019t a big market mover and we still have to wait for the details. I don\u2019t think we are going to see much change.\n\n\"There is no reason to sell, he didn\u2019t throw water on any of the agenda, he simply didn\u2019t clarify it any.\u201d\n\nDAVID TAWIL, PRESIDENT OF MAGLAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK\n\n\"I think the market is going to be positive. The market continues to see him as a good-for-business president. He\u2019s very pragmatic when it comes to business. In terms of getting these grand visions done, I don\u2019t think the market gives so much importance to that. When he spoke about cost cutting, that immediately resonates with everyone on Wall Street. That\u2019s easy stuff. That\u2019s low hanging fruit. It\u2019s really hard to grow revenues. But it\u2019s really easy to cut costs. There is so much fat. It\u2019s so over regulated. This is easy stuff. He said enough of that during the speech that he will resonate well.\n\n\"I think some people were probably looking for some meat on the bones. He definitely covered everything. It was more of a laundry list. There wasn\u2019t a lot of details.\n\n\"To me, the tax reform is something everybody wants. Repatriation of money abroad is something that ever wants. Why not take care of those and then take care of the dicey things? Like Obamacare and immigration.\"\n\nOMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON DC\n\n\"(Trump's) mention of historic treaties and NATO specifically was reassuring for our allies globally, and in that sense it was probably reassuring for global financial markets as well.\"\n\n\"(The speech) was still probably light on actual details on the fiscal side of things. We got mention of a trillion dollar infrastructure spending package. I think it's very early so I wouldn't necessarily hang my hat on that number. It was largely absent of any major focus on the tax side of things. In terms of overall details, on the fiscal side of the equation, it was probably pretty light. But I think despite that on some level the market might be reassured by the more or less balanced tone of the speech. It was much more presidential than some of the previous speeches and commentary we've gotten from the president.\"\n\nPAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO\n\n\u201cThe devil is going to be in the details and I think that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see the futures move too terribly much. The markets are still, show me what you are going to do, how is this all going to work and how are we paying for it. That\u2019s going to take probably a couple weeks to a couple months to get laid out.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody is looking for more details and we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think expectations right now are really high all the way around and it\u2019s going to be a process. We\u2019re going to have to wait to see some of this develop.\u201d\n\nSTEVE MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO\n\n\"I thought it went pretty well, certainly no land mines or explosions.\"\n\n\"From an investor's perspective there was no new information, no surprises good or bad. From the perspective of where money goes tomorrow, I don't see what we have learned that's new or different. ... But he burnished his image, so there's a positive there. He's a pro business president so that's a good thing.\"\n\nRANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS\n\n\u201cHe pretty much didn\u2019t say anything he hadn\u2019t said before so markets have no reason to react overly positively or overly negatively ... Would the market have liked details sure, but I don\u2019t think it was expecting them.\"\n\n\u201cIf anything the market might move moderately higher tomorrow. It pulled back moderately today. The uptick in volatility today was a preparation for the potential for a downside move ... It was a little bit of hedging going on before an event that could move the market.\u201d\n\nA key focus for Wednesday will be Personal Consumption Expenditures, a key inflationary measure that the U.S. Federal Reserve watches, Frederick said.\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT IN MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:\n\n\u201cHe was surprisingly detailed about what to replace Obamacare with. It\u2019s likely Congress will be able to take that up shortly as part of the 2017 budget and then quickly pivot to the 2018 budget which will deal with tax reform. That plan is much less developed, but he has time.\u201d\n\nOn taxes, Jacobsen said: \u201cEvery deduction and credit that would need to be eliminated to lower tax rates in a budget-neutral way has strong defenders. That\u2019s how those deductions and credits got there. So, we\u2019ll just have to watch and wait to see which special interests President Trump will take on.\u201d\n\nTIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS GROUP IN BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK.\n\n\"It seemed to be a somewhat kinder and gentler Trump. He wasn't attacking individuals like he often does.\"\n\n\"This remains a very pro-growth agenda and the markets like that, but I didn't hear anything new that would make it necessarily move ahead, except that he stuck to his guns to make his agenda items happen.\"\n\nMARKET REACTION:\n\nSTOCKS: U.S. stock futures were stronger at the start of Trump's address, with major indices 0.3 percent higher.

He said the vast majority of people convicted for terrorism-related offenses since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, had come from outside the United States and vowed the country should not \"become a sanctuary for extremists\".\n\nHe said the United States should switch away from lower-skilled immigration and adopt a merit-based system, adding that Republicans and Democrats could work together to achieve immigration reform as long as it focused on improving jobs and wages and strengthening the country's security.\n\nConstruction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will begin soon, Trump said. Throughout his election campaign and in the first weeks of his presidency, Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, but he made no mention of that on Tuesday.\n\nHEALTHCARE REFORM\n\nTrump called on Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. He said reforms should lower the cost of healthcare and ensure people with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage.\n\nHe proposed tax credits and expanded health savings accounts for people to purchase health insurance. Legal reforms should also protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, he said.\n\nTAX\n\nTrump vowed \"historic\" reform to reduce the corporate tax rate to make U.S. companies more globally competitive and promised \"massive\" tax relief for the middle class. He gave no new details on the tax reforms he would like to see and made no mention of a border adjustment tax that lies at the heart of a Republican proposal in the House of Representatives.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nTrump said Congress will be asked to approve legislation for a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure, financed through both public and private channels. \"Buy American\" and \"Hire American\" will be the guiding principles, he said.\n\nDEFENSE SPENDING AND FOREIGN POLICY\n\nTrump promised to send to Congress a budget to rebuild the military, billing it as one of the largest-ever increases in defense spending. He vowed to work with U.S. allies, including in the Muslim world, to destroy Islamic State, describing the radical militant group as a \"network of lawless savages.\"\n\nHe vowed support for NATO but said U.S. partners must meet their financial obligations. He also reaffirmed \"our unbreakable alliance\" with Israel.\n\n(Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-factbox-idUSKBN168357"}, {"title": "Trump poised to lift federal coal ban, other green rules: White House", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks up while hosting a House and Senate leadership lunch at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 1, 2017.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nIn formulating a new executive order limiting travel to the United States, President Donald Trump has promised to make the directive harder to fight successfully in court than the one he issued in January.\n\nOne way the administration will likely try to do that, legal experts say, is to shape the order more narrowly to undercut the opportunity for states and other opponents to sue by showing courts they have \"standing,\" or the ability to argue the president's order causes them harm.\n\nBut legal experts said a new order, which a White House source said was expected this week, was unlikely to fully eliminate the ability of challengers to pursue legal actions.\n\nMore than two dozen lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts against the initial travel ban, which temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In one case, which ultimately got the order temporarily suspended, the state of Washington claimed standing in part because the ban affected Washington residents living and working legally in the United States as permanent residents known as green card holders.\n\nBy excluding legal permanent residents from a new order, something the administration has said is likely, the president would make it harder for opponents to challenge the ban.\n\nLarry Klayman, founder of the conservative advocacy group Freedom Watch, said that with a narrower order, legal standing could be a real problem for potential challengers.\n\n\"If you're not a citizen, or if you're not a permanent resident, you have no constitutional rights,\" Klayman said.\n\nTrump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. Americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but was condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies.\n\nThe initial order caused chaos at airports, as people, including green card holders initially, were temporarily blocked from entering the United States.\n\nSome of those people, and several states, challenged the order. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in the Washington case, said the ban likely violated the state's due process rights and suspended it.\n\nThe 9th Circuit also ruled that Washington had legal standing to challenge the ban, over objections from the Department of Justice.\n\nStephen Legomsky, former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Barack Obama, said a narrower ban \"weakens the arguments for standing but doesn't entirely eliminate them.\"\n\nLegomsky noted that, \"in general the Constitution does not apply to people outside the United States, but that is not iron clad.\"\n\nA U.S. citizen whose spouse was barred from visiting by the order, for instance, could argue that he or she had standing to challenge it. Or a state university might argue that the order negatively affected it.\n\nIn its ruling, the 9th Circuit said Washington state had standing because it was harmed by Trump's order, specifically noting that faculty at the state's universities from those seven countries would be prohibited from traveling for research or academic collaboration.\n\n\"The universities' reputations depend on the success of their professors' research,\" the court wrote.\n\nThe one thing legal experts on all sides of the issue agree on is that the new order will be challenged in courts.\n\n\"No matter what they do there will be litigation,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr. He said he thinks it likely challengers will be able to establish standing, leaving the courts to decide whether the ban is legal. At that point, Yale-Loehr says, the wording of the new order will become crucial.\n\n\"If they limit the executive order to people who have never been to the U.S. before, they might win on the merits eventually,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Mica Rosenberg in New York; additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington editing by Sue Horton and Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-legal-idUSKBN1682SE"}, {"title": "New Trump immigration order will remove Iraq from list of banned countries: AP", "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump reacts after delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress from the floor of the House of Representatives iin Washington, U.S., February 28, 2017.

The order would require companies further down the supply chain, such as retailers who sell gasoline, to shoulder that load.\n\nRefiners have long requested this change, saying the biofuels program has hammered their profits.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kelly Love, however, said on Tuesday afternoon \"there is no ethanol executive order in the works.\"\n\nEthanol and fuel retail groups reacted quickly to the reports. Trump\u2019s regulation adviser, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is majority owner of CVR Energy (CVI.N), a refining company that would benefit from the change. That stock is up 80 percent since Trump's election in November.\n\nEven after the White House denial, RFA Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen stuck by his statement, saying there is \"certainly something in the works, but they're not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it.\" He declined to identify who in the Trump administration contacted the association.\n\n\"Despite our continued opposition to the move, we were told the executive order was not negotiable,\" Dinneen said.\n\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard requires fuel companies to use increasing amounts of biofuel blended with gasoline and diesel. Former U.S. President Barack Obama expanded the rules, which started under his predecessor, George W. Bush, when gasoline prices were near records.\n\nRefineries without operations designed to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline have to pay for renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, to meet U.S. environmental standards to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The cost for refiners has increased sharply in the last few years; nine major publicly traded refiners paid $2.5 billion in 2016 for RINs costs, a 78 percent increase from 2015.\n\nAmong those that have pushed for the change is Icahn, who holds an 82 percent stake of CVR. That company's shares jumped on Tuesday before paring gains after the White House denial; they ended up 3.5 percent on the day to $22.92 a share, on heavier-than-usual trading volume of 1.7 million shares.\n\nIcahn was unavailable for comment, and CVR declined to comment.\n\nEmily Skor, CEO of biofuel trade group Growth Energy, expressed concern about any role Icahn may have played in planning changes to the program.\n\n\"I assure you this is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn,\" she said. \"If we had been approached with this deal, we would have flat-out rejected it.\"\n\nSeven Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the White House this month, saying Icahn\u2019s role as an adviser to Trump created financial conflicts of interest and called for a review.\n\nShares of U.S. refiner Valero (VLO.N), which would also benefit from the changes, ended up 1 percent on Tuesday to close at $67.95 a share.\n\n'BACKROOM DEAL'\n\nBiofuel organizations and groups representing fuel retailers and integrated oil companies like the U.S. units of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L) have opposed the change, which they say will complicate managing the program.\n\nOne source said the RFA was told the executive order would include incentives for ethanol and biodiesel in a tradeoff for the blending shift.\n\nThose changes could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, a review of how the Environmental Protection Agency estimates emission impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel, the source said.\n\nChicago Board of Trade corn futures Cc1 ended up about 1.7 percent. CBOT soyoil BOc1, which is used for biodiesel, rose 4.8 percent.\n\nCompliance credits used to meet the annual biofuel blending standards traded around 43 cents on Tuesday from 47 cents to 48 cents previously, paring big morning losses.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Michael Hirtzer, Emily Flitter and Jessica Renick-Ault; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Chizu Nomiyama)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-renewables-idUSKBN1671PD"}, {"title": "NSA risks talent exodus amid morale slump, Trump fears", "text": "WASHINGTON The National Security Agency risks a brain-drain of hackers and cyber spies due to a tumultuous reorganization and worries about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and President Donald Trump, according to current and former NSA officials and cybersecurity industry sources.\n\nHalf-a-dozen cybersecurity executives told Reuters they had witnessed a marked increase in the number of U.S. intelligence officers and government contractors seeking employment in the private sector since Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nOne of the executives, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said he was stunned by the caliber of the would-be recruits. They are coming from a variety of government intelligence and law enforcement agencies, multiple executives said, and their interest stems in part from concerns about the direction of U.S intelligence agencies under Trump.\n\nRetaining and recruiting talented technical personnel has become a top national security priority in recent years as Russia, China, Iran and other nation states and criminal groups have sharpened their cyber offensive abilities. NSA and other intelligence agencies have long struggled to deter some of their best employees from leaving for higher-paying jobs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\n\nThe problem is especially acute at NSA, current and former officials said, due to a reorganization known as NSA21 that began last year and aims to merge the agency's electronic eavesdropping and domestic cyber-security operations.\n\nThe two-year overhaul includes expanding parts of NSA that deal with business management and human resources and putting them on par with research and engineering. The aim is to \"ensure that we're using all of our resources to maximum effect to accomplish our mission,\u201d NSA Director Mike Rogers said.\n\nThe changes include new management structures that have left some career employees uncertain about their missions and prospects. Former employees say the reorganization has failed to address widespread concerns that the agency is falling behind in exploiting private-sector technological breakthroughs.\n\nA former top NSA official said he had been told by three current officials that budget problems meant there was too little money for promotions. That is especially important for younger employees, who sometimes need two jobs to make ends meet in the expensive Washington D.C. area, the official said.\n\n\"Morale is as low as I\u2019ve ever seen it,\" said another former senior NSA official, who maintains close contact with current employees.\n\nAsked about the risk of losing talent from NSA and other agencies, White House spokesman Michael Anton said Trump had sought to reassure the intelligence community by visiting the CIA headquarters on his first full day in office.\n\nAnton also pointed to the military spending increase in Trump's budget proposal released on Monday.\n\nIt will likely take more than a visit to the CIA to patch up relations with the intelligence community, the current and former officials said.\n\nTrump has attacked findings from intelligence agencies that Russia hacked emails belonging to Democratic Party operatives during the 2016 presidential campaign to help him win, though he did eventually accept the findings.\n\nIn January, Trump accused intelligence agencies of leaking false information and said it was reminiscent of tactics used in Nazi Germany.\n\nHOW MANY?\n\nThe breadth of any exodus from the NSA and other intelligence agencies is difficult to quantify.\n\nThe NSA has \"seen a steady rise\" in the attrition rate among its roughly 36,000 employees since 2009, and it now sits at a \"little less than six percent,\" according to an NSA spokesman. NSA director Michael Rogers said last year that the attrition rate was 3.3 percent in 2015, suggesting a sharp jump in departures since then.\n\nSeveral senior NSA officials who have left or plan to leave, including deputy director Richard Ledgett and the head of cyber defense, Curtis Dukes, have said their departures were unrelated to Trump or the reorganization.\n\nSome turnover is normal with any new administration, government and industry officials noted, and a stronger economy has also improved pay and prospects in the private sector.\n\n\"During this time the economy has been recovering from the recession, unemployment rates have been falling and the demand for highly skilled technical talent has been increasing,\" an NSA spokesman said, when asked to comment on the reports of employee departures.\n\nIn a statement, Kathy Hutson, NSA's chief of human resources, said the agency continues \"to attract amazing talent necessary to conduct the security mission the nation needs.\"\n\nCONTROVERSIAL BOSS\n\nSome NSA veterans attribute the morale issues and staff departures to the leadership style of Rogers, who took over the spy agency in 2014 with the task of dousing an international furor caused by leaks from former contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nConcern about Rogers reached an apex last October, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recommended to then-President Barack Obama that Rogers be removed.\n\nThe NSA did not respond to a request for comment on the recommendation last fall that Rogers be replaced.\n\nRogers is now expected to retain his job at NSA for at least another year, according to former officials.\n\nRogers acknowledged concerns about potential morale problems last month, telling a congressional committee that Trump's broadsides against the intelligence community could create \"a situation where our workforce decides to walk.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of the intelligence community has exacerbated the stress caused by the reorganization at the NSA, said Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer now with Brookings Institution.\n\nThe \"tone coming from the White House makes an already difficult situation worse, by eroding the sense of common purpose and service,\" she said.\n\nA wave of departures of career personnel, Hennessey added, \"would represent an incalculable loss to national security.\"\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz and Warren Strobel; Additional reporting by John Walcott and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Ross Colvin)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-nsa-idUSKBN1672ML"}, {"title": "White House biofuels order would include incentives for ethanol: source", "text": "The White House has assured the Renewable Fuels Association that any executive orders changing the U.S. Renewable Fuels Program would include measures to support use of ethanol and biodiesel, according to a source familiar with the discussions between the White House and the trade group.\n\nThe source, who requested anonymity, said the group was told the executive order could include a long-awaited waiver that would allow E15 gasoline to be sold more easily during summertime months, a review of how the Environmental Protection Agency estimates emissions impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel.\n\nA White House official did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-renewables-ethanol-idUSKBN16722Q"}, {"title": "White House says no ethanol executive order in the works", "text": "The White House on Tuesday said there was no executive order on ethanol in the works.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the head of the Renewable Fuels Administration, Bob Dinneen, said he had been told by a member of President Donald Trump's administration that Trump intended to sign an executive order shifting the point of obligation for blending biofuels away from refiners.\n\n\"There is no ethanol executive order in the works,\" White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said.\n\nDinneen responded to the White House denial, saying: \"There is certainly something in the works, but they\u2019re not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Richard Valdmanis; editing by Grant McCool)", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-renewables-whitehouse-idUSKBN1672BV"}, {"title": "U.S., China discuss 'mutually beneficial' economic relationship", "text": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson greets Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi at the State Department in Washington, U.S., February 28, 2017.
