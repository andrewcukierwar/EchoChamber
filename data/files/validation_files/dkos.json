The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities pointed out when it was first raised that \"a one-time $15 billion investment with little direction on how to spend the funds wouldnt come close to offsetting the enormous damage that the underlying House bill would do to millions of people who would lose these important categories of care.\" Concentrating it in the first three years wouldn't help a bit on the next six years.

Its worth remembering now what McConnell said back in 2013, when after years of trying to negotiate with Republicans who had been blocking dozens and dozens of Obama nominees, Harry Reid changed the rules. Reid would \"be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever\" for making that change, charged McConnell. Well, here we go.\n\nHeres how it happens. The Senate comes in at 10:00 and McConnell bitches and moans about how he's being forced to do this, what a fine man Gorsuch is and Democrats are ruining the Senate.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas)  the Senates No. 2 Republican  said the talks were aimed at finding ways to speed up the consideration of Trumps non-Cabinet positions. Basically, theres been some discussion on whether or not we ought to reinstitute the standing order that limited post-cloture time, he said. Basically, the idea is to expedite sub-Cabinet nominees.\n\nWhich is ridiculously unnecessary. Because as of the beginning of this week, Trump had nominated just 74 civilians to various posts24 of whom have withdrawnout of 549 positions that require Senate confirmation. By this time in 2009, President Obama had nominated 130, and, in 2001 President Bush had nominated a whopping 275. So what's the problem here? Its not Democratic foot-dragging.

John Hickenlooper. Brauchler is best known for prosecuting the 2012 Aurora theater shooter, though he was unable to secure the death penalty. National Republicans tried to convince Brauchler to challenge Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in 2016 and he almost did, but Brauchler abruptly announced that he would seek re-election instead. The National Journal wrote at the time that a \"serious family health issue\" unexpectedly kept him out of that race.\n\nBrauchler immediately made it clear that the death penalty will be one of his major issues. Brauchler has criticized Hickenlooper for granting convicted murder Nathan Dunlap a temporary reprieve from the death penalty, and has pledged that if he becomes governor, he will put Dunlap back on death row on \"day one.\"\n\nThat's a potentially risky tactic in a general election, though. In 2014, the GOP tried to use Dunlap against Hickenlooper in an expensive ad campaign that featured the father of one of Dunlap's victims calling Hickenlooper a liar and a coward. The commercial generated plenty of controversy, especially after other members of the victim's family objected to it. Hickenlooper's camp also took issue with the GOP for arguing that the governor wanted to give Dunlap \"full clemency.\" It's unknown what impact the commercial had, but Hickenlooper ended up winning re-election 49-46.\n\nBrauchler won't have the primary to himself by any means, and we recently ran down the large developing field. Brauchler himself offered some commentary about his intra-party rivals, telling The Denver Post that \"[e]very single one of them is a potential self-funder or has long family connections to politics. I'm not that guy.\" In particular, this seems like a dig at state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, a second cousin of George W. Bush; Stapleton isn't running yet and is publicly playing coy, but the local media is treating him like a likely candidate.\n\nWe also have one other Republican who is reportedly considering. Multiple news outlets say that Jack Graham, the wealthy former athletic director of Colorado State University, is considering, though Graham doesn't seem to have said anything publicly. Graham ran for the Senate in 2016 but lost the primary 38-25 to Darryl Glenn, a favorite of the far-right.\n\n IA-Gov: Yet another Iowa Democrat is talking about running next year against Republican Kim Reynolds, who will likely be governor soon after incumbent Terry Branstad is confirmed as ambassador to China. John Norris, a longtime Iowa political hand who served as chief of staff to Tom Vilsack both during Vilsack's governorship and during his stint as U.S. secretary of agriculture, tells Iowa Starting Line that he's considering.\n\nIn addition to his connections to Vilsack's network, Starting Line's Pat Rynard says that Norris is close to ex-Sen. Tom Harkin's donor base and to national fundraisers. Norris himself ran for the House in 2002 and lost 55-43 to Republican incumbent Tom Latham. Several other Democrats are looking at the gubernatorial race.\n\n IL-Gov: Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's first two years in office have been defined by his many fights with the Democratic-led legislature, but apparently, that's still not good enough for some Republicans. After a conservative state representative went on the radio and attacked Rauner for not meeting with Trump on Medicare and accused him of mulling a tax increase, Politico Illinois started looking into whether there actually was any energy for a primary challenge to Rauner. Apparently, the answer is actually yes. State Sen. Sam McCann tells Politico that he's been approached by unnamed people about a bid. McCann ruled nothing out, saying that he does \"not intend to think about the concept of running for governor, let alone comment on it, until after May 31st, if at all.\"\n\nWhile it sounds like if McCann ran, he would challenge Rauner from the right, the state senator has a good relationship with labor. Last cycle, Rauner supported a primary challenger against McCann, and the governor's allied PAC dropped $3 million against the incumbent. However, labor groups helped McCann, who won renomination 53-47.\n\nIf McCann or anyone else decided to challenge Rauner for renomination, it's tough to see them actually winning. While a credible primary campaign could force Rauner to spend some money, the uber wealthy governor could easily restock his warchest without a second thought. However, as Politico notes, the real danger for Rauner would be if a challenger forced the governor to tack to the right. Illinois is a very blue state, and Rauner doesn't have much room for error if he wants to win a second term next year.\n\nNo matter what, though, Democrats will have a primary of their own, and it may be about to get bigger. Wealthy venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker recently formed an exploratory committee, and Politico reports he will announce he's in on Thursday. Pritzker is actually considerably wealthier than even Rauner, and if he makes it to the general, he could negate Rauner's potential financial advantage. However, a number of other Democrats are also running, and if Pritzker is really in, he can't take the primary for granted.\n\n MN-Gov: This week, Rep. Tim Walz unveiled endorsements from two Democratic politicians from very different parts of Minnesota. Walz has the support of Rep. Collin Peterson, who represents a conservative rural seat in the northwest corner of the seat, and ex-Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak. Most of Walz's intra-party rivals come from the Twin Cities, and Rybak's backing could help him make inroads in this voter-rich area.\n\n NM-Gov: The New Mexico Professional Firefighters Association has thrown their support behind Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham in the slowly-developing Democratic primary. As we like to note, firefighters are usually good allies in political campaigns: They tend to stand out in crowds, and they're a group that almost everyone respects.\n\n RI-Gov: Several Republicans have made noises about challenging Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, and we may have our first taker soon. Joseph Trillo, who left the state House this year and ran Donald Trump's Rhode Island campaign, says he's \"in the process\" of forming an exploratory committee, and is \"a month or two\" away from revealing more about the specifics. When The Providence Journal asked why Trillo, who is 74, is considering, he replied, \"Because I get bored playing golf. I get bored on a trip. I get bored sitting on the beach and...I think I can make a difference in this state, and leave it a better place than I found it. It needs to be whipped into shape.\" If \"vote for me, I'm bored\" isn't a compelling slogan, what is?\n\nMeanwhile, the Providence says that there's speculation that ex-Gov. Lincoln Chafee could be looking to retake his old job after he gave a speech criticizing Raimondo's performance. After witnessing Chafee's 2016 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, we frankly don't want to waste any more time talking about Chafee than we possibly have to. We'll just note that in February, when Chafee was asked by reporter Tara Granahan if he was interested in another bid for Senate, governor, or president, Chafee replied, \"there's a presidential race in 2020!\" and added, \"I'm in between right now it's early, Tara!\" Apparently, Joseph Trillo isn't the only former Rhode Island politician who has nothing else to do.\n\n TN-Gov: Donald Trump has reportedly chosen state Sen. Mark Green to be secretary of the Army, though the decision has not yet been announced. If Green is really Trump's pick (though we can still hold out hope that he's not), it means he's out of the GOP race for governor, but there are plenty of other people out there who may fill the void. Indeed, rich guy Bill Lee, a major GOP donor who is an appointed member of the state Higher Education Commission, recently reiterated his interest, and says he'll decide \"sooner rather than later.\" The Tennessean says that Lee will make up his mind in the next few weeks, but there's no quote from Lee in the article to that effect.\n\nHowever, we can definitively cross off one other possible GOP candidate. Fellow rich guy Bill Hagerty was recently nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to Japan. It's unclear how interested in a gubernatorial run Hagerty was, but unless his nomination falls through or he gets really bored in Tokyo fast, we can take him out of the running.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-34: The all-party primary for this safely blue downtown Los Angeles seat was held on Tuesday, and as we expected, Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez advanced to the June 6 general election. But in a bit of a surprise, ex-Los Angeles Planning Commissioner Robert Lee Ahn, a fellow Democrat, will be Gomez's opponent. Gomez led Ahn 28-19, with nonprofit founder Maria Cabildo a distant third at 10 percent. There are still ballots left to count, but it's extremely unlikely that Cabildo will be able to come close to bumping Ahn out of the general.\n\nGomez is backed by several labor groups and plenty of influential state Democrats, including Sen. Kamala Harris, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and ex-Rep. Xavier Becerra, who resigned from this seat to become state attorney general. However, Ahn looked like a Some Dude to us for most of the contest. But Ahn came on to our radar days before the primary when we learned that he had decisively outraised each of his many opponents, and that he had also self-funded his campaign even more money.\n\nIf Ahn wins in June, he would become the nation's first Korean-American House member in two decades, and that fact seems to have resonated with the area's local Korean-American voters. While Koreans made up just 6 percent of registered voters in this heavily Hispanic seat, they cast about one quarter of the mail-in ballots for this special according to an analysis by Political Data.\n\nAhn also employed some pretty shady tactics during the primary. Los Angeles Times' staffers reported that Ahn sent out campaign literature in envelops marked \"Jury Duty!\" or falsely promising \"New Polling Place Information.\" If that's not against the law, it sure should be.\n\nP.S.: Arturo Carmona, whose former colleagues from the Bernie Sanders campaign accused him of sexism and mismanagement in his capacity as Sanders' deputy political director last year, took 5 percent of the vote.\n\n CA-45: For the second time this week, a Harvard-educated UC Irvine professor who used to work for a Democratic U.S. senator has kicked off a bid against sophomore GOP Rep. Mimi Walters. Dave Min, who was an aide to now-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer from 2007 to 2009, is seeking this historically red but anti-Trump Orange County seat. Min is the son of Korean-born parents, and he notes that 20 percent of eligible voters here are of Asian or Pacific Island descent, and that Korean-American donors have backed other members of the community. Min does seem to understand how tough his campaign will be, predicting that a successful Democratic candidate will need at least $5 million; Min also says that, \"If I see I don't have a chance, I will drop out.\"\n\nA few days ago, fellow UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter jumped in the race. Porter used to work for California's newly-elected Sen. Kamala Harris when Harris was state attorney general and she was a student of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at Harvard Law, and both senators endorsed Porter out of the gate. This district, which includes Irvine and Mission Viejo, has been red for a long time, and Romney easily carried it 55-43. However, Orange County reacted badly to Trump, and Hillary Clinton won 50-44 here last year. Walters easily won her second term against an unheralded Democratic foe last year and Republicans still do very well here downballot. However, if this area remains pissed at Trump next November and Walters' eventual Democratic foe has the resources to tie her to The Donald, things could get interesting.\n\n GA-06: That sound you hear is shards of glass hitting the floor, as Republicans have smashed open their \"in case of emergency\" box and pressed the button marked \"Osama bin Laden.\" The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC close to Paul Ryan, has released a new web ad that tries to link Democrat Jon Ossoff to Osama bin Laden by featuring a photo of the extremely deceased 9/11 mastermind while insinuating that Ossoff has aided and abetted terrorism thanks to the work his filmmaking company has done for Al Jazeera. We don't usually take note of online-only ads, but we make exceptions for utter flaming horseshit.\n\nSuffice it to say this is not the kind of advertisement you run when you're feeling good about your chances. And the CLF's wildly careening messaging also indicates a lack of a coherent strategy for dealing with this race: First they painted Ossoff as an unprepared Star Wars cosplayer, then they decided he was a black bloc anarchist, and now they're making him out to be the number three at Al Qaeda. (They also have a more traditional new ad that brands him as a Pelosi stooge.) These kinds of fear tactics worked all too well in Bush era (remember another Georgia Democrat, Max Cleland), but will they succeed now? In a well-educated district like this one, such base appeals might do more than failthey could backfire.\n\nWhile national GOP groups try desperately to make sure Ossoff doesn't win a majority in the April 18 primary (thus averting a runoff), the actual Republican candidates still have to battle it out on the airwaves for what they hope will be a runner-up spot worth winning. One outside group, Ending Spending, is coming to the aid of former Secretary of State Karen Handel, the nominal GOP frontrunner, with a new ad that praises her as a \"proven conservative\" who's balanced budgetsnot exactly red meat. Politico's Elena Schneider says the group, which was created by the wealthy Ricketts family of Nebraska (Pete Ricketts is now governor), is spending \"six figures\" on the buy.\n\nStill, it's an open question as to which Republican will take that second slot. Handel's occupied it in every publicly released poll to date, though sometimes only by the narrowest of margins. And now businessman Dan Moody, a wealthy former state senator, is arguing that the gap has closed completely: He's put out a new one-day survey from Meeting Street Research showing him tied with Handel at 12 (Ossoff is far, far ahead at 43). Moody, however, has clocked in in fourth place in all four polls we've seen prior to this one, so either he's seeing a late surge, or he's try to placate donors and keep his staff's morale up. But if the GOP's nightmare scenario comes to pass, it won't matter who gets the silver medal.\n\n NH-01: This week, ex-state Liquor Commission Enforcement and Licensing Director Eddie Edwards became the first Republican to announce that he would challenge Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter in this very swingy seat. Edwards, who also used to be police chief of the small town of South Hampton, ran for the 4th state Senate district in 2014 and lost to Democratic incumbent David Watters 56-44, not a bad performance considering that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was carrying the seat 58-42. Three other Republicans have also talked about running here.\n\n NM-01: Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced back in December that she was leaving behind this Albuquerque seat to run for governor, and while several Democrats expressed interest in running to succeed her, no one has announced a bid yet. However, Albuquerque City Councilor Pat Davis, the head of the progressive group Progress Now New Mexico, is the first potential candidate to set up a campaign with the FEC. As we've noted before, not all candidates who file paperwork with the FEC end up running, though Davis has done further than anyone else so far. The GOP only lost this seat in 2008 after decades of control and they came close to retaking it in the 2010 GOP wave, but at 52-36 Clinton, it's very likely to stay blue next year.\n\n PA-06: Republicans drew this suburban Philadelphia seat to be as tough for Team Blue as they could make it, and Republican Rep. Ryan Costello decisively defeated underfunded opponent Mike Parrish 57-43 last year. However, this district swung a bit to the left in the presidential race, lurching from 51-48 Romney to a narrow 48.2-47.6 Clinton win, and it very well could be gettable in a good year.\n\nPolitico reports that one Democrat, Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan, formed an exploratory committee last month, and it sounds like she has an interesting profile. Houlahan was a top executive at the footwear company AND1, and she went on to be a teacher and nonprofit executive. This seat is located in the expensive Philadelphia media market and Costello is a formidable fundraiser, so whoever challenges him will need access to plenty of money to have a good shot.\n\nMayoral\n\n Bolingbrook, IL Mayor: Tuesday's non-partisan race for mayor of the village of Bolingbrook (population 73,000) unexpectedly attracted national headlines after state and local progressives rallied against longtime incumbent Republican Roger Claar after he hosted a fundraiser for Trump. But Claar seems to have held on and defeated Will County Board member Jackie Traynere by 104 votes. There aren't many votes left to count, and Traynere's campaign doesn't seem to have much hope that the outcome will change.\n\n New Orleans, LA Mayor: New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu is termed out of office this year, and a so-called \"jungle\" primary to succeed him will be held on Oct. 14. All candidates will compete on one ballot, and if no one takes a majority, the top two vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 18 general election regardless of party. There's little question that Landrieu's successor will be a fellow Democrat in this very blue city, but it's far from clear who it will be. (And note: Because mayoral races kept coinciding with Mardi Gras season, this election was recently bumped up from February 2018 to October 2017; future races will take place every four years in October from now on.)\n\nThe filing deadline is July 14, and as is often the case in slow-moving Louisiana politics, the race may not fully take shape until then. Back in 2010, after initially announcing that he wouldn't run, Landrieu himself kicked off his successful campaign that year just days before the filing deadline. Landrieu was already one of the most prominent people in New Orleans politics so he could afford to change course at the last moment, but it's not uncommon in Louisiana for politicians to make their plans clear late in the cycle.\n\nThis year, two notable contenders have jumped in so far. Former Judge Michael Bagneris, who lost to Landrieu 64-33 in 2014, has announced that he'll run again, but his last campaign was decidedly unremarkable. However, City Councilor LaToya Cantrell announced last week that she would also run, and she's likely to be a formidable candidate.\n\nCantrell, who was the subject of an in-depth Politico Magazine profile a couple of years ago, rose to prominence for her work helping her neighborhood recover from Hurricane Katrina. She later won a city council seat in a 2012 special election by defeating an opponent who was backed by both Landrieu and Rep. Cedric Richmond, who represents New Orleans in Congress. On the council, Cantrell is perhaps best known for spearheading a successful drive in 2015 to ban smoking in bars and casinos. She'd also be New Orleans' first female mayor.\n\nShe's likely to face more competition, though, since a number of other Democrats are eyeing the race. State Sen. J.P. Morrell, who hails from a prominent local political family, says he's \"very interested,\" and The Advocate says he's expected to announce his plans in mid-May. State Rep. Walt Leger also recently formed a new campaign committee that allows him to raise money for a mayoral race, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that he's \"expected to announce his candidacy soon.\"\n\nHowever, Leger and Morrell are close, and it's possible one of them will decide not to run. Leger also has a prominent profile: He has served as speaker pro tem of the GOP-dominated state House since 2012 (such odd arrangements are still a feature of state politics), and last year, newly-elected Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards selected him to be speaker. In Louisiana, the governor traditionally chooses the legislature's leaders, but the GOP caucus (as well as one rogue Democrat) balked at letting a Democrat run the chamber, and Leger narrowly lost.\n\nState Sen. Troy Carter has expressed interest, too, and he's close to Richmond, who is an important presence in city politics. Carter is a longtime politician who has served in the state House, on the city council, and in various government consulting jobs since 1991. However, Carter performed badly during his 2002 mayoral campaign and in two races a decade ago for the House seat now held by Richmond.\n\nBut waitthere's still more! Municipal Court Judge Desiree Charbonnet, who, like Morrell, hails from a well-connected family, previously said no to a mayoral bid, but she's reportedly reconsidering. And bombastic rich guy Sidney Torres IV, who stars in a reality TV show that features him as a real estate investor/guru, is talking about jumping in, and says he'd spend $4 million of his own money.\n\nTorres, who also is a member of a prominent political family (but one that hails from nearly St. Bernard Parish) and is known for creating an app that purportedly helps fight crime in the French Quarter, cuts a decidedly Trump-esque profile that he readily embraces. He even bragged to the New York Times that he was asked to move his private jet because Trump wanted to use the same hanger for a campaign rally! But Orleans Parish gave 81 percent of its vote to Hillary Clinton last year, so this may not be the best city for a candidate looking to emulate President Agent Orange.\n\nAnd even after running through this extensive list, there are still several other New Orleans politicians whose names have been mentioned in the local press, so the roster of hopefuls could still grow further.\n\nAs for the race itself, the city's high crime rate is a perennial election issue, and it likely will remain so this year. Race is also often a fault line in local elections, though not always. African Americans are 57 percent of registered voters here while white voters make up 35 percent of the electorate, and black politicians have tended to dominate the landscape. However, in 2010, Landrieu became New Orleans' first white mayor since his father, Moon Landrieu, left office in 1978, so race is not destiny here.\n\nAnd given the potential size of the field and the lack of a single dominant candidate, it's impossible to forecast how the vote might split. Bagneris, Cantrell, Morrell, Carter, and Charbonnet are all black, while Leger and Torres are white.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/6/1650585/-Morning-Digest-Nebraska-Democrats-have-a-great-chance-to-oust-Omaha-s-Republican-mayor-next-month#read-more", "date": "2017/4/6"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Thursday, April 6, 2017\n\nNote: Today is C&J's annual Random Religious Objection Day!

Paris Climate Agreement signatories to Trump: Our hands are bigger than yours. \"The Paris Agreement remains a remarkable achievement, universally supported by all countries when it was adopted,\" Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat in Bonn, wrote in a letter to staff.  Espinosa listed signs of \"worldwide momentum\" including that \"solar power capacity globally grew 50 percent in 2016 led by the United States and China\" and that ever more governments were passing laws to curb global warming. \"This governmental momentum continues to be underpinned by companies, investors, cities, regions and territories including now many oil majors whose CEOs have in recent weeks publicly spoken out in support of the Paris Agreement,\" she said.\n\nTrump says he plans to issue a sternly-worded response just as soon as he hears what it is on Fox News.\n\nJEERS to weasel words.

They swear they only have your best interest at heart. (With fingers crossed behind their back.) Lets set the record straight. Verizon does not sell the personal web browsing history of our customers. We dont do it, and thats the bottom line, Verizons chief privacy officer, Karen Zacharia, said in a company blog posting. A Comcast statement echoed the Verizon position. We do not sell our broadband customers individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCCs rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so, Gerard Lewis, chief general counsel and privacy officer, wrote on Comcasts corporate website.\n\nI'll feel better when they start saying \"We will never sell,\" \"we wont ever do it,\" and \"we will never make plans to do so.\" Until then, I'll just assume that whenever it rains outside it's telco drool falling from the sky.\n\nCHEERS to great moments in synthetics.

Apparently, if one is to believe those silly robed gooses, taxpaying citizens who happen to be LGB or T have just as much right to be treated as equally under the law as everyone else who already is:\n\n\"We conclude today that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination,\" Judge Diane Wood wrote for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. ...but not if the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling holds up. The ruling is a victory for Kimberly Hively, who sued Ivy Tech Community College, arguing that the school violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it denied her employment. \"Any discomfort, disapproval, or job decision based on the fact that the complainant---woman or man---dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex,\" Wood wrote. \"That means that it falls within Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination, if it affects employment in one of the specified ways,\" Wood added.\n\nThe money quote from the ruling, which will likely go to the Supreme Court next: \"It would require considerable calisthenics to remove the 'sex' from 'sexual orientation.'\" I guess that explains why Roberts, Alito and Thomas have recently been seen arriving at the office with zumba balls under their arms.\n\nCheers also to the Mississippi State women for eating their Wheaties and ending UConns 111-game winning streak.\n\nCHEERS to order in a different kind of court.

Dionne Jr. at The Washington Post writesThe Gorsuch filibuster is about far more than payback:\n\nWhy are Democrats filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuch? Because theyve had enough with the politics of power-grabbing and bullying. At the root of this fight is a long-term conservative effort to dominate the Supreme Court and turn it to the political objectives of the right. This is thus about far more than retaliation, however understandable, for the Senate Republicans refusal to give even a hearing to Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee for the seat Gorsuch would fill. Behind the current judicial struggle lies a series of highly politicized Supreme Court rulings. It started with Bush v. Gore, when five conservative justices abruptly halted the recount of Floridas ballots in the 2000 election and made George W. Bush president. The unsigned majority opinion unmasked (to use the word of the moment) the unprincipled and unmistakably results-oriented nature of the decision with this lovely little sentence: Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.\n\nVanita Gupta and Corey Stoughton at The New York Times writeDont Let Jeff Sessions Undermine Police Reform:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered a review of federal agreements with a number of local law enforcement agencies aimed at reforming troubled departments. As a first step, the Justice Department on Monday asked a judge to delay a consent decree that would overhaul Baltimores police force. On its face, Mr. Sessionss order simply asks whether the consent decrees promote public safety, support officers, respect local control and are warranted. But underlying the order is the Trump administrations belief that efforts to align police practices with the Constitution have compromised public safety and thrown police officers under the bus. This couldnt be farther from the truth.\n\nEmily Atkin at the New Republic writesCan the White House Office of Science Survive Trump?\n\nWhen President Barack Obama took the White House in 2008, his knowledge of science was admittedly limited, but his interest in it wasnt. Within days of his election, he began selecting the scientists and tech wonks for his science advisory board, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The OSTP was fully staffed within months, and became the most active in history, starting 34 studies of subjects as varied as advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity, according to The New York Times. The office also advised Obama on relevant budgets, technological advancements, and policy goals, and organized an annual science fair for youngsters that produced reliably fun, nerdy videos in which, for instance, a student fires a marshmallow cannon inside the State Dining Room of the White House. Today, nearly three months into Donald Trumps presidency, OSTP is nearly empty. According to a report last week in The New York Times, the 24-person staff of the chief technology officer has been virtually deleted, and scores of career OSTP staffers have departed since Obama skipped town. [...] A bare-bones OSTP staff at this point is not unprecedented. President George W. Bush waited until June of his first year to select his science advisor. But amid endless accusations that Trump is waging a war on science, his lack of attention to OSTP concerns scientists such as Dr. John Holdren, the former OSTP director and Obamas chief science advisor.\n\nViv Groskop at The Guardian writesVulgar misogyny didnt harm Donald Trump  it helped him:\n\nI experienced this defence of the pussy first-hand recently after Piers Morgan retweeted something I wrote (to his five million followers). Morgan had questioned the validity of the womens marches and suggested a march for emasculated men. I replied I would come with him when a woman is recorded inviting similar abuse of mens genitals. (Except I said it more bluntly than that.) Trump supporters fought back in their exhausting hundreds. Their reasoning was fascinating. They had no problem with the pussy thing. For them it was not a comment on Trumps vulgarity or misogyny. It was a comment on how easy women are. They didnt focus, as liberals did, on the words grab them by the pussy. They heard the previous quote: When youre a star, they let you do it. It was a comment about people who have got it coming and who have had it coming for a long time. In other words, a bullys charter. How prescient the words grab them by the pussy turned out to be. Now its obvious that pussy stood for so much more than women.

This has become a very common refrain for Sanders specifically and the progressive left generally. After the election, Nation editor at large D.D. Guttenplan declared that liberal elites who spurned populism are responsible for President Donald Trump, while Chris Hedges argued last month that Trumps greatest allies are, unwittingly, liberal elites. The elites, who live in enclaves of privilege in cities such as New York, Washington and San Francisco, scold an enraged population, he wrote at Truthdig. They tell those they dismiss as inferiors to calm down, be reasonable and patient and trust in the goodness of the old ruling class and the American system. [...] But its worth asking: If all these full-throated attacks on liberal elitism ended with the ascension of a racist, sexist authoritarian who has a gross history of mistreating working people, then is attacking liberal elitism really the proper strategy for the opposition to Trump? Maybe the left should think about going back to attacking a more tried and true bugaboo: the wealthy.\n\nJonathan Freedlund at The Guardian writesInaction over Syria has exacted a terrible price:\n\nThe world made its decision on Syria  where more than 400,000 have been killed and millions upon millions have been turned into refugees  long ago. It concluded that it does not have the means or, crucially, the will to stop the agony. Anne-Marie Slaughter, formerly of the Obama administration, suggests a single strike that would crater, say, a runway used by Assads warplanes  not an invasion, not a full-scale military operation, but some way of punishing Syria for what it has done. But you know that will be deemed too much. That it would be vetoed at the security council and condemned as a violation of international law  even though, of course, Assad has himself broken international law, indeed broken a set of precious, century-old conventions and agreements that ban chemical weapons. A world without such a prohibition, a world where the use of chemical weapons goes unpunished, where it becomes routine, is a terrifying prospect. And yet, surely, Assads impunity is, at this very moment, being noted and filed away by the worlds most brutal regimes: the precedent is being set.

The Movement for Black Lives Delivers One:\n\nDuring the final year of his life, King was at his most radical in his politics and the most sweeping in his analysis. Emboldened to resist what he termed the triple evils of militarism, racism and poverty, King in his Beyond Vietnam speech offers a lesson for our own time. It is rich with provocative and relevant messages for the racial justice and economic justice movements, and the international solidarity work they require. Take, for example, his insistence that we wage a war on poverty rather than invest more human and financial resources in military aggression abroad. What demand could be more timely, give the promise by the 45th president to siphon an additional $54 billion [...] from public funds to further engorge the Pentagon budget? In the speech, King underscored the fierce urgency of now, and the need for this country to embrace a radical revolution of values. That revolution, of course, has yet to come, and its urgency has only increased. But Kings vision is resurgent in the coalition of Black-led organizations known as the Movement for Black Lives (MBL). Fittingly, on April 4, MBL, and dozens of allied organizations, is launching the Beyond the Moment campaign, which takes its name from Kings speech. It will kick off with massive political education events and a call for May Day demonstrations alongside labor, immigration and climate activists. The MBL Vision for Black Lives platform issued in August 2016 spells out what Kings radical revolution of values might look like. The platform echoes Kings visionin its demands for healthcare, housing and jobs and its critique of a system that place(s) profit over people. Two pivotal struggles were at the heart of Kings work during his final year: the Poor Peoples Campaign and the Memphis sanitation workers strike.\n\nDexter Filkins at The New Yorker writesTrumps Terrible Moment of Truth in Syria:\n\nNow comes the moment of truth for President Trump.

He also described the attack as a consequence of the past Administrations weakness and irresolution. What happens now? Trumps comment put forward no clear policy or planned response. During a press briefing on Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, strongly suggested that the Administration is preparing a military response in order to punish the Syrian government and deter it from carrying out any more chemical-weapons attacks. The Obama Administration took plenty of actions against the Assad government, including sending arms to rebel groups. But Obamas other aim, in addition to destroying isis, was to avoid a collapse of the Syrian statethe kind that might happen if the United States were to directly attack the Assad regime. Obama feared that the ensuing vacuum in Damascus would be filled by the likes of isis and the Al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. When Obama looked at Damascus in 2013, he saw Baghdad in 2003.\n\nx New Column: On the relentless daily mindf---k of trying to keep up w Trump outrages & scandals. https://t.co/k2AgDQn99s via @thedailybeast  Michael Tomasky (@mtomasky) April 5, 2017\n\nKate Aronoff at The Guardian writesNo, Ivanka Trump will not moderate her father. She will just strengthen him:\n\nThe main criticism leveraged against the President Trumps oldest daughter has been that she and her husband, Jared Kushner  now a senior Trump adviser  are complicit in what her father and his advisers are doing in the Oval Office. By virtue of being young, photogenic and not visibly unhinged, Ivanka and Jared have been painted as the great moderators  people with allegedly progressive views on things like womens rights and climate change, who can temper the effects of Trumps administration. Her interview on CBS News this morning should lay those rumours to rest. If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then Im complicit, the presidents oldest daughter shrugged. But as the interview shows, Ivanka is worse than complicit, and certainly no force for good. She serves a vital role in keeping her fathers administration afloat. Like Kushner and his adventures in the Middle East, Ivankas official capacity is ambiguous. Both have top-level security clearance, and have been sitting in on high-profile meetings between the president, various business leaders and foreign dignitaries since he was elected. Now shell have the first ladys office in the White House. Ivanka seems to talk a lot about Women Who Work, though exactly what shell do in that office remains undefined. Shes already an invaluable asset for her father: Ivanka feeds the illusion that the Trump administration contains moderate voices.\n\nRebecca Traister at New York Magazine writesOf Course Donald Trump Doesnt Think Bill OReilly Did Anything Wrong:\n\nBy every rational measure, Donald Trump Defends Bill OReilly on Sexual Harrassment Allegations should be the least surprising headline of any given day.

The Soviets viewed SDI as a first-strike system, one that would allow the United States to attack the USSR, taking out most of its missiles before they could be launched and having the capability of mopping up any surviving missiles as they rose toward orbit, striking them before they could release their warheads.\n\nAlthough certain kinds of space weapons, including the ridiculous X-ray laser promoted (and lied about) by physicist Edward Teller, were soon given up on, there is still the potential for building maneuverable satellites in orbit that can act as assassins of other satellites with lasers, bombs, or claws: anti-satellites, or ASATs. Despite an effort in the Cold War to negotiate restrictions on ASATs, no agreement was ever produced. In 2014, the U.S. began long-term research to develop ASATs for use against China or Russia.\n\nThe U.S. has ships equipped with Aegis radars that are capable of locking onto low-orbit satellites to target them for hits by the Navys hundreds of SM-3 antiballistic-missiles. In addition to these systems, the Pentagon is gearing up for more.\n\nMorina Koren at The Atlantic writesAmerica's Space Commanders Rattle Their Lightsabers:\n\nLast week, Navy Vice Admiral Charles Richard, the deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said during a conference in Washington, D.C., that while were not at war in space, I dont think we can say were exactly at peace, either. Major power competition is back on the table in a way that we have not seen in the world for perhaps 15 or 20 years, he said. Like Thompson, Richard said the U.S. should appear prepared. [T]he best way to prevent war is to be prepared for war, and were going to make sure that everyone knows were going to be prepared to fight and win wars in all domains, to include space, he said. [...] And earlier in March, General David Goldfein, the chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, told The Washington Post in an interview that the military branch wants to maintain ensure space superiority, which he defined as freedom from attack and freedom to maneuver. [...] If war breaks out, it will be fought amongst the hundreds of communications, weather, navigation, and reconnaissance satellites circling Earth. Satellites can be destroyed by ground-based missiles, disabled by lasers, hacked by actors on Earth to knock out transmissions, or stalked and beaten up by spacecraft designed to hunt enemy hardware. There are currently about 1,400 operational satellites orbiting the planet at various altitudes, according to a database maintained by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an American nonprofit group. The U.S. dominates the field with nearly 576 satellites, compared to Russias 140 and Chinas 181. The U.S. has an edge, but having more assets can mean more vulnerabilities.\n\nIn his prepared remarks at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs this week, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces subcommittee, said he envisions a\n\nseparate Space Force within the Department of Defense, just like the Air Force, which had to be separated from the Army in order to be prioritized and become a world-class military service. Simply put, space must be a priority and it cant be one if you jump out of bed in the morning thinking about fighters and bombers first.

For those unfamiliar, Brown is a singer, songwriter, dancer and sometimes actor, who has been very successful, with multiple Billboard hits. However, Browns fame is tainted by the fact he also has a long record of being an abusive asshole, most notably a brutal felony assault against then-girlfriend Rihanna. And some recent reports seem to indicate Brown still has a problem with controlling his temper with significant others.\n\nCreated by Kenya Barris, Black-ish has been notable as a television show by being meta by portraying the perceptions of what it means to be black, or arguably anything other than white, in popular culture and society at large, along with the expectations that come with it. Theres an inherent bias, in society and on television, which values white and male as being the default, and any deviation from the default is considered special and noteworthy to the point of reclassifying it if someone has a high enough melanin count or lacking a penis. Its no longer just a good movie, its a good black movie, or a good feminist movie with all of the stigmas and marketing biases which exist within those stereotypes.\n\nBut when Black-ish attempted to use Brown to make a point about the disparities in popular culture where men are oblivious to how they mistreat women, it struck some as a galling misstep for a TV show that should know better. And I guess, in an ironic way, Black-ish kinda proved its own point unintentionally. The debate over Browns appearance on the show opened interesting discussions as to race, both inside the black community (where the defense of Brown depends on rationalizations similar to Bill Cosby has done so much for this community) and double standards in comparison to it, as well as how wealth fits into the calculus of the whole thing.\n\nBecause the truth is that if youre white and wealthy the rationalizations come fast and furious too. Allegations of sexual harassment did not hurt Casey Afflecks chances of winning a Best Actor Oscar, nor did abuse allegations and a history of anti-Semitic remarks dissuade or put people off from recognizing Mel Gibsons talent as a director.\n\nAnd, on even larger stages, there are rationalizations for a news network personality and the president of the United States, who has already told us how he likes to grab things. And were all supposed to pretend we dont know it when they play Hail to the Chief. And somehow it becomes okay because some other asshole did something too and may have gotten away with it.

The dumbest thing I ever did was get you the job at CNN  you are the most disloyal person. Just remember, I always seem to find a way to get even. Best wishes, Donald J. Trump.\n\nEmphasis added.

Ex-state Department of Health and Environmental Control chief Catherine Templeton, who made a name for herself with conservatives by fighting unions across the country, declared that she would run on Tuesday.\n\nTempleton originally planned to kick off her bid in January for what she assumed would be the race to succeed the termed-out Haley, but after McMaster became governor, she postponed her announcement. In the end, though, she decided to go for it, hours after GOP Sen.

Still, well be listening, too.\n\nTheres also a third candidate in the race, Yancey McGill, a party-switching former Democratic state senator who briefly served as lieutenant governor in 2014 and announced he would run last year. McMasters promotion doesnt appear to have altered McGills plans, though he doesnt seem like a major foe. However, he could still have an impact even if he only takes a small share of the vote, because South Carolina requires primary candidates to win a majority in order to avoid a runoff.\n\nAnd it wont be easy for Templeton (or McGill) to convince a majority of primary voters that, now that McMaster is governor, they should go ahead and fire him.

This can cause the polar jet stream to get stuck in an unusual, slower-moving, more meandering pattern. When that happens, sometimes for weeks at a time, a persistent weather event such as flooding or drought is more likely.\n\nxaxnar writesBBC Shows How Climate Change is Happening NOW in Miami Beach: BBC Future has a grim look at what is happening now in Florida: Miamis Fight Against Rising Seas. Not a hundred years from now. Not 50 or 30  now. The first time my fathers basement flooded, it was shortly after he moved in. The building was an ocean-front high-rise in a small city north of Miami called Sunny Isles Beach. The marble lobby had a waterfall that never stopped running; crisp-shirted valets parked your car for you. For the residents who lived in the more lavish flats, these cars were often BMWs and Mercedes. But no matter their value, the cars all wound up in the same place: the basement. When I called, Id ask my dad how the building was doing. The basement flooded again a couple weeks ago, hed sometimes say. Or: Its getting worse. Its not only his building: hes also driven through a foot of water on a main road a couple of towns over and is used to tiptoeing around pools in the local supermarkets car park. Ask nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and theyll have an anecdote to share. Many will also tell you that its happening more and more frequently. The data backs them up. The article by Amanda Ruggeri is a wide-ranging look at Miami Beach and the surrounding areas as rising seas bring more and more King tides, low lying areas cant drain, streets flood, sea walls fail, and more.\n\nMark Sumner writesOn climate change, Scott Pruitt follows the lead of Vladimir Putin: Just ask what generates the greatest profit for existing CEOs of existing corporations without one thought to how it affects workers, the public, or the future and its easy to predict the rights position on almost any subject. Dont let thoughts of improving technology, shifting needs, or any trend longer than a week interfere. All that information is discarded. To disseminate these positions, the right depends on strong leaders to set the guidelines that the rest will follow. On climate change, leaderships position is clear. Vladimir Putin has said humans are not to blame for climate change - and that the melting of the ice in the Arctic could be used for Russia's economic ends. Yes, yes, there may be less ice here and there, and winters may be warmer but  thats a good thing. Certainly not the fault of humans that pump 10 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually.\n\nClimateDenierRoundup writesFree Market Advocates Give Away Denial Book, But Will Teachers Buy the Propaganda? As reported by Frontlines Katie Worth last week, Heartland has started sending thousands of teachers across the country copies of a DVD and its book Why scientists disagree about global warming. ( Free pdf download here , or inside it says you can pay between $8.95 and $14.95 per copy, depending on how many you order...) Now, given that science teachers tend to not be complete idiots, this isnt going to be taken at face value by teachers (as evidenced by Washington Post Angela Fritzs poll of her social media followers). One environmental science teacher from South Carolina put it perfectly : The Heartland Institute is about as good at putting teacher materials together as they are at interpreting science. Not seeing many educators being convinced by any of that hot mess. [...]So were inclined to agree with Greg Ladens suggestion that this was a huge waste of money and effort. Because at the bulk price of $8.95, some sucker gave Heartland a pretty penny to distribute 200,000 copies to teachers across the country. Just think about what that could have paid for instead- a lot of school supplies for underfunded teachers.\n\nClimateDenierRoundup writesLack of Facts Shouldnt Hold You Back from Talking Smack, Say Denier Flacks: Last week, Dr. David Whitehouse, advisor to the UKs premier climate denial shop, GWPF, made a shockingly frank admission in a comment to a Parliamentary report on science communications and the media. Apparently, Whitehouse thinks freedom of speech includes misleading the public by making factually inaccurate statements. Given that GWPF had to spin off a political advocacy arm after the Charity Commission determined it was blurring the line between education and political spin, this quote is surprising only in its honesty. DeSmogUKs Mat hope reports a couple of other details from Whitehouses comments. For one, he failed to disclose his affiliation with GWPF- whatre you ashamed of, David? And then, cementing his anti-science position, Whitehouse argued that the media gives too much authority to papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Fortunately, the House of Commons' Science and Technology committee ignored Whitehouses plea to protect lies in its  Science Communication Inquiry . Instead, the final report, which focuses on how science is reported in the media, quotes actual scientists and experts, like those at the Royal Society and Science Media Center.\n\nrktect writesThe Arctic Sea Ice Reduction since 1978 is 4 x10^6 km2 half of which is since 2016: Its true that not all the sea ice is gone yet, but much of what remains is thin enough that the light passing through it is allowing algae blooms. In many places it is cracked and subject to being broken up by storms which due to the extremes of heat and cold confronting eachother in that region have extremes of wind and wave. [...] The Jacobshaven Glacier delivering 10% of the ice melt from Greenlands ice caps to the sea no longer flows at a glacial pace but rather is retreating at 10 km/yr with the rate of retreat increasing at an increasing rate just as with the sea ice. Instead of climate changing over millennia we are now seeing it change in ways we can observe with our own eyes in the course of a season. Even as some scientists are still looking at what happened during the second half of the 20th century at a scale of change over decades others are beginning to address the significant acceleration of changes observed year by year.\n\n7th term is small writesYale Climate Opinion Maps: Darksydes March 3rd This week in science post included a reference to the Yale Climate Opinion Maps which are worth a little time and can be found here. The maps show what you would expect. Larger percentages of the population in urban areas believe global warming is happening. Smaller percentages in rural areas. There is a Latino effect (which I heard about on NPR). As a group, Hispanics take climate change seriously and it shows on the maps. The maps can viewed by state, county or congressional district. I found the congressional district view to be the most interesting because it turns out there is not a single congressional district where the majority believes global warming isnt happening. Or, to restate without the double negative, (which will make my sister the English teacher happy), a majority in every congressional district in the United States believe climate change is happening. This means different things to different people. To me it means I havent entirely wasted the last 15 years of my life (I am a science teacher). To a climate change denier, it means he is losing or perhaps has lost the battle for American public opinion.\n\nOCEANS, WATER, DROUGHT\n\nDartagnan writesTrump Threatens to Kill The Chesapeake Bay: The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in North America, with more than 150 major rivers and streams flowing into its basin, extended into six states. Its name may derive from the Algonquin Chesepioc, which refers to a village at a big river, or from the native Chesepians or Chesapeakes, who inhabited the area now known as South Hampton Roads in Virginia. The Bay is a prime tourist attraction for fishing, sailing, swimming, kayaking, and is well-known for its seafood production, mainly blue crabs, clams and oysters. As a major link in the Intracoastal Waterway of inlets, rivers, bays and sounds that form a navigable route down the Eastern seaboard, it contributes mightily to the commerce as well as the ecology of the region. Its preservation should be a point of pride for all Americans who care about this countrys natural beauty. But as beautiful as it is, the Bay has had its problems. Just six years ago nearly one-third of the Bay was afflicted with a springtime dead zone of oxygen-starved water resulting from fertilizer and chemical runoff. The damage to aquatic life was staggering96% of the oyster harvest disappeared along with over half of the crab harvest, as huge areas of the bay entered into a human-induced death spiral.\n\nLib Dem FoP writesNew Filter Removes Salt from Sea Water: Desalination plants are expensive and demand large amounts of power to remove salt from sea water. A new invention could replace that. The National Graphene Institute at the University of Manchester, England has announced that their scientists have developed a filter that removes salt from sea water. Previously graphene sheet filters failed because the tiny holes expanded in water to allow the salt to pass. Graphene-oxide membranes developed at the National Graphene Institute have already demonstrated the potential of filtering out small nanoparticles, organic molecules, and even large salts. Until now, however, they couldnt be used for sieving common salts used in desalination technologies, which require even smaller sieves. Previous research at The University of Manchester found that if immersed in water, graphene-oxide membranes become slightly swollen and smaller salts flow through the membrane along with water, but larger ions or molecules are blocked.\n\nWILDERNESS, NATIONAL FORESTS AND PARKS & OTHER PUBLIC LANDS\n\nOWCH writesIs Trump's \"paycheck donation\" to the National Park service all wrong? Yeah, the PussyGrabber-in-Chief followed through on ONE (maybe), maybe one campaign promise, to donate his POTUS salary. Although $78k is a lot of money to most people, its a drop in the bucket for him. Too bad he cant write a check and make RussiaGate, TrumpRyanCare, and every other broken promise he made go way just as easily. Anyways, take a look at the check above, of the so-called proof of honoring his commitment. I am not an accountant, just a regular schmuck thats written a check or two in my time.  Why is it written directly the National Park Service? Can you even send money directly to a Department? Every time I write a check to the government (a lot this time of year), it goes directly to the United States Treasury, who is then responsible for disbursing funds.

Brown, at a press conference with Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de Len, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and labor, business and local leaders on March 30, claimed the $5 billion-a-year program will cost most drivers less than $10 a month and comes with strict new accountability provisions to ensure funds can only be spent on transportation. California has a massive backlog of broken infrastructure that has been neglected far too long, said Governor Brown. Fixing the roads will not get cheaper by waiting  or ignoring the problem. This is a smart plan that will improve the quality of life in California. [...] While acknowledging the urgent need to fix Californias roads, Liza Tucker of the Santa Monica-Based Consumer Watchdog said the funds for repairing California roads should come from the oil companies windfall profits and not from consumers.\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\n\nMeteor Blades writesPennsylvania judge tosses out jury's verdict and $4.24 million damages award in fracking lawsuit: A U.S. magistrate judge has rejected a jurys March 2016 decision to award more than $4 million to two families in Dimock, Pennsylvania, who claimed their well water had been tainted by methane released from underground rock formations by hydraulic fracturingfracking. Concluding among other things that the scientific evidence presented in court was contradictory and didnt back up the claims of damage, Judge Martin Carlson sent the case back for retrial. But first, he stated, the two families should work with the companyCabot Oil & Gasto arrive at a settlement. Of the 40 families who sued Cabot in 2009, these two are the only ones who have not settled.

These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution.\n\nRepeating his accusations that Obama had left him a mess, Trump declared that he was very flexible and:\n\nI like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I dont have to have one specific way and if the world changes, I change and that attack on children had a big impact on me. Big impact.

In questioning, Trump declared that this flexibility had led him to change his mind on Assad and on Syria. However, he refused to say what he would do. Instead he complained again about the openness with which the Obama administration had discussed the upcoming attack on Mosul, implying that that openness had made the fight more difficult. Instead, he promised that action would be taken, though would not say what kind of action.\n\nMilitarily im not going to say where im going and what Im doing.  They will have a message. You will see what the message will be. Okay?\n\nOne thing that was immediately odd about Trumps discussion of Syria was that he did not once mention Russia. Where Nikki Haleys talk frequently called Russia to task for Putins support of Assad and direct involvement in Syria, Trump carefully avoided mentioning the country thats been propping up the Assad regime. Even when asked a question about working with Russia against terrorists in the region, Trump avoided saying the R-word. Instead, he said that ...\n\nThe United states will work with whoever its appropriate to deal with to eradicate ISIS and other terrorists. We will do whatever we have to do to eradicate terrorists.\n\nThe result of all this, a day after the attacks? Tillerson remains cold, disconnected, and disinterested in anything not attached to a drilling platform. Nikki Haley seems passionate, but isolated enough that its not clear who approved her speech.

However, theres something even more important to Trump on the line this time.\n\nA win. Trump needs one. Bigly.\n\nAssads chemical attack is an obvious test for Trump, and Syria is a much more convenient opponent than the other place where his team has been exchanging saber rattlesNorth Korea. Assad not only lacks nuclear weapons, he doesnt have a huge allied city under the gun, as does Kim Jong-un. So long as Trump restrains his attack to avoid dragging Russian forces into the conflict, he can deliver a punch in Syria, then step back and declare victory. Trump might even take out some portion of Assads helicopter force near the Idlib Province, which could relieve some pressure on rebels there.\n\nIn any case, that an attack is coming seems almost certain.\n\nIt crossed a lot of lines for me.

There will be no repercussions. Tennessee not only has no statewide protections for gay and transgender people, but state law also prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting pro-LGBTQ nondiscrimination policies. Apparently that didnt go far enough toward ensuring the ability to discriminate for Green. His bill aims to foreclose any opening local jurisdictions might use to encourage equitable treatment based on which businesses with which they choose to contract. But the measure isnt limited to LGBTQ issuesit would also bar municipalities from only contracting with companies that cover contraception, for instance.\n\nWhy is it that Republicans always decry state interference in local affairs except for when it comes to LGBTQ and abortion issues.

The documents show that several passages from the tenth chapter of his 2006 book, \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\" read nearly verbatim to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. In several other instances in that book and an academic article published in 2000, Gorsuch borrowed from the ideas, quotes and structures of scholarly and legal works without citing them. [] \"Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I've never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,\" said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue. Elizabeth Berenguer, an associate professor of law at Campbell Law School, said that under legal or academic standards Gorsuch's similarities to the Indiana Law Journal would be investigated \"as a potential violation of our plagiarism policy. It's similar enough to the original work.\"\n\nAnother professor, Duke's Keiran Healy tweets that \"Gorsuch's citations-at-one-remove read like a thing people commonly do when they want to look more scholarly/rigorous than they really are.\"\n\nBut the White House offered their own \"experts\" to talk to Politico, who unsurprisingly \"asserted that the criteria for citing work in dissertations on legal philosophy is different than for other types of academia or journalism: While Gorsuch may have borrowed language or facts from others without attribution, they said, he did not misappropriate ideas or arguments.\" Political scientist Dan Drezner scoffs at that notion: \"Compared to the social sciences, legal scholarship footnotes EVERYTHING. Practically every sentence. It's a thing we joke about.\" It's a thing, he points out, that law professor Orin Kerr jokes about.\n\nSo, yeah, the \"originalist\" Gorsuch is actually pretty much just another right-wing hack whose thinking actually reflects a hodgepodge of ideas from other people and comments he's strung together.

The majority said, 'We intend to pack the court of the United States of America,'\" he said. \"It was a warfare tactic of partisanship.\" As the protest neared its eighth hour early Wednesday morning, the senator pointed to Gorsuch's past rulings that some have deemed anti-women and anti-worker, including his decision in the Hobby Lobby case that found businesses don't have to provide contraceptive services to their employees.\n\nA cloture vote will still happen on Thursday, when Democrats will have the votes to block it going forward.

Dan Coats, has the connections to mount a serious race. Among the more well-known Republicans, Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita have both said that they're thinking about challenging Donnelly, while several other Republican officeholders are potential candidates too.\n\n ME-Sen: Just days after he formed an exploratory committee, GOP state Sen. Eric Brakey announced on Tuesday that he would challenge Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. Brakey, who will turn 30 a few months before Election Day, was Ron Paul's state director in 2012, when Paul came close to winning the state caucus. Brakey unseated a Democratic incumbent two years later and was Rand Paul's state chair in 2016. (The younger Paul's campaign died long before that year's Maine caucus.) Brakey debuted with a pretty obnoxious video that begins with a narrator declaring, \"Down in D.C., there's a king.\" With such clever wordplay, how can Brakey lose?\n\nWhile Trump almost won Maine, King doesn't look especially vulnerable. GOP Gov. Paul LePage has been flirting with a Senate bid for years and if he gets in, Brakey probably won't have an easy time beating him. Of course, there's never any telling what LePage will do.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n GA-Gov: When Republican Lynn Westmoreland announced that he was retiring from the House last year, he immediately acknowledged he was considering a 2018 run for governor. Westmoreland hasn't taken the plunge yet, and while he isn't ruling anything out, he doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic about a campaign.\n\nIn a recent interview, Westmoreland said he's \"not ready to make that decision,\" and added that while \"[e]verybody wants to get people committed. But at the same time, I'm not ready. The stars just haven't aligned for me to be able to do that. I'm happy. I am really and truly happy.\" Westmoreland also noted how he didn't miss fundraising while in Congress, adding that, \"when you spend a day a week trying to raise money, it's not fun.\" A gubernatorial campaign would certainly require a lot more of that anti-fun activity, and Westmoreland doesn't seem to have an appetite for it. The good news is if Westmoreland is done with politics, he'll finally have the time to memorize the Ten Commandments.\n\n NH-Gov: We may get a full-fledged reunion tour for the 2016 Democratic gubernatorial primary next year. Mark Connolly, a former state securities regulator, says that while he doesn't \"have any plans to run for governor,\" he'll consider after the state budget is done. Connolly's last bid didn't exactly go well, though. In 2016, he lost the primary to then-Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern, the establishment favorite, by a brutal 51-20, while ex-Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand took 25. Connolly did not endear himself to us during that campaign, either. Over a year after Connolly's old frat at Dartmouth College, Alpha Delta, was booted from campus for a hazing ritual where pledges were branded, Connolly sent out a fundraising email to his fraternity brothers calling for Alpha Delta to be reinstated.\n\nA few days ago, Marchand expressed interest in a second bid for governor. Van Ostern, who narrowly lost last year's general to Republican Chris Sununu, so far hasn't said if he's also thinking about a second run. However, Van Ostern hasn't exactly kept a low profile since the election. A few weeks ago, Van Ostern was at a phone bank organized by Save the Children Action Network to advocate for Concord to expand its all-day kindergarten. Van Ostern also still seems to be active in local Democratic politics, and he recently used his email list to fundraise for Manchester mayoral candidate Joyce Craig. That doesn't mean Van Ostern is considering a rematch with Sununu, but it's definitely the type of thing that candidates do to maintain connections with the party faithful between elections.\n\n NJ-Gov: On Monday, candidate filing closed for the June 6 primary to succeed termed-out GOP Gov. Chris Christie, and there were no surprises for either party.\n\nOn the Democratic side, ex-Ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive backed by New Jersey's powerful party establishment, continues to look like the clear frontrunner. Murphy will face ex-Undersecretary of the Treasury Jim Johnson; state Sen. Ray Lesniak; Assemblyman John Wisniewski; and Tenafly Councilor Mark Zinna. Murphy is very wealthy and well-connected, and will have little trouble spending money in this very expensive state. Both Johnson and Wisniewski did raise the $400,000 minimum they needed to qualify for the state's two-for-one matching funds, though. Under this system, candidates receive $2 for every $1 they raise, but they're not allowed to spend more than $6.4 million in the primary. Lesniak conceded weeks ago that he would not raise nearly enough money to qualify for matching funds, while Zinna has barely registered in this race at all.\n\nWith Christie posting horrific approval ratings, the GOP nomination may not be an incredibly valuable prize. Still, there's a contested primary, with Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli looking like the only credible candidates; both have qualified for matching funds. In New Jersey, counties can select a candidate to run on their county line, which gives them a prominent place at the top of the county's primary ballot. While Murphy earned all 21 county lines in the Democratic primary, the GOP side has been more competitive. Guadagno won 14 county endorsements, including in voter-rich Bergen, Monmouth, and Ocean. However, Ciattarelli did score some wins, which could allow him to get his name out.\n\n SC-Gov: Republican Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster became governor of South Carolina earlier this year after Nikki Haley left to serve as Donald Trump's UN ambassador. However, McMaster will still need to win next year's primary if he wants to keep his new job, and he picked up a credible opponent this week. Ex-state Department of Health and Environmental Control chief Catherine Templeton, who made a name for herself with conservatives by fighting unions across the country, declared that she would run on Tuesday.\n\nTempleton originally planned to kick off her bid in January for what she assumed would be the race to succeed the termed-out Haley, but after McMaster became governor, she postponed her announcement. In the end, though, she decided to go for it, hours after GOP Sen. Tim Scott said it was very unlikely he would join the contest.\n\nScott told The Post and Courier that he could \"best serve the people of South Carolina in the office that I was elected to, and if something changes, there will be a clear indication.\" Scott later elaborated that this \"clear indication\" presents itself in the form of \"an audible voice from God.\" Scott is high-profile enough that he may be able to enter the race late if he changes his mind, but it doesn't sound like he's inclined to. Still, we'll be listening, too.\n\nThere's also a third candidate in the primary, Yancey McGill, a party-switching former Democratic state senator who briefly served as lieutenant governor in 2014 and announced he would run last year. McMaster's promotion doesn't appear to have altered McGill's plans, though he doesn't seem like a major foe. However, he could still have an impact even if he only takes a small share of the vote, because South Carolina requires primary candidates to win a majority in order to avoid a runoff.\n\nAnd it won't be easy for Templeton (or McGill) to convince a majority of primary voters that, now that McMaster is governor, they should go ahead and fire him. Still, an unfolding corruption investigation involving McMaster's longtime allies could make things interesting. The State recently reported that agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division raided the offices of a powerful Republican consulting firm called Richard Quinn & Associates a few weeks ago. No charges have been filed against owner Richard Quinn or anyone else from his group. But last month, an influential GOP state senator, John Courson, was indicted for allegedly using contributions from the Quinn group for his personal use.\n\nIf things could get worse, it could hurt McMaster at the ballot box. McMaster is very close to Quinn, keeping the firm on as consultants throughout all this. And they go back a long way: RQ&A helped McMaster salvage his 2000 re-election campaign as South Carolina Republican Party chair. The party was in bad financial shape, but just before the vote, RQ&A and another firm contributed a total of $85,000 to the GOP's coffers. The party then released letters showing it had plenty of money in the bank, and McMaster won another term. But just days before the vote, the money was all wired back in secretinformation that didn't come out until long after the election.\n\nIf RQ&A earns some more ugly headlines, Templeton will have a much easier time portraying McMaster as a part of a corrupt establishment that needs to goand that could make for a competitive primary where, just a couple of months ago, we weren't expecting one at all.\n\nHouse\n\n GA-06: On Tuesday, we got two different polls of the April 18 all-party primary, and they both show Democrat Jon Ossoff in the low 40s, a bit away from the majority he needs to win this seat outright without a June runoff. The progressive activist group MoveOn has released a new poll from Lake Research, making this the first survey we've seen from the Democratic side. MoveOn's poll finds Ossoff, whom they endorsed last month, leading the way with 40 percent of the vote, while Republican Karen Handel is second with 18 and 19 percent are undecided (no other candidate breaks out of single digits). And in a hypothetical runoff matchup, Ossoff and Handel are tied at 45.\n\nA new SurveyUSA poll for local TV station WXIA finds similar results, with Ossoff at 43 and Handel at 15. The race for second place is a lot tighter here, though, with Republican Bob Gray at 14 (Gray took just 7 in MoveOn's poll). Handel, a former state secretary of state who is the nominal establishment favorite, claimed to WXIA that \"her internal polling shows her beating her Republican counterparts by double digits,\" but she declined to actually share it, so perhaps Gray, who has the backing of the Club for Growth, can overtake her.\n\nWhile on one level both these polls are positiveOssoff is in frontit's still somewhat surprising that MoveOn would want to release their survey. In recent days, all the chatter has been about the possibility that Ossoff could clear 50 percent in the primary and avoid a second roundsomething Republicans are openly fretting about. But Lake's data suggests Ossoff is quite a ways away from scoring a first-round knockout, especially since those undecideds are apt to lean Republican, given this district's demographics. SurveyUSA's poll shows Ossoff in better shape, but still quite a bit away from a majority with two weeks to go.\n\nStill, we have relatively little polling to go on, and the influx of GOP money indicates some real worry. Between the NRCC and the Congressional Leadership Fund, Republicans are now reportedly spending over $4 million to try and stop Ossoff. That speaks at least as loud as any surveys.\n\n IL-03: Marketing consultant Marie Newman said last month that she'd formed an exploratory committee to examine a primary challenge against conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, and now she's taken a step further and filed paperwork (a so-called \"statement of candidacy\") with the FEC. For progressives eager to take another shot at the recalcitrant Lipinski, a bid by Newman would be welcome indeed. Illinois' 3rd Congressional District, located in the Chicago suburbs, voted for Hillary Clinton 55-40, so it could easily host a much better Democrat than the current incumbent. (Hat-tip: Greg Giroux)\n\n MN-01: Democratic Rep. Tim Walz recently announced a run for governor, and several names from both parties have surfaced as possible candidates to succeed him. This southern Minnesota district backed Trump by a daunting 53-38 spread, but it has historically been relatively swingy at the presidential level. Morning Take now reports that Republican state Rep. Joe Schomacker is considering a bid, but there's no word from Schomacker himself. Thus far, Democratic state Sen. Nick Frentz, Olmsted County Republican Party Chair Aaron Miller, and GOP state Rep. Nels Pierson have all previously said that they're considering it, while 2014 and 2016 Republican nominee Jim Hagedorn is already in the race.\n\n MN-07: Longtime Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson's 7th District in western Minnesota is by far Trump's best House district that Democrats hold, having favored him by a brutal 62-31 edge after Mitt Romney won it by a smaller 54-44 margin in 2012. Despite spending less than $20,000, veritable some dude Dave Hughes held Peterson to just a 52-47 win in 2016, thanks largely to Trump's landslide there. Although Hughes previously announced he would seek a rematch in 2018, the district's red hue could help lure bigger-name Republican candidates into the race. Indeed, Morning Take recently reported that GOP state Rep. Tim Miller has \"made the rounds in D.C.\" and is telling people that he is running, although Miller hasn't declared anything publicly yet.\n\nPeterson is no stranger to running challenging races in what has long been a relatively Republican-leaning district, though. He faced a highly touted state senator in the Republican-favoring year of 2014, yet nonetheless prevailed 54-46. However, this district is overwhelmingly white, heavily rural, and has a relatively low share of voters with a college degree, making it prime Trump territory. Peterson himself hasn't even decided if he will run for a 15th term next year, and Democrats would be hard pressed to hold his seat if the 72-year-old retires. If Peterson does run again, he'll be a formidable candidate, but in an era of declining ticket-splitting, even he might not be able to escape his district's lean.\n\n MT-AL: Democrat Rob Quist has released his first TV ad for the May 25 special election for Montana's at-large congressional seat, and he hits exactly the themes you'd expect. \"There's nearly 300 millionaires in Congress, but not one Montana folk singer,\" Quist says to viewers, in a jab at his uber-rich Republican rival, Greg Gianforte. He goes on: \"After a career using my voice for the Montana we love, I will be a voice for you.\" Quist then vows to \"defend public lands from private developers,\" fight on behalf of farmers and ranchers, and support \"healthcare we can afford.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gianforte is also out with a second ad. In this spot, he complains about Washington, D.C. having \"the highest incomes in America\" (Republicans don't usually complain about people earning lots of money), saying that \"D.C. insiders have rigged the system to cash in at your expense.\" Gianforte then says he wants to \"drain the swamp\" by instituting term limits, banning members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and withholding their paychecks unless they balance the budget. There's no word on the size of either ad buy.\n\nLegislative\n\n VA State House: Virginia's entire 100-member state House is up this fall. The GOP holds a huge 66 to 34 majority in the chamber, but Hillary Clinton carried 51 seats, including 17 GOP-held districts, and Old Dominion Democrats are hoping to make major gains this year. In 2015, 44 Republicans won their general elections without opposition. But according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Democrats have at least one candidate in 82 seats this time as of last week's filing deadline. It's possible some of those remaining districts will have a candidate as well, since the party has until the June 13 primary to select a nominee for those currently-uncontested seats through other means.\n\nOther Races\n\n VA-LG: With Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam leaving this office behind to run for governor, both Republicans and Democrats are hosting three-way June 13 primaries to succeed him. Lieutenant governor races often don't earn much attention, but this contest is important for a few reasons. The GOP holds a small 21-19 majority in the state Senate, and the chamber will be up again in 2019. If Democrats can net just one district that year (or somehow take a seat before then in a special election or through a party switch), it will be up to the new lieutenant governor to break the tie and decide which party controls the chamber. This post is also a good launching pad for higher office: Aside from attorney general, Virginia doesn't have any other statewide elected offices besides governor and U.S. senator.\n\nAs we've noted before, the GOP contest is an utter shit show. To sum things up: State Sen. Bryce Reeves is accusing GOP primary rival and fellow state Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel, or at least someone close to her, of spreading false rumors insinuating that he had an affair with a campaign staffer. A third Republican, Del. Glenn Davis Jr., is running and has managed to stay out of this mess. The Democratic primary is far more sedate. The candidates are former federal prosecutor Justin Fairfax, who lost the 2013 primary for attorney general to eventual winner Mark Herring 52-48; Gene Rossi, another former federal prosecutor; and Susan Platt, who served as Joe Biden's chief of staff in the Senate in the 1990s.\n\n VA-AG: In 2013, Democrat Mark Herring won the race to become attorney general by 907 votes in a contest that wasn't resolved for over a month. Herring decided early in his term to seek re-election rather than run for governor, and he faces no opposition for renomination. On the GOP side, attorney and first-time candidate John Adams is the only contender. Adams works for a prominent Richmond law firm and he used to clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and as a lawyer in the George W. Bush White House, so it sounds like he has some connections.\n\nAdams claims that the well-funded Republican Attorneys General Association has committed to spending between $2 million and $3 million on his race, and he may not be bluffing. Virginia is the one state that will elect an attorney general this year (in New Jersey, the governor appoints the AG), so it's not like there are other contests competing for RAGA's attention right now.\n\nGrab Bag\n\n Site News: Daily Kos Elections is beyond pleased to announce that Stephen Wolf has joined our team on a full-time basis!

That means moving people around, which will ruffle feathers and create bureaucratic enemies for Mr. Kushner among those who feel he may be taking responsibility away from them and diminishing their power. All this can be done; past presidents have done so for various reasons. But I am not sure if President Trump or Mr. Kushner have yet grasped the necessity of staff for the fulfillment of his responsibilities. Without it, Mr. Kushner is just a dilettante meddling in matters he lacks the depth or the resources to grasp.\n\nx Have a preexisting condition? Go fuck yourself.

The central issue riling the developed world is the fact that our global economy has polarized into a relatively small, highly rewarded, knowledge economy and a low-skilled low wage service sector which caters to the whims of the fortunate. We can pretend all we want that if everyone got a college degree, then everyone could have access to a middle class life, but this is pure fantasy. There are simply not enough good jobs to go around and this situation is only going to become worse. Globalization has led to an international wage race to the bottom. Automation has undercut the number of workers required to do any particular task. The most common jobs in our new economy are in the low wage professions of fast-food worker, sales clerk, and cashier. To add insult to injury, all three of these most common professions, as well as many more, are likely to be taken over by robots in the not so distant future. Some researchers estimate that nearly half of our jobs are threatened by automation. Towns across middle America are already emptying out as the brightest young people flee what is increasingly an economic apocalypse. We tend to think of these crumbling towns as relics of the past when in fact, on our current path, they are harbingers of the future. In case you are reading this and thinking Im a professional  phew, that wont happen to me, well, I have news for you too. Lawyers, accountants and doctors are not safe, these jobs are all also subject to the same automation trends, albeit more slowly. Because these groups have economic and political power, through membership in the donor class, they may be able to keep the robots at bay a little longer, but the result will be the same. The machines dont just drive trucks better than we do, they read MRIs better than we do, they read litigation documents faster than we do and they find tax loopholes better than we do.

Bump/WaPo:\n\nThe web of conspiracy theorists that was ready for Donald Trump There were these weird claims the ocean floor was going to collapse and there was going to be a tsunami of oil coming ashore, Starbird said when we spoke by phone last week. It was confusing. I remember people were emotionally affected and scared about this, people that lived in the area. One woman who lived in Louisiana even sent Starbird a panicked message asking if that risk was real. It wasnt, of course. But the story was shared within that community as though it might be, including by one Twitter user central to the conversation whose main focus during the spill was using it to be critical of Barack Obama. After the 2016 election, Starbird revisited that discussion and noticed something resonant. I went back and tracked some of these articles using the Wayback Machine and they cited Russian scientists, and they went through right-wing blogs that we might call alt-right now, Starbird said, referring to the Internet Archives tool for cataloging the history of websites. At the time, I didnt notice what was going on, but with the benefit of hindsight, you notice that this stuff was happening for a long time. While Starbird didnt document any direct influence from Russian actors in her analysis, it would not have been the only instance of their behaving in that way. In his analysis of a Russian disinformation agency for the New York Times in 2015, journalist Adrian Chen documented an incident from 2014 in which Russians actively spread a news story about a disaster at a chemical plant in Louisiana, going so far as to create fake Web pages and news videos to add realism to the effort. Why? As Chen later explained, the intended effect was not to brainwash readers but to overwhelm social media with a flood of fake content, seeding doubt and paranoia, and destroying the possibility of using the Internet as a democratic space.\n\nThank you for smoking.\n\nSarah Kliff/Vox:\n\nI ran a focus group with Trump voters. Half said they support single-payer. Republican support for universal coverage is increasing We were in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, sitting in a sparse conference room at a big white table. Perry, who co-owns the research firm PerryUndem, asked the six-member group a question: Who likes Canada's health insurance system? Who wishes we had something like that? Half of the hands shot up. This surprised both of us! We hadn't planned to bring up single-payer health care; the focus group was about the Affordable Care Act. But one Trump voter had raised the idea that we'd be better off if we had a health care system like Canada's  where the government runs one health insurance plan for everyone  and wanted to see who agreed. \"There's a lot of countries that it works very successfully in,\" Michelle said of a Canadian-style single-payer system.

It wont get as much attention as a Sean Spicer press conference or a Bernie Sanders town hall, but decades from now it may prove much more important to how our economy is organized.\n\nThe University of Chicago Stigler Centers three-day conference asked, Does America Have a Concentration Problem? A sufficient response to this could be go outside. Virtually every major sector in our economy has been whittled down to a few major players. Two companies produce nearly all of Americas toothpaste. One, Luxottica, produces nearly all the sunglasses. There are four cable and Internet providers, who have divvied up the country and rarely compete. There are four major airlines. There are four major commercial banks. There are four major Internet platforms  Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google  controlling your information flow, your data, and your virtual life.\n\nThese markets are shrinking further, thanks to a continuing wave of mergers. Bayer is buying Monsanto to control a significant section of the agricultural seed market. AT&T and Time Warners combination would tie a content distributor to a content provider. The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would narrow major chain pharmacies down to two (three if youre generous and include Walmart). Platform monopolies like Google are buying a firm a week; its become a large part of their research and development strategy to acquire ideas and market share simultaneously.\n\nThis market consolidation has wide-reaching effects beyond the higher prices monopolies can charge due to lack of competition. Quality suffers when consumers have nowhere else to turn. Supply chains become fragile  an outage from Amazon Web Services, the leader in cloud computing, took out half the Internet in February. Economic power begets political power and democratic institutions suffer. Personal liberty to use talents and skills gets stymied when theres only one game in town. Barriers to entry have led to a decline in business startups and a retrenching of economic dynamism. Inequality grows when a few at the top gather all the rewards in a market.\n\nOur growing monopolization didnt happen by accident. Starting in the 1970s, a group of academics led by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork changed the view of antitrust law, which was originally intended to break up concentrated power. Without altering a word in the Sherman Antitrust Act, Bork and his colleagues  known as the Chicago school because of their devotion to University of Chicago neoclassical economic theories  rewrote history, determining that antitrust merely concerned consumer welfare, an economic study of prices, rather than effects on competition. Starting in the Reagan administration, the Chicago schools capture of antitrust theory has brought us to a period of market concentration unrivaled since the Gilded Age.\n\nA new group of scholars and activists has rebelled against Chicago school dictates. You can call them the New Brandeis movement. Louis Brandeis, before reaching the Supreme Court, advised President Woodrow Wilson in the election of 1912, condemning the curse of bigness and favoring breakups of those trusts that the Sherman Act had yet to dismantle. Under Wilson, Congress closed Sherman Act loopholes with the Clayton Antitrust Act, and created the Federal Trade Commission to combat monopoly power. As Brandeis wrote, We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cant have both.

Other than Republicans forcing through Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch by nuking the Senate filibuster rule, Trump appears poised to accomplish little-to-none of his legislative agenda. Bottom line: he has no real ideological allies on the Hill and he specializes in subtraction (or losing votes) rather than addition. The last few yeas that a popular president with an actual mandate might be able to deliver on any given bill remain out of his grasp. The Washington Post writes:\n\nHe seems both politically and personally isolated these days, said David Gergen, a former adviser to Democratic and Republican presidents dating to Richard M. Nixon. Hes flailing because he doesnt know where to find his natural allies. [...] In the West Wing, frustration abounds. For a president fixated on winning, people close to him say he is anxious to find out what went wrong with his teams health-care push and get to a deal on that issue or another front such as taxes or infrastructure as fast as possible.\n\nThe desperation is palpable. Last week, Trump was fixing for a \"fight\" with the Freedom Caucus that blew up his healthcare bill, & Dems (from the same tweet). Of course, if you go to war with both the House maniacs and Democrats, youre not passing squat. Zip. That revelation must have led to his brief flirtation with the idea of reaching out to Democrats, which he dropped just as soon as his aides floated it. Now he's back to wooing the same Republicans that killed health care like Sen. Rand Paul, whom he golfed with on Sunday.\n\nDonald Trump is desperate for traction, but he doesnt have the temperament for governing. As California Gov.

The claim, though, is a questionable one.\n\nCLF's survey, conducted by GS Strategy Group, purports to show that Ossoff's favorability has sunk like a hapless Gamorrean Guard tripping into the pit of the Sarlacc, falling from 43-26 to 38-47 in just the span of a week. The size of that drop is so immense, and the timeframe so short, that it's reasonable to be skeptical.\n\nAnd even by GS's own terms, it doesn't seem to have had any actual impact.

In a remarkable affront to local rule, Republican lawmakers passed a law in 2015 that replaced the city council districts that the city itself had drawn and replaced them with gerrymandered lines intended to hurt Democratic and black voters.\n\nDemocrats quickly brought a challenge to this new map, and the judges hearing the case have now put a stop to this usurpation of power. The court concluded that the legislatures map was an impermissible racial gerrymander; that it violated the principle of one person, one vote; and that it unfairly singled out Greensboro. The city-drawn map had remained in place for the 2015 elections while litigation was ongoing, and it will now stay in effect for elections in fall.\n\nRepublicans have gone to greater extremes to gerrymander in North Carolina than in practically any other state, and no city has been a victim of their abuses more than Greensboro, a heavily Democratic city of 300,000 that is majority non-white. Since gaining control over redistricting in 2010, Republican legislators have tried to gerrymander Greensboros districts for Congress, state legislature, county commission, county school board, and city council. There is literally no elected federal, state, or local legislative body representing Greensboro that Republican state legislators havent attempted to distort.\n\nIn fact, these gerrymanders are so effective that Greensboro, which typically votes for Democratic presidential candidates by a two-to-one ratio, is represented in the House by zero Democrats. And Guilford County, which is home to Greensboro and roughly half a million people, likewise supported Hillary Clinton by a 58-38 margin, but Republicans have maintained a majority on the county commission ever since 2012when, of course, they got to draw the map for it.\n\nCourts have, fortunately, repeatedly smacked down these efforts, invalidating GOP gerrymanders of congressional, legislative, and now council districts affecting Greensboro, as well as gerrymanders of governing bodies in other populous locales. But these persistent attacks on the principle of self-rule are par for the course for North Carolina Republicans, who have also used their legislative majoritieswhich, it must be noted, were only obtained using unconstitutional maps that have since been struck downto try to usurp the powers of Democratic Gov. Cooper after he defeated Republican Gov. Pat McCrory last year.\n\nRepublican legislators remain undeterred and continue to plot new ways to rig elections, so an appeal of this ruling is likely.

[...] By overturning the Fair Pay order, Trump made it possible for businesses with federal contracts to continue forcing sexual harassment cases like [Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson's sexual harassment suit against former Fox CEO Roger Ailes] into secret proceedings  where the public, and other employees, may never find out about rampant sex discrimination claims at a company.\n\nIt doesnt come as a big surprise that Trump would do anything that makes it harder for women to file sexual harassment or sexual assault claims in the workplace given his own history of admitted assault and harassment.

And the fall-off is not limited to Muslim travelers, but also extends to all incoming foreign tourists. Apparently, an attack on one group of tourists is regarded as an assault on all. As far as travel by distinct religious groups, flight passengers from the seven Muslim-majority nations named by Trump were down by 80% in the last week of January and first week of February, according to Forward Keys, a well-known firm of travel statisticians. On the web, flight searches for trips heading to the U.S. out of all international locations was recently down by 17%. A drop of that magnitude, if continued, would reduce the value of foreign travel within the U.S. by billions of dollars. And the number of jobs supported by foreign tourists and their expenditures in the United Statesand thus lostwould easily exceed hundreds of thousands of workers in hotels, restaurants, transportation, stores, tour operations, travel agencies, and the like.\n\nEmphasis added. Its very straightforwardthis presidents actions would be a massive job killer for an untold number of businesses, especially small businesses that rely on foreign tourism. In fact, tourism in the United States makes up 2.6 percent of the U.S. GDP and provides an eye-popping 7.6 million jobs.\n\nAnother disastrous side effect of extreme vetting is the damage to our countrys public universities. The University of California is reporting a sharp decline in applicants from foreign students:\n\nApplications from international students to the University of California have fallen for the first time in 12 years. The decline follows more than a decade in which the number of international applications rose by an average of 21 percent a year. It also coincides with the election of President Donald Trump.\n\nNationwide, universities report a drop of 40 percent and that will have a heavy impact on jobs:\n\nThe number of foreign students topped 1 million for the first time in 2016. They generated some $32 billion dollars in revenue, which supported more than 400,000 jobs, according to the Association of International Educators. Some education professionals warn a drop in international students could lead to faculty cuts, higher tuition and the loss of programs. \"I think at this point, outreach is crucial to convince students and their parents that a U.S. education is still worth the risk,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nIts clear the xenophobic actions of a president who spent nearly two years campaigning on the promise of creating jobs is going to have the opposite effect. Not to mention the brain drain created by repelling the best and brightest students around the world. In 2016, six Americans won the Nobel Prize. All six are immigrants to the United States:\n\n\"I think the resounding message that should go out all around the world is that science is global,\" Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, one of three laureates in chemistry, told The Hill on Monday. Stoddart, born in Scotland, credited American openness with bringing top scientists to the country. He added, however, that the American scientific establishment will only remain strong \"as long as we dont enter an era where we turn our back on immigration.\" Stoddart said the United States should be \"welcoming people from all over the world, including the Middle East.\"\n\nWhen you add it all up, America cannot afford the policies of the Trump administration.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/4/1650051/-Trump-admin-weighs-extreme-vetting-plan-to-force-travelers-to-give-up-social-media-passwords#read-more", "date": "2017/4/4"}, {"text": "Sen.

Coverage was really expensive and still had limited benefits and long waits.

And resulted in medical bankruptcies for people who had major medical events.\n\nThe plan would let states choose whether they wanted to keep the stricter protections of Obamacare, which means we'd see what happened with Medicaid expansion all over again. Rabid state Republican lawmakers would strip those protections away from their citizens, and the divide between red states and blue states would just deepen.

GOP Gov. Robert Bentley is termed-out of office, but for over a year, he's faced accusations that he used state resources to conceal an affair with a staffer. The GOP-dominated state legislature has been conducting a long-running, slow-moving impeachment investigation, but now, we might finally see some results.\n\nJack Sharman, who is the special counsel overseeing the probe, said last week that he planned to issue a public report to the state House Judiciary Committee on April 7, though he cautioned that his schedule is tentative. But when it arrives, if the report is sufficiently damning, it could motivate enough members of the state House to vote to impeach the governor.\n\nBizarrely, while it would only take a simple majority of the 105-member chamber to actually impeach Bentley, at least 60 percent of the House needs to vote in favor of allowing the legislature to consider impeachment. If the House can actually hit that threshold and impeach Bentley, though, the governor's powers would be transferred to Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey, a fellow Republican. If the state Senate ultimately votes to acquit Bentley, he'd resume his duties; if Bentley is convicted or resigns, Ivey would officially become governor.\n\nIvey is a potential 2018 candidate regardless of what happens to Bentley, though she isn't particularly respected in Republican circles after presiding over the collapse of the state's Prepaid Affordable College Tuition program during her tenure as state treasurer. So it's not surprising that several other Republicans are laying the groundwork to run for governor even if she's the incumbent (or de facto incumbent).\n\nLast month, Twinkle Cavanaugh, the chair of Alabama's Public Service Commission, filed paperwork to set up a committee, though she didn't formally announce she'd run (but sounds likely to). In the last few days, two more potential candidates have made similar moves. Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle formed a committee of his own, and he says he'll likely decide in late April or early May. Meanwhile, former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville recently said he'd make up his mind in the next few weeks, but he's not only also set up a campaign committee, he's loaned his nascent bid $100,000 of his own money.\n\nAs we've noted before, Tuberville might have a tough time winning over primary voters if he gets in. The football rivalry between the Auburn Tigers and the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide is legendary, but Bama fans far outnumber Auburn's. Tuberville famously enjoyed trolling Alabama when he repeatedly beat them, so he may not exactly be the best person to bridge the divide. And while Tuberville's reign was mostly a success for Auburn, he resigned in 2008 after a lousy season, including a 36-0 loss to Alabama, so even some Tigers partisans may not want him back. Tuberville, who is originally from Arkansas, has since coached in other states since he was sacked at Auburn. And while Tuberville did keep his home near his old team, he repeatedly tried to sell it, so his affection for the Yellowhammer State may be open to question.\n\nTuberville himself has an ... interesting argument for why he can win over Bama fans, though. Tuberville said that, if he hadn't repeatedly humiliated the Crimson Tide, Alabama never would have hired Nick Saban, who is now a revered figure with five national championships to his credit. We've covered a lot of political campaigns, but we don't think we've ever seen a politician make quite this type of appeal.\n\nAnd note: Alabama (the state, not the school) requires candidates to win a majority of the vote in the primary to avoid a runoff, so Tuberville can't just rally Auburn fans to score a plurality victory. He has to win outright, and that means getting a whole bunch of Bama backers to put aside old hatreds and pull the lever for him. Roll Tide!\n\n IA-Gov: Davenport Alderman Mike Matson, who has served on the city council for a decade, says that he's considering joining the race for governor, adding his name to a long list of similarly situated Democrats. Jeff Cook of the Quad-City Times notes that Matson would be the first major-party candidate in 50 years to run for governor from Scott County, which is the state's third-largest and sits on its eastern border along the Mississippi. (In case you were curious, the other three members of the Quad Cities are Bettendorf, Iowa and Rock Island and Moline, both in Illinois.)\n\nCook also mentions a very weird story from a few years ago that could hamper Matson. After a fabricated email containing confidential information that purported to come from a different alderman was sent to a local TV station, local police investigated the matter and discovered that Matson had asked the IT department at the school where he teaches to wipe his laptop clean just days later. A detective called the timing \"very suspicious\" but no charges were brought, and Matson denies wrongdoing. Still, the whole thing is really strange.\n\n MA-Gov: Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton said earlier this year that he has \"no plans\" to run against GOP Gov. Charlie Baker, and now he sounds even less likely to go for it. In a recent chat with the Boston Globe's Joshua Miller, Moulton offered kind words for Baker, whom he called a \"good man\" who is \"doing a pretty good job of leading this state.\" That's in contrast to his remarks in January, when he slammed Baker, saying the governor had \"repeatedly failed to stand up to Trump.\"\n\nMoulton says that Trump remains very much on his mind, though: He also told Miller that \"as long as Trump is in office, I'm going to stay in Washington.\" Of course, if Moulton thinks that Baker is a Trump enabler, then he could do more by knocking him out of office and using the governorship to oppose the White House than he ever could in the House.\n\n MN-Gov, MN-01: On Sunday, state Rep. Tina Liebling joined the very crowded field of Democrats looking to succeed Gov. Mark Dayton, who has said he'll retire after two terms in office.

Erin Murphy, and State Auditor Rebecca Ottoall hail from the Twin Cities region.)\n\nLiebling also said she plans to abide by the state Democratic Party's endorsement process, meaning that she'd drop out of the primary if she doesn't win the support of delegates to the party's convention. In the event she's not the lucky winner, Liebling suggested she might run for re-election to the state House, and even if she is, she might still face a primary with other Democrats who don't make the same pledge.\n\nAnd the field may yet grow further, as state House Minority Leader Paul Thissen now says he's \"seriously thinking about\" the contest and expect to make up his mind in the next two months. Meanwhile, no Republicans have yet to declare for the race, but a number are interested.\n\n NH-Gov: Former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand unexpectedly announced a second bid for governor on Monday, making him the first Democrat to challenge Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who just won office last fall. But Sununu, who has already helped shepherd a typically radical Republican agenda into law, will quickly have to return to a campaign footing, since New Hampshire only elects its governors to two-year terms.\n\nMarchand's getting a much earlier start this time: Last time out, he only entered the race in March of 2016. As a result, he was never able to overtake Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern, the establishment favorite, who crushed him by a 51-25 margin in the Democratic primary. Van Ostern went on to lose to Sununu by a very tight 49-47 spread, so Democrats are now gearing up to try again.\n\nWill Marchand be the guy, though? Until last year, he was state director of the group No Labels, which is basically reverse catnip for progressives. Amazingly, No Labels gave Donald Trump an award during the presidential campaign! In this era, that's not going to play well at all, and Marchand will have some 'splainin' to do, since he's unlikely to have the primary to himself.\n\n NJ-Gov: Former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy is almost the very definition of an establishment candidate in a state that almost always rewards them. Over the weekend, Murphy announced that he'd won the endorsement of all 21 of New Jersey's county-level Democratic parties, meaning his name will appear first on the ballot in the June 6 primary in every corner of the state. Murphy's personal wealth certainly helped: Over the last decade-and-a-half, he's donated over $1 million to local Democratic organizations.\n\nHe has also secured support from countless elected officials; has put at least $10 million of his own money into his campaign; and has led in all polls, both of the primary and the general. Meanwhile, his intra-party rivals have failed to gain much traction. Perhaps the one guy showing some pep in his step, though, is former U.S. Treasury official Jim Johnson, who just released his second TV ad of the race. Johnson tries to cram in a ton of different issues (universal pre-K, prescription drug costs, and property taxes), but his main message is that \"[l]eaders should stand for the people, not the political machine,\" noting that he's qualified for public matching fundsan unusual thing to bring up in an adto help fight \"the flood of money in politics.\"\n\nThere's no word on the size of Johnson's buy, but he's definitely going to get outspent by Murphy, since candidates who accept public funds are limited to spending $6.4 million on the primary. State Sen. Ray Lesniak and state Assemblyman John Wisniewski are also both running, but, like Johnson, they're in the low single digits in the polls. On the GOP side, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno is the nominal frontrunner in the race to succeed her boss, the wildly unpopular (and term-limited) Chris Christie.\n\n OK-Gov: Republican state Auditor Gary Jones, who recently said he's considering a bid for governor, now says he expects to decide \"by summer.\" Jones is conducting something of an anti-audition for the job, saying that \"I'm not enamored with the idea of being governor\" and declaring that \"I'll have significantly less money than anybody.\" So far, though, zero candidates have declared for the race to succeed termed-out Gov. Mary Fallin, so Jones has as much money as anyone who is actually running.\n\n PA-Gov: A consultant for Republican state House Speaker Mike Turzai, who previously had not ruled out a run for governor, now makes it sound like his client is indeed interested in a bid. Strategist Mark Harris says that Turzai \"may explore a run more seriously after the state budget is finished\" (in the word of WITF reporter Katie Meyer), but Harris quickly went on to tout Turzai's supposed advantages, so it sounds like he's already explored the idea quite a bit.\n\nIf Turzai's name rings a bell, it's probably because back in 2012, he gave up the GOP game on voter ID laws, admitting its purpose was to help Republican candidates. Pointing to his alleged \"achievements\" in office, Turzai said the quiet part loud, declaring, \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.\" Right now, wealthy state Sen. Scott Wagner has the field to himself, but a lot of other Republicans are also considering bids against Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.\n\n SD-Gov, SD-AL: Republican Lt. Gov. Matt Michels, who'd been considering a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Dennis Daugaard, has decided against trying to succeed his current boss. He also said he wouldn't seek the House seat that's being left open by Rep. Kristi Noem, a fellow Republican who herself is running for governor. State Attorney General Marty Jackley is also seeking the GOP's gubernatorial nod, while two candidates are running for Noem's seat.\n\n VA-Gov: The Virginia Education Association, a teachers union with over 50,000 members, has endorsed Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam in the June 13 Democratic primary for governor. Northam faces ex-Rep. Tom Perriello for the nomination, a race that public polls have shown is tight.\n\n WI-Gov: Tech executive Mark Bakken is the latest Democrat to apparently shy away from challenging Republican Gov. Scott Walker: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that Bakken made calls to \"close associates\" on Friday, telling them he wouldn't run, according to unnamed people who spoke directly with him. Bakken himself wouldn't comment, which is a little strange (why not just be candid about your lack of interest?), but presumably if he were still holding the door open, he'd have taken the chance to correct the record.\n\nIn any event, Bakken's move might actually clear a path for a friend of his, state Rep. Dana Wachs, who was reportedly unlikely to run if Bakken had done so. Indeed, Wachs, who is also a trial attorney and might have some personal wealth, said he was disappointed to hear the news, though he now says on the record that he'll consider a bid.\n\nBut just last week, former state Sen. Tim Cullen pulled the plug on an expected bid, while former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Mark Tauscher didn't succumb to an online effort to draft him as a candidate, saying he \"will not be entering the 2018 race for governor.\" Still, apart from Wachs, there are several other Democrats contemplating the contest, including businessman Andy Gronik and Dane County Executive Joe Parisi.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-34: Arturo Carmona's campaign in the special election for California's dark-blue 34th Congressional District already looked like it was going nowhere, and now things are even grimmer. Late last week, a former colleague from Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, Masha Mendieta, accused Carmona of sexism and mismanagement in his capacity as Sanders' deputy political director last year. That prompted former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, one of the most prominent Sanders supporters in the nation, to call on National Nurses United to pull its endorsement of Carmona. (The union responded by saying it's \"100%\" for Carmona.)\n\nFlores, it must be noted, is also backing another candidate, labor activist Wendy Carrillo, who has also tried to claim the Berniecrat mantle. It's very possible that Carmona's candidacy never took off because of this split in Sandersville, so perhaps Carrillo now has an opening. However, time's just about up. Carillo is fighting against at least three or four other mid-major candidates for what they all hope is a second slot in a June 6 runoff. The frontrunner, however, has long appeared to be Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, and if he can clear 50 percent in Tuesday's primary, there won't be a second round.\n\n CA-45: UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter became the first Democrat to announce a campaign against Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. Porter appears to be well-regarded in legal circles as a consumer-protection advocate who worked under now-Sen. Kamala Harris when Harris was state attorney general to monitor a multi-billion dollar settlement agreement with banks over mortgages in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Both Harris and national star Sen. Elizabeth Warren have already given Porter their backing, which indicates that the first-time candidate could have major connections to raise the money needed for a tough race.\n\nThe Orange County-based 45th District swung hard to voting for Hillary Clinton 50-44 after having favored Mitt Romney 55-43 in 2012, largely thanks to its extremely high share of college-educated voters. Unsurprisingly, Porter immediately sought to tie Walters to Trump, slamming her for voting with him on every major issue. While Walters easily won a second term against an unheralded Democratic foe last year, Team Blue will likely need to be winning districts such as this one if they're going to gain the 24 seats needed for a House majority in 2018, and it's quite possible that more Democrats will express interest in running here.\n\n CO-05: Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn has long struggled to consolidate support within his own party ever since he first won the nomination for this Colorado Springs-area district with just a 27 percent plurality in a divisive 2006 primary. It appears he'll have another major intraparty fight in 2018 after state Sen. Owen Hill announced that he would run. Lamborn barely survived the 2014 primary by 53-47, and his 58-35 convention loss to a relatively unknown challenger nearly precluded him from the ballot entirely in 2016, although he later won that year's primary. Unfortunately for Democrats, even if this seat becomes open or if Lamborn emerges damaged from a 2018 primary, Trump's 57-33 victory here would make it very tough for them to flip this district.\n\n FL-07: Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy narrowly won in one of 2016's major upsets after longtime incumbent GOP Rep. John Mica proved to be a rusty campaigner against the first-time candidate, and Republicans have been eager to make this suburban Orlando-area district one of their top targets in 2018. Term-limited Republican state Sen. David Simmons had previously sounded reluctant to enter the race, but now says that he's \"98 percent headed towards a run\" after meeting with the NRCC.\n\nSimmons' legislative district covers roughly three-fifths of the 7th District, making him a top-tier recruit for Republicans. Simmons is also wealthy, with a reported net worth of $11.5 million as of 2015, so he can do some self-funding if he wants to. While Hillary Clinton won the 7th by 51-44, Obama only carried it by a handful of votes in 2012, meaning Murphy could be in for another very tough race.\n\n FL-27: Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's 55-45 victory in 2016 was her narrowest edge since she initially won her House seat in 1989, despite her Democratic opponent Scott Fuhrman having little support from national Democrats. That surprisingly narrow margin for the longtime incumbent was undoubtedly a consequence of this heavily Cuban-American Miami district swinging from 53-47 Obama in 2012 all the way to 59-39 Clinton in 2016, making the 27th Clinton's best district that Republicans hold.\n\nFuhrman announced on Monday that he would take another shot at Ros-Lehtinen in 2018, but there's a good chance he isn't the first or even second choice of national Democrats. While the businessman self-funded substantially to spend roughly $900,000 for his 2016 race, he faced harsh attacks over his history of being arrested four times, the most recent and serious of which was in 2009 for driving under the influence with a loaded handgun in his vehicle. To his credit, Fuhrman acknowledged and apologized for his past right off the bat when he launched his 2016 campaign, but that doesn't mean voters will be so forgiving.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, the DCCC met with Fuhrman in March, but they also talked with Miami Beach Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, whom the Herald reports is planning to run. Regardless of whom Democrats nominate, this seat could simply be too important of an opportunity to pass up. Ros-Lehtinen has worked hard to distance herself from Trump and Cuban-American voters were quite willing to split their tickets in 2016, but his unpopularity here might end up being too much for her to overcome next year.\n\n KS-02: Republican state Sen. Steve Fitzgerald became the first Republican to officially enter the race to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Lynn Jenkins in 2018. Fitzgerald has a record as a conservative firebrand, calling Planned Parenthood \"much worse\" than a Nazi concentration camp in March, while he previously likened anti-abortion efforts to the abolition of slavery. The 2nd District covers Topeka and eastern Kansas outside of the Kansas City area, and it favored Donald Trump by a wide 56-37 spread, but Democrats are hoping that the GOP's recent struggles at the state level could help give them an opening in 2018.\n\nIndeed, Fitzgerald himself has a history of underperforming the Republican presidential nominee. Mitt Romney won his state Senate district by 53-45 in 2012 and Trump likely did so by an even wider margin in 2016, but Fitzgerald only prevailed 51-49 over his Democratic foe as Kansas voters took out their rage against Gov. Sam Brownback's hard-right faction of the state GOP on legislators last year. Tying the eventual nominee to Brownback's disastrously unpopular tenure might be the only shot Democrats have at victory here, but it's likely that Fitzgerald will have company in the Republican primary. However, so far no other big names have publicly expressed interest in running.\n\n OH-01, OH-Gov: State Rep. Alicia Reece is considered a rising star within the Ohio Democratic Party, and the former Cincinnati vice mayor tells Cincinnati.com that she's trying to figure out her next move after she runs into term limits in 2018. High-level House Democrats like Rep. Elijah Cummings are reportedly trying to recruit Reece to challenge 1st District Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, and she will supposedly meet with them in D.C. about a bid in April. Reece is reportedly considering other offices like governor, but she could have a tougher time breaking through in a potentially crowded field for statewide office.\n\nChabot easily defeated an underfunded Democratic opponent in 2016, and beating him in this heavily gerrymandered Cincinnati seat won't be easy, since Trump won it by 51-45. However, the 1st was still the bluest of the 12 districts that Republicans hold in Ohio, and unlike most seats in the state, it didn't trend sharply Republican in 2016. If Reece does decide to run, she could give Democrats a real shot at pulling off an upset next year.\n\n OH-16: On Monday, state Rep. Christina Hagan became the first prominent Republican to announce a campaign for the House in the 16th District after GOP Rep. Jim Renacci announced he would run for governor in 2018 instead of re-election. Hagan was a staunch Trump supporter in 2016 even as many Ohio Republicans like Gov. John Kasich refused to vigorously support him. That could help the ardent conservative in the primary now that Trump has ingratiated himself with the Republican base. Hagan would be just 29-years-old by the general election, which would make her the youngest woman to ever get elected to Congress if she prevails next year.\n\nHowever, Hagan can likely expect primary opposition in this greater Cleveland-area seat, which supported Trump by a 56-39 spread. State Sen. Tom Patton, a longtime Republican legislator, recently confirmed to Cleveland.com via a spokesperson that he was indeed looking at running for House. Meanwhile, Cuyahoga County Republican Party Chair Rob Frost reportedly took himself out of the running. Frost had previously been mentioned as a possible contender for House, but had also spoken well of Patton. Finally, state Sen. Frank LaRose was previously reportedly considering a campaign, while several other names have been mentioned as possible Republican candidates.\n\n TX-16: Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke's recent entry into the 2018 Senate race means next year will also feature an open seat for his El Paso-based House district. Hillary Clinton won this heavily Latino seat by 68-27, meaning it's almost certain to remain in Democratic hands, and Team Blue has a deep bench of candidates who could run.\n\nEl Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar, whose office also functions as both a county executive and legislator, told the Texas Tribune that she is \"seriously considering\" a bid, but Texas law would likely force her to resign her post to run. However, Escobar reportedly has a poor relationship with the local party, although she does appear to be an ally of O'Rourke, who himself was a political outsider when he defeated then-Rep. Silvestre Reyes in the 2012 primary.\n\nState Rep. Csar Blanco previously stated that he was considering the race if O'Rourke vacated the seat, but he declined to reveal his latest plans on Monday, saying \"political statements will have to wait\" while the legislative session is ongoing. El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser had also previously said he would be interested in a campaign if O'Rourke didn't run again, but he apparently ruled out running in February. However, Leeser isn't running for re-election as mayor in 2017, so he might reconsider now that the House seat is actually open.\n\nNathan Gonzales of Inside Elections put on his Great Mentioner cap shortly before O'Rourke's announcement and said that Blanco and Escobar were seen as the most likely candidates, but there will almost certainly be many more names who could potentially run.\n\nMayoral\n\n Bolingbrook, IL Mayor: The village of Bolingbrook in suburban Chicago is small, home to just 73,000 people, but Tuesday's mayoral election has captured an outsize share of attention. That's because the longtime incumbent, Roger Claar, revealed himself as a vocal Trump supporter last year, even though his town voted 66 percent for Hillary Clinton. Claar sparked particular anger among constituents when he announced plans to hold a fundraiser for the Republican nominee in September, and when he refused to back down, he inspired Will County Board member Jackie Traynere to run against him.\n\nWhile the race is officially nonpartisan, progressives have rallied around Traynere, a former union organizer, and they've succeeded in earning some national press, with features in both the Washington Post and the New York Times. Traynere's also been backed by some major players in Illinois politics, including Sen. Dick Durbin, who sent out a fundraising request on her behalf.\n\nBut Claar's been in office for 31 years and has lots of fans, thanks in part to his efforts over the years to bring development to the town. That yields an interesting matchup between a classic machine pol who may have overstayed his welcome and amped-up progressives who justly don't want to be governed by a Trump backer. However, while everyone is looking for the perfect \"test\" of anti-Trump energies, there are some decidedly local issues at stake here (like garbage collectionBolingbrook refuses to use trash cans!), so as always, be careful what you read into small, one-off elections like these.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/4/1649948/-Morning-Digest-GOP-touts-poll-showing-Ossoff-fading-but-their-ad-spending-says-otherwise#read-more", "date": "2017/4/4"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Tuesday, April 4, 2017\n\nNote: A quick scheduling and \"fuck my cancer\" update.

Yesterday Senate Republicans in the Judiciary committee stamped \"Grade-A Prime Federalist Society-approved Corporation-loving Judicial Activist\" on Neil Gorsuch's tush and sent him on his merry way. Now he goes to the full Senate, where Democrats---say Hallelujah!!!---have the votes to filibuster his ass. When they do, Mitch McConnell will have a big decision on his hands: whether or not to go nuclear, securing Trump's too-smug-by-half nominee a seat with only 51 votes, but also green-lighting future democratic presidents to nominate the likes of Michael Moore, Khizr Khan, Hillary Clinton, and Solarpanel McSinglepayer. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, but for now I just want to say: congrats, Senate Dems---after rooting around the attic for so many years, you found your spine.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee 49 years ago today at the age of 39, less than a day after delivering his famous \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech at the Mason Temple in which he made it clear he knew he was in the cross-hairs:\n\nI got into Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? President Obama at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial on Oct. 14, 2011. Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! And so I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man.\n\nOur favorite Kingjuniorism resonates louder with every passing year, given the ongoing radicalization of the Republican party: \"Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.\" His lips to their ears.\n\nCHEERS and JEERS to making cents (and also losing a few). Being a world-renowned fauxconomist, I know how easy it is for my giant brain-thumb to tip various fiduciary scales around the world. So I'll simply stay neutral and offer this handy summary of the current climate in the business world with some traditional-media headlines. Caution---might be some minor whiplash ahead:\n\n> Wheat crop to be lowest on record as farmers plant soybeans > Consumer spending up tiny 0.1 percent in February > Tech jobs thriving > Judge approves $25 million settlement over Trump University > McDonalds switching to fresh beef over frozen in Quarter Pounders Oh...did we mention its Free Cone Day at Ben & Jerrys? > Republicans gutting internet privacy is just the beginning. Up next on the GOP agenda: scrapping net neutrality > Economists not optimistic about coal comeback > Tesla posts record 25,000 vehicle deliveries > Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler sales underwhelming > Construction spending rises to 11-year high > Maine jobless rate falls to 3.2% > Legal pot sales up 34% in 2016\n\nAnd this just in: through the miracle of online commerce, for a mere 11 bucks you can learn how to make a solid-chocolate Baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy II for all your friends, family, and blogging buds. Nothing personal, Cadbury Bunny...just business.\n\nCHEERS to the red white and blue. On April 4, 1818, Congress finally got off its duff and officially proclaimed that the U.S. flag would have thirteen red and white stripes to honor the minty freedom freshness of candy canes, and one star for each star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They also decreed that any politician who fails to wear a five-pound American-flag lapel pin 24/7 will thus and forevermore be branded \"a filthy tyrant wretch in dire need of a caning.\" In other words, they got more done in a day than the Republican House leadership has in seven years.\n\nCHEERS to the \"Betsy Ross of the LGBT community.\" When I came out of the closet a quarter century ago, the pink triangle was still sporadically being used as a symbol of gay rights. Fortunately its days were numbered because nobody really liked using the Nazi-era design---the gay equivalent of the yellow star Jews were forced to wear in the 30s and 40s---to represent gay pride. Fortunately, Gilbert Baker came along in 1978 and, in a lightning strike of inspiration, hand-sewed the first rainbow flag that he got to see become ubiquitous around the world (including a post-Supreme Court marriage decision rainbow light-up of the White House). Sad to report that Baker has died at a much-too-young 65. Here's a fascinating glimpse into how his flag came to be:\n\nIn the ultimate act of generosity, Baker never trademarked his rainbow flag. He wanted it to be \"my gift to the world.\" Long may it wave.\n\nJEERS to the long and short of it. After he was sworn in, 68 year-old William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural speech of any president: 105 minutes. Here are some of the highlights:\n\n9 minute mark \"Okay, lets break the ice with a little game of Duck Duck Goose. Vice President Tyler, why dont you go first.\" 30 minute mark So the guy looks at him and says: The Aristocrats! Ha ha ha, great joke! But seriously... True fact: Harrison spent 17 minutes of his inaugural address in a staredown contest with the crowd. He won. 36 minute mark \"I was thinkin the other day: I wonder if well ever have a president whos, like, a total douchebag cuz hes filthy rich but also really stupid and wrecks everything cuz he thinks hes such a bigly dictator. Naaaaaah!!! So, anyway, back to my story about the frog and the loaded musket... 42 minute mark \"Hey, can somebody give me a signal at the 104-minute mark so Ill know to wrap it up? Thanks.\" 62 minute mark \"Aaaaaahhhh-CHOO!!!! I know, I know...say it don't spray it, ha ha habut anyway---[sniffle]---now there are 44 bottles of beer on the wall. Yes, 44 bottles of beer. Then you take one down and pass it around...\" 93 minute mark: \"[Sigh] Can we just all be really still for a few minutes and just, like, be? Lets combine our auras and justfeel the love...\"\n\nThe day was unusually cold and windy, and he delivered his address in nothing more than a pair of boxers and a swath of leopard skin draped over his shoulder. Bad move. 31 days later, on April 4, 1841, Harrison became the first president to die in office of either pneumonia or his doctors' treatment of his pneumonia. Pay your respects here. Try and keep it brief.\n\n-\n\nTen years ago in C&J: April 4, 2007\n\nCHEERS to the light at the end of the tunnel. Word from NBC's Andrea Mitchell that we're roughly five months from the collapse of GOP support for Bush's war.

Martin Luther King Jr.s speech to Clergy and Laity Concerned About VietnamBeyond Vietnam: A Time to Break the Silencedelivered 50 years ago, April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York. In it, he warned against the deadly triplets of racism, militarism, and materialism:\n\n[...] The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality [applause], and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing clergy and laymen concerned committees for the next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru. They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy. [sustained applause] So such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God.\n\nIn 1957 a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. During the past ten years we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S. military advisors in Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counterrevolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru.\n\nIt is with such activity that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable. [applause] Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments. I am convinced that if we are to get on to the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin [applause], we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.\n\nA true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand we are called to play the Good Samaritan on lifes roadside, but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on lifes highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see than an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. [applause]\n\nA true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, This is not just. It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, This is not just. The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.\n\nA true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, This way of settling differences is not just. This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nations homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. [sustained applause]\n\nAmerica, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war. There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.\n\nThis kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism. [applause] War is not the answer. Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not join those who shout war and, through their misguided passions, urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations. These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness. We must not engage in a negative anticommunism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy [applause], realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice. We must with positive action seek to remove those conditions of poverty, insecurity, and injustice, which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops.\n\nThese are revolutionary times. All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression, and out of the wounds of a frail world, new systems of justice and equality are being born. The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before. The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. We in the West must support these revolutions.\n\nIt is a sad fact that because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions that we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism. With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores, and thereby speed the day when every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low [Audience:] (Yes); the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.\n\nA genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.

Like financial security.\n\nBudget reconciliation was the fire-proof way Republicans were going to repeal Obamacare and enact Trumpcare without facing a potential filibuster in the Senate. But there was that little problem about them having no idea and even less interest in how to do anything with health care, so it failed. Massively. But they do know how to put Wall Street back in control, so that's their latest plan for budget reconciliation. Swap out Obamacare for the Dodd-Frank financial reform, and we'll all be back where we were in 2008 and banks will once again have the power to destroy the global economy.\n\nAll indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about repealing and replacing these regulations  most of which were passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers. Theyve made banks more resilient and created stability in the capital markets. Expect Republicans, as in the case of the health care bill, to attack the regulations by way of the budget: specifically, through the budget reconciliation process that eliminates the threat of a Democratic filibuster. [] Dodd-Frank can be weakened through neglect, and the regulators President Trump puts into place are certainly likely to try that strategy. But the main danger is funding. Paul Ryan's goal in the next two years is to recreate the federal government using a narrow majority and Senate budget rules to dodge the filibuster. This approach is dangerous when it comes to financial reform, because instead of creating a system that works for the overall economy, the proposals may well amount to a smash-and-grab of whatever fits this procedural trick. Rapid change is the strength of this approach, but it would be rapid change in a direction that hurts consumersand it makes a repeat of the 2007 to 2008 financial meltdown more likely.\n\nThere are a lot of targets within the law Republicans want to take down, starting with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because those four words in combination apparently give them hives. Apparently if you're going to have a financial life, Republicans believe, you deserve to be screwed by banks, credit card companies, car dealersreally anyone who might take your money. The next four words they hate are Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which monitors the financial system for \"financial firms that pose an unusually high risk of collapse, panic, and uncertainty to the economy,\" and imposes tougher regulations for them. That obviously has to be defunded, because collapse, panic, and uncertainty is where they can really make some money. Too big to fail? Not if you're a Republican. They're likely to try to defund and and take away the emergency powers the FDIC has to deal with failing financial institutions. If a huge institutionlike Lehmanis failing they don't believe there should be intervention prevent it. They think it's no big deal.

First, the campaign took a stab, then the transition team, and now Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is spearheading yet another effort that the White House plans to shepherd through Congress under Donald Trump's steady leadership. But the new effort has some Trump allies a little worried, writes Politico.\n\nThere's no reason for Treasury to rewrite the tax plan, said Stephen Moore, a senior economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation who helped draft the Trump campaigns tax plan. Trump already has a great tax plan he ran on in the campaign. That plan slashed tax rates for individuals and corporations to the tune of trillions of dollars.\n\nMoore's apparently shocked, just shocked that Trump's gone hot and cold on a policy proposalgee, he just seemed so rock solid on the campaign trail.

The trouble is that that proposal generates much of the revenue in Ryans plan, one potential blueprint from which the administration could work. Without it, one Hill staffer in favor of the plan said, the offsets become a lot more ugly.\n\nIn other words, if the White House scraps Ryan's border adjustment tax (BAT) which would bring in an estimated $1 trillion in revenue, it becomes nearly impossible to cut taxes without adding to the deficit/debt (unless Steve Bannon figures out a way to simply dissolve the federal government). Failure to put forth a revenue-neutral tax package would ultimately force Republicans to sunset their tax cuts after ten years or less instead of being able to make them permanent. It's essentially the difference between true tax reformwhich would permanently overhaul the tax/revenue schemeversus simply cutting taxes for a finite period of time.\n\nNeedless to say, Ryan and House Republicans aren't super excited about surrendering control of tax reform to the White House, which also isn't super keen on watching the House GOP crater Trump's next legislative effort.

He either forgot to sign them or simply found the process of governing so tedious that he bolted. Both scenarios hold greater meaning for Trump's floundering presidency. But where trade is concerned, corporations are starting to call Trumps bluff, writes Paul Krugman:\n\nBusiness seems to have decided that Mr. Trump is a paper tiger on trade: The flow of corporate relocations to Mexico, which slowed briefly while C.E.O.s tried to curry favor with the new president, has resumed. Trade policy by tweet, it appears, has run its course. Investors seem to have reached the same conclusion: The Mexican peso plunged 16 percent after the election, but since Inauguration Day it has recovered almost all the lost ground.\n\nThe administration has also been circulating a letter on Capitol Hill detailing new demands on NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) that, far from decimating the deal, was considered relatively benign. Not exactly the sea change candidate Trump called for on what he declared the worst trade deal ever.\n\nSo why has Trump backed off all that tough trade talk? Remember his revelation on health care reform a couple months ago: Nobody knew it could be so complicated. Trump's really been in for some surprises on trade too.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/3/1649858/-Trump-s-tough-trade-talk-on-NAFTA-turns-to-a-whimper#read-more", "date": "2017/4/3"}, {"text": "And now the Trump-Russia connections include notorious Blackwater founder Erik Prince.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials.

The intelligence community isn't messing around with surveillance of American citizens, they're surveilling suspicious foreign agents and people closely connected to Donald Trump keep freaking popping up in those conversations, over and over, whether it be in Trump Tower or in the Seychelles.

When Graham brought up his intention to approve Gorsuch, audience members began shouting \"Merrick Garland!\" Graham argued that Democrats protesting Gorsuch by referring to Garland \"is like an arsonist complaining about a fire.\" He insisted that Republicans were correct to block Garlands nomination because it came during an election year, and accused opponents of Gorsuch of \"being blinded by your own partisanship.\" [] \"If I have to, I will vote to change the rules because I am not going to allow President Trump to be denied the same opportunity that every president has had for 200 years because youre mad, and you cant accept the outcome of an election,\" he said, to boos from the audience.\n\nUh-huh. That one's not going to work on your constituents, Lindsey, or anyone who has been paying attention to the last eight years of Republican obstruction. Nor are they going to forget Graham's promise from just a few months ago that he would oppose any effort to end the filibuster. In November, he said going nuclear was \"a horrible, terrible idea.\" He also said that if the nuclear option came to the floor he would oppose it \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\nAt some point, this level of blatant hypocrisy that Republicans have skated on is finally going to be their downfall. With Trump in the driver's seat, that's going to be happening sooner rather than later. They really need to think twice about blowing up the Supreme Court for this president.\n\nReady to take action?

Jon Tester (D-MT)\n\nMontana Democrat Jon Tester announced Sunday that he will both oppose Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court and join fellow Democrats in filibustering. It's a strong, principled statement that would work for any Democrat running in a red or purple state in 2018. Which is precisely what Tester is doing. He's not going to be afraid to explain his principled stand to constituents.\n\n\"Judge Gorsuch is a smart man but that doesn't make him right for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Tester said in written remarks released Sunday evening. \"I cannot support a nominee who refuses to answer important questions. \"With Judge Gorsuch on the bench, I am deeply concerned that dark money will continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens, the court will stand between women and their doctors, and the government will reach into the private lives of law-abiding Americans,\" he stated. \"These are not Montana values, which is why I cannot support this nomination.\" [] Tester said he met with Gorsuch \"face-to-face, giving him a fair hearing, and reviewing his qualifications.\" \"With Judge Gorsuch on the bench, I am deeply concerned that dark money will continue to drown out the voices and votes of citizens, the court will stand between women and their doctors, and the government will reach into the private lives of law-abiding Americans,\" Tester wrote.\n\nThose are more than valid concerns about Gorsuch, an astoundingly opaque nominee who refused to answer the most basic of questions and who did come into the process with millions in dark money being spent on his behalf. Tester is doing his job, without regard for what Republicans might decide to dogo nuclear and get rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees or not. As it should be.\n\nWhich should have occurred to Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who has decided to give Gorsuch his vote. \"After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers,\" Donnelly says. That makes three Democrats, including Heidi Heitkamp (ND) and Joe Manchin (WV) who will vote with Republicans. But it also makes 36 Democrats who will filibuster, so far.

He also says that \"I'm only going to do this if we can win,\" yet at the same time, when asked how he can beat Cruz, he admits, \"Tactically, strategically, I don't know.\" Those are rather contradictory thoughts.\n\nOther details don't help matters, either. From O'Rourke's own telling, it appears that he didn't even inform his wife before he publicly began mooting a Senate bid, and she's not the only person in the dark: Few people in Texas politics know O'Rourke. As Livingston memorably puts it, O'Rourke's hometown of El Paso is \"so remote it is in a separate time zone from the rest of the state. It is a shorter drive from his district to San Diego than to Beaumont,\" near the border with Louisiana.\n\nPainfully, even many of those Democrats who have heard of him don't know how to pronounce his name properly, calling him \"Bee-to\" (it's closer to \"Betto\"). And even the DSCC didn't mention O'Rourke in their Friday newsletter, even though it was published after his formal kickoff.\n\nThere's also the matter of Rep. Joaquin Castro, a fellow Democrat who, like O'Rourke, was also elected to the House in 2012. Castro has also been considering a run for Senate, and as word of O'Rourke's pending announcement circulated, Castro reiterated that he's still thinking about the race. A competitive statewide Democratic primary in Texas would certainly be interesting, but it would make the already daunting quest for rivers of cash even more intimidating.\n\nStill, whatever O'Rourke's chances may be, Democrats are fortunate to have someone in place who could take advantage of a total Republican implosion, should such a scenario unfold. And who knows? If Democrats can run the table and somehow defend all of their incumbents while picking up GOP-held seats in Nevada and Arizona, O'Rourke would give them that desperately needed shot at a third pickup to take back the Senate. It's a triple bank-shot, but every once in a rare while, you actually sink one of those.\n\nO'Rourke's decision also opens up his safely blue seat in the 16th Congressional District. We'll take a look at the potential field there in the next Digest.\n\nSenate\n\n NV-Sen: Rep. Dina Titus is so far the only big-name Democrat to openly consider challenging Republican Sen. Dean Heller in 2018, and according to the Las Vegas Sun, Titus said she will decide in the next few months. Although both state Senate Majority Leader Aaron Ford and wealthy businessman Stephen Cloobeck have been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates, Titus thought it was unlikely that either of them would run for Senate or governor next year. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson recently refused to rule out a Senate campaign, but few other Democrats have been willing to go on the record about running.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n AL-Gov: We can add two more names to the list of Republicans who could reach a decision soon about whether to run for governor of this dark-red state in 2018. Former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville says he has been on a \"listening tour\" around the state as he considers running and that he could reach a decision in the \"next couple of weeks.\" Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle had reportedly been mulling a run, and he confirmed that interest by telling AL.com that he foresaw arriving at a decision by the end of April.\n\nNo Republicans have formally announced a campaign to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Robert Bentley, who himself might still face impeachment over a scandal, but several other Republicans are thinking about it. That includes Public Service Commission President Twinkle Cavanaugh, state Auditor Jim Zeigler, state Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, and Jefferson County Commissioner David Carrington. Additionally, twice-disgraced former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore and Rep. Bradley Byrne haven't ruled it out.\n\n CA-Gov: A new YouGov poll from UC Berkeley finds Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, leading the pack in next year's top-two gubernatorial primary with 28 percent of the vote, while Republican businessman John Cox is in second with 18 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state Treasurer John Chiang, also both Democrats, take 11 and 8 percent respectively. A third of voters are still undecided, and there's a lot of game left to be played (and money to be spent playing it). In particular, there's still a decent chance that the general election could once again wind up being a Democrat-vs.-Democrat affair, just as 2016s open-seat race to succeed Sen. Barbara Boxer was.\n\n GA-Gov: Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp became the first major candidate for either party to formally announce a run for governor in 2018 to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Nathan Deal. Kemp has been in office since 2010 and has been on the front lines of trying to suppress votes as Georgia's chief elections administrator. Kemp recently settled a voting rights lawsuit in February that alleged he wrongfully blocked the voter registrations of over 40,000 predominantly African-American voters.\n\nKemp almost certainly won't have Team Red's primary to himself. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle is reportedly a likely candidate, while state Sen. Josh McKoon and former Rep. Lynn Westmoreland have previously said they're considering too. There are also several other legislators and Republican officials who are reportedly interested in a bid.\n\n IL-Gov, IL-13: State Sen. Andy Manar, who had been weighing a run for governor, announced on Friday that he would not join the race. While Manar was busy thinking about whether or not to challenge Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, though, the Democratic field quickly grew very crowded and now includes several notable names, a couple of whom are exceedingly wealthy. Manar did still have an advantage in that he represents a district in downstate Illinois, whereas almost all of the other credible contenders hail from Chicago, but evidently he decided that a gubernatorial bid wasn't worth it.\n\nBut could he still seek a different sort of promotion? In early March, Manar didn't rule out a bid against GOP Rep. Rodney Davis in the 13th Congressional District, and he'd be a very strong recruit for Team Blue. It's not clear whether this option is still on the table, though. While Manar explicitly closed the door on the gubernatorial race, the statement he issued didn't touch on a possible congressional run, so here's hoping.\n\n NM-Gov: On Friday, Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the endorsement of former longtime Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman, who served from 1983 to 2013. Lujan Grisham jumped into the race early to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, and she continues to consolidate high-profile support ahead of 2018's primary. However, fellow Democratic state Sen. Joseph Cervantes is also in the race, while state Attorney General Hector Balderas, Santa Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales, former Univision executive Jeff Apodaca, and businessman Alan Webber are all considering running for Team Blue.\n\nHouse\n\n GA-06: Yep, it turns out that Republicans really are afraid that Jon Ossoff could win the April 18 special election primary without a runoff. On Thursday, a couple of articles surfaced (one from Politico, the other from CNN) citing GOP fears that Ossoff might deliver a first-round knockout, but the skeptical side of us wondered if Republicans were just trying to juke the expectations game in the hopes of deflating progressive enthusiasm in the event Ossoff isn't able to clear 50 percent (which is still the most likely outcome).\n\nBut we were giving them too much credit, because on Friday, Republicans proved how nervous they are by actually spending money on new ads designed to forestall what has become their ultimate nightmare scenario. Both of the spots are pretty weird, though, each in their own way.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, which has spent over $2 million attacking Ossoff, has decided that he's no longer an unready frat house Han Solo but rather the would-be leader of a revolutionary movement ready to burn the country to the ground. Indeed, their ad features footage of anarchist dipshits trashing Washington, DC ahead of the inauguration while scary music plays and an anxious narrator declares, \"Jon Ossoff is one of them. Ossoff will vote with Nancy Pelosi for more spending, bigger government, and a weaker military.\" But will the highly educated, Republican-leaning but anti-Trump voters in this district that Ossoff is relying on to put him over the top really cotton to this sort of hysterical message?\n\nMeanwhile, the NRCC is in an even deeper fix. Because they've been leery of taking sides in the primary, they're reduced to begging people to come out and literally \"vote Republican for Congress\"any Republican! doesn't matter!to keep Ossoff under 50. Not that their ad mentions Ossoff, but they do claim Democrats \"are trying to stop our Republican majority that's getting things done.\" Hoo boy is that a tough sell. What's more, the spot features footage of Trump gesticulating madly. As we've noted ad nauseam, this is not a very Trumpy district at all, but is the NRCC desperate to motivate the GOP's pro-Trump base? That's a terrible sign in and of itself.\n\nThere's no word on the size of the NRCC's buy, but according to CNN, the committee is also sending five field staffers into the district, to join six already there from the RNC (a number that's set to go up to 15). CLF is also running its own field program, reportedly with 90 staffers. That's a lot of bodiesand moneyto throw at this problem. Someone's getting panicked.\n\n FL-18: Republican Rep. Brian Mast won his first term in 2016 against a well-funded Democratic opponent by a rather comfortable 54-43 spread, while Donald Trump prevailed in the 18th District by a similar 53-44 margin. However, that doesn't seem to be stopping Democrats from trying to target this seat in 2018, which is located north of West Palm Beach and was represented by Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy until he unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2016. The latest name to arise via Roll Call's Simone Path as a possible challenger to Mast is attorney Jonathan Chane, who lost the Democratic primary for the open seat in 2016. However, it's unclear if Chane himself is interested in another campaign.\n\n KS-04: Either Republican Ron Estes is very unworried about the April 11 special election for Kansas' 4th Congressional District, or he's dangerously lazy. The candidates, who were both chosen at party conventions in early February, both just filed reports with the FEC detailing their fundraising through March 22, and Estes, the current state treasurer, had raised only $283,000 by that date. That wasn't much more than his Democratic opponent, attorney James Thompson, took in during the same timeframe: $252,000. Both Estes and Thompson have also spent similar amounts, leaving them with around $110,000 apiece for the stretch run.\n\nIn all likelihood, though, Estes has little to fear despite his soft haul, given how red this district is (it voted 60-33 for Trump). However, he still felt it necessary to run a TV ad attacking Thompson (albeit not by name) in which he literally stands in a swamp wearing wadersbedecked with a \"Ron Estes\" bumper sticker!and stiffly complains that \"liberal activists are trying to steal this election by supporting the Bernie Sanders-backed lawyer because they know he will vote the way Pelosi tells him to\" as snakes slither on-screen. Subtle.\n\nThompson also has an ad out, but it's a positive biographical spot in which he discusses his impoverished upbringing and his service in the Army. He also speaks about fighting for veterans, working families, and \"our personal freedoms\" as he's shown shooting a rifle. The only jab at Estes appears in text on-screen, about his refusal to appear at a debate. But while Thompson may be the target of Estes' barbs, Estes is probably just playing it safe. If Republicans were really worried, they'd mobilize the cavalrylike they are in Georgia.\n\nGrab Bag\n\n Maps: Decision Desk HQ has put together a mesmerizing national map of the 2016 presidential election results by precinct for all 50 states plus D.C.

Science thrives on such counterintuitive challenges, but there was no evidence for Duesbergs beliefs, which turned out to be baseless. Once researchers found HIV, doctors and public health officials were able to save countless lives through measures aimed at preventing its transmission. The Duesberg business might have ended as just another quirky theory defeated by research. The history of science is littered with such dead ends. In this case, however, a discredited idea nonetheless managed to capture the attention of a national leader, with deadly results. Thabo Mbeki, then the president of South Africa, seized on the idea that AIDS was caused not by a virus but by other factors, such as malnourishment and poor health, and so he rejected offers of drugs and other forms of assistance to combat HIV infection in South Africa. By the mid-2000s, his government relented, but not before Mbekis fixation on AIDS denialism ended up costing, by the estimates of doctors at the Harvard School of Public Health, well over three hundred thousand lives and the births of some thirty-five thousand HIV-positive children whose infections could have been avoided. Mbeki, to this day, thinks he was on to something.

Battling Parkinsons disease and recovering from two back surgeries, he appeared on the Senate floor with the help of a walker and gave Republicans their 50th vote for a measure that would kill an Obama administration rule prohibiting states from blocking federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood. Two GOP senators supportive of Planned Parenthood, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had already voted no on the bill, and Vice President Mike Pence was waiting for Isakson so he could cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of the resolution.

It concerns the White Houses competenceor lack thereof. Ten weeks ago, when Trump stormed into office attacking the media and promising a blitzkrieg of new policies and initiatives during his first hundred days, the dominant emotion among people who hadnt voted for him was fear. Many commentators, myself included, warned about the dangers of democratic erosion, and sales of George Orwells 1984 soared. Today, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned about Trump and his illiberalism. The White Houses recent decision to dismantle President Obamas clean-air regulations offers fresh testament to the malevolence of the Trump Administrations agenda, and next weeks meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, Chinas President, will be a reminder of the enormous responsibilities that rest on a Presidents shoulders. But, even among ardent Trumpophobes, fear and foreboding have been supplemented by wonderment at the White Houses string of gaffes.

The increase in mortality among WNH is centered mostly among those lacking higher education and appears to have few geographical restrictions. The increase in morbidity has not only increased the number of people on Social Security, but will also impact Medicare as this cohort ages into retirement.\n\nJoseph Stiglitz lays much of the blame for the increase in deaths from suicide, drugs, and alcoholism on our growing economic inequality, and on the high price we, as a nation, pay for medical care which, for too long, has put it out of the reach of those who need it most. Stiglitz also mentions the increase in mortality that occurred in Russia after the dissolution of the USSR.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Russia saw an alarming increase in the mortality of its men as their life expectancy fell by six years, while that of women fell by three. By 2006, Russias mortality rate, which had been 38 percent higher than that of Western Europe in 1980, increased to a level of 135 percent. Granted, they have been dealing with their own AIDS epidemic as well as a large jump in tuberculosis infections, many of which appear to be antibiotic resistant. But most of the increase comes from mortalities due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which are currently 3.8 times greater than the rate of CVD mortality in Western Europe. Deaths from external events (injuries, accidents, poisonings) increased from 2.5 times more than Western Europe in 1980 to 5.3 times greater in 2006. From a spring 2009, World Affairs Journal article by Nicholas Eberstadt:\n\nTaken together, then, deaths from cardiovascular disease and from injuries and poisoning have evidently been the main drivers of modern Russias strange upsurge in premature mortality and its broad, prolonged retrogression in public health conditions. One final factor that is intimately associated with both of these causes of mortality is alcohol abuse.\n\nThe damage done by alcohol in Russia is much worse than here in the U.S. due to the popularity of home brews known as samogon. Often filled with impurities, these home brews have contributed to the death rate due to alcohol poisoning. Local studies have shown that alcohol is a direct factor in premature death, including one in a city in the Urals that ...\n\nindicated that over 40 percent of the younger male decedents evaluated had probably been alcohol-impaired or severely intoxicated at the time of deathincluding one quarter of the deaths from heart disease and over half of those from accidents or injuries.\n\nSo, when looking at a chart like the one below that was part of the original study done by Case and Denton, notice that the other nations all have decent health care available to all citizens. The Russian health care safety net is not unlike the one that exists in too many parts of the United States todaysomewhere between very weak and nonexistent. It would be interesting to see how a chart that included Russia would look.\n\nAll-cause mortality, ages 4554 for US White non-Hispanics (USW), US Hispanics (USH), and six comparison countries: France (FRA), Germany (GER), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada (CAN), Australia (AUS), and Sweden (SWE).\n\nMichelle A. Parsons published Dying Unneeded: The Cultural Context of the Russian Mortality Crisis in 2014. A sociocultural anthropologist with a background in global health, Parsons interviewed Muscovites in an attempt to find the cultural causes of the increase in mortality. She found that after the collapse of the USSR, middle-aged Russians were faced with an economy that no longer provided stable, secure employment, and that the retirement system had collapsed, leaving the future uncertain with few prospects for improvement. They no longer felt needed, by their society or by their families. Parsons looks at the involvement of alcohol in the increased mortality rate and:\n\ntheorizes that drinking is, for what its worth, an instrument of adapting to the harsh reality and sense of worthlessness that would otherwise make one want to curl up and die.\n\nOne wonders how much of that attitude is shared by the middle-aged Americans that Case and Deaton have examined.

Dont worry, all we need around here is to change the entire way the current White House team is structured.\n\nIn interviews over the last week, several senior [White House] aides said they were carefully examining how the beleaguered administration functions as they weigh possible fixes. Among the top concerns: The circular firing squad continually playing out in the press pitting top aides against one another  a dynamic that one senior adviser described as increasingly unsustainable. It will have to either stop or there will have to be decisions made, this person said, hinting that more serious changes would be made if the incessant shooting doesnt end.\n\nThat would be \"several senior aides\" grousing about how they'd be making good progress and not have bungled every policy issue they've attempted, from healthcare to the \"travel ban\", if it weren't for all the other bastards in the administration fouling them up. And though its framed as an all-on-all fight, which would be consistent with every other report of Trumps buffoonish management style, Reince Priebus still seems to be the one most in the crosshairs.\n\nThe first changes are already afoot. Walsh became the West Wings first casualty, when it was announced on Thursday that she would be departing to help run a pro-Trump outside group. Within the White House, the departure was seen as a blow to the influence of chief of staff Reince Priebus, who counted Walsh as a longtime lieutenant. [...] Those who have spoken with Priebus in recent days said he has expressed frustration with his own diminished power in the West Wing and with Walshs departure. One person close to the president described Walsh, who was an accomplished Republican fundraiser before becoming Priebuss top aide, as the chief of staffs oxygen tank.\n\nBut wait!

One of the most interesting was the plesiadapiformes, a sort of early-model lemur, and the forerunners of ambulocetids, a sort of mammalian crocodile that would eventually evolve into all the whales and dolphins on Earth today.\n\nBut what really characterizes the PETM came into view just a few decades ago, as paleontology and geochemistry conspired to tease out the details of what was up until then a poorly-defined extinction event. Some of the initial clues are a sharp drop in some microorganisms, even deep water foraminifera, and large blooms in others, including various kinds of nasty algae. The world warmed upa lot. The resulting acidification almost certainly devastated reefs and appears to have reached into the mud lying at the bottom of the deepest trenches.\n\nGenerally speaking, when you see huge shifts in climate like this driven by natural causes (unless someone wants to get into some kind of uncharted alien intervention or the rise and fall of intelligent cynodonts burning fossil fuels), it means more than one factor may have ganged up. There are plenty of contenders, like a volcanic field in Canada dating to about the right time; or changes in earths orbit that, in the absence of ice caps, may have tipped the climate over; or the clathrate gun hypothesis; or events as dramatic as the great carbon comet impact, and even as subtle as the Isthmus of Panama pinching off the Atlantic and Pacific, and on and on. But the evidence or magnitude (or both) of all these is lacking in some way. We really dont know.\n\nWhat is clear is a bunch of plants and animals died, en masse, on land and by sea. Everything from muck-sucking marine worms to some of the latest furry inventions of evolution disappeared. Whole taxons up to the family level were wiped out. Other vertebrate lines, particularly mammals, evolved furiously, radiating into new eco-niches, presumably under intense selective pressure. And it happened fast by natural standards, in two waves. The first may have lasted only a few millennia, and the second perhaps 20,000 years or less.\n\nBy the time it was over a new epoch had dawned, the Eocene. Its an epoch that would end up stretching out for so long it might need to be broken into several distinct sub-epochs. And the world soon grew tired of the heat, and settled down to a more equitable climate.\n\nThe PETM can tell us a lot about how high and how fast the temperature might change, and it gives us hints about the biological fallout. The time bore enough similarities to today, both in terms of climate and biota, that its about the best we have to go by when guessing what lies in wait for usand soon.\n\nBut heres the thing that will be different this time: there seems to have been no permanent ice at either pole during the Paleocene. So sea levels didnt change much, even where temperatures soared. Perhaps a score of thick mountain glaciers melted, the thermal expansion of water might have kicked in, and raised sea levels a few feet. But that appears to be the size of it. This time, sea levels will eventually rise at least dozens of feet and maybe 100 or more, and fairly quickly.

Doors were locked to prevent theft and unauthorized breaks. They also opened the wrong way, and many of the young women were trampled trying to escape. Long tables and machinery blocked escape routes for many of the workers. There was no sprinkler system, and there were no fire extinguishers. Fire department ladders were not long enough to reach the eighth, ninth, and 10th floors.\n\nThat day saw the deaths of 123 young women and 23 men.

It told the story of Jurgis Rudkis, an immigrant trying to find his way and support his family in his new country. This book tells a tale of food poisoning, work accidents, unsafe and unsanitary practices in the meat-packing industry, and the exploitation of immigrant workers who came to America for a better life, only to find that they are surrounded by employers that treat them as if they are expendable and con men who want to take what little money they have.\n\nWhat do the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and The Jungle have in common?\n\nBoth of them led to government regulations. The Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 led to the creation of what we know today as the Food and Drug Administration.

He wrote a piece titled \"Republicans lied about healthcare for years, and they're about to get the punishment they deserve\" that everyone should read.\n\nFor years, Republicans promised lower premiums, lower deductibles, lower co-payments, lower taxes, lower government expenditure, more choice, the restoration of the $700 billion that President Barack Obama heartlessly cut out of Medicare because he hated old people, and (in the particular case of the Republican who recently became president) \"insurance for everybody\" that is \"much less expensive and much better\" than what they have today. They were lying. Over and over and over and over, Republicans lied to the American public about healthcare. It was impossible to do all of the things they were promising together, and they knew it. Then they unexpectedly won an election and had to face the question of whether they would break all of their promises  or only some of them.\n\nBut it did not end there. Barro points out that it is always easy for Republicans to lie about health care, because they simply give it little thought.\n\nThe difference on healthcare is that Republicans never had an ideology about it. So they were willing to lie, and there are two facts about the healthcare debate that a liar can exploit quite effectively until he is actually expected to make policy. People are always upset about how much healthcare costs, and healthcare is very complicated, so it is hard for voters to tell whether a politician is actually able to keep his or her promises about it.\n\nBarro ends the piece with a few words that encapsulate the fraud perpetrated by Republicans on their constituents.\n\nThrough the years, healthcare experts on the right have allowed themselves to be used as window dressing for a party that was never actually interested in taking their policy advice. The experts would write white papers about conservative approaches to health care. Republican politicians would indignantly wave the white papers around and insist that they had not only one plan for healthcare but many plans, and they involved high-risk pools and selling insurance across state lines and something-something patient-centered mumble mumble mumble and whatever was in the paper was going to be way better than Obamacare. Ryan even developed an undeserved reputation as a healthcare \"wonk.\" But those white papers were always just paper. The plans described in them were never going to be implemented by an actual Republican government, which would not be interested in paying for the plans the papers described. The only thing Republicans ever intended to use them for was indignant waving. It was all a lie. And the lie is finally about to be punished.\n\nTrumpcare, aka Paul Ryan's Affordable Health Care Act, was one of the most evil pieces of legislation ever written. How do you look into the eyes of your constituents, a large percentage of them who are on Obamacare, and tell them a plan from which billions of dollars were gutted could possibly be less expensive and more beneficial?\n\nObamacare is no longer underwater in the polls. But it does have systemic problems that are unavoidable, because it was an attempt to apply market principles to a system that the market cannot and must not control. Our approachmaking health insurance and health care a marketable productis not only evil and immoral, but unsustainable. Now were reaping the results of that reality, and its a reality that every politician already knows deep inside.\n\nMSNBC's Ali Velshi points out that other than the U.S., no industrialized country has a market-based health care system. Moreover, they all have better outcomes, are much less expensive than the United States, and all of their citizens are covered. Our politicians know that and must be punished for not accepting that reality and legislating accordingly. The grassroots movements that are budding throughout the country intend to do just that, making sure enough of them are defeated to reclaim the Senate, the House, and many state houses.\n\nWe will take the country back from the oligarchs.

These emails were found on a computer, mind you, that belonged neither to Clinton nor a high-ranking staffer but to the sext-addicted spouse of her top aidelets not even utter his name. Comey himself said, we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails. He sent the letter before actually looking at the damn emails. Going over what happened again only makes it seem more absurd.\n\nIf Comey had simply done what decades of precedent and policy prescribed, i.e., kept his big trap shut until and unless his agents found something that wouldve required reopening a closed criminal investigation, there would never have been a President Trump. But he didnt, either because of ego or because he couldnt control the rogue, pro-Trump elements within his own agency (one agent referred to the FBI as Trumplandia) who might have been preparing to leak the story of these new emails on their own. Its probably some of each but either way, nothing will ever change the fact that what Comey did in the days leading up to the 2016 election will always be the first line in his obituary, and the crux of his legacy as a public servant.\n\nDespite the best efforts of House Intelligence Chair White House stooge Devin Nunes, we will hopefully find out the full extent to which Vladimir Putin was able to influence our election, as well as the degree to which Trump people and perhaps the candidate himself enabled Moscow to do so, and Comey will help in that process.

We ask that you begin the work of improving health care for millions of Americans by rescinding your January 20th executive order.\n\nThe entire reason the GOP bill was broken into 3 phases with the first being a reconciliation bill  when there was nothing yet to reconcile  was because it was a method to completely cut Democrats out of the process and sidestep a filibuster. As Ive said before the tactic trapped them with a bill that really didnt change any laws significantly so they essentially couldnt do what they claimed they wanted to do as Paul Ryan admitted during his fancy power-point presentation.\n\nThere are only so many things you can do in that bill because of the Senate floor rules for reconciliation. You can't put everything you want in that legislation because if you did, it would be filibustered and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the Senate.\n\nWith this letter announcing that 44 Senate Democrats are open to work in a bipartisan way, only 16 Republican Senators would have to agree to get past the 60 vote filibuster threshold and implement some substantive changes.\n\nDemocrats have a opportunity to step up and make the Republicans a set of offers they dare not ignore or refuse. Perhaps they should do as they did with the ACA itself and adapt ideas that the Republicans have already had, and seem to desperately want, and put them into practice in a way that actually would do what they claim  but only if theyre willing to accept some Democratic ideas as well.\n\nI think this is an opportunity for Democrats, I think they should call Trumps bluff on saying hes willing to work with Democrats. Its a chance for them to be the better and bigger person(s). Republicans had a kegger party without Dems that got busted up by the cops, somebody spiked the punch, half a dozen people tried to cannon-ball from the roof, the pool is now a toxic with urine but Democrats are not just gonna sit here and laugh at cha. Well, not entirely.\n\nI believe that Democrats actually do have some ideas on how to clean this mess up. Here are a few examples that Im placing on the floor for open discussion and comment.`\n\nIncreasing Competition\n\nThe Republican plan constantly touted the goal of expanding competition which in theory would reduce premiums and costs by allowing for insurance plans to be offered and bought across state lines. The first problem with this is that that feature already exists as part of the ACAs Multi-State Plan Program which so far has only attracted a single insurer  Blue Cross/Blue Shield  and is only available in 25 states.\n\nMutl-State Plan availability\n\nBesides the fact that this would cut the state insurance commissions and their local regulatory rules out of the picture  although admittedly some of them are barely in it to start with as shown above  the next problem here is that an insurer has to have already established a network of providers in a state in order to offer insurance there, and not every insurer has the resources to do that across the entire nation.\n\nThe trouble is that varying or numerous state regulations arent the main reason insurance markets tend to be uncompetitive. Selling insurance in a new region or state takes more than just getting a license and including all the locally required benefits. It also involves setting up favorable contracts with doctors and hospitals so that customers will be able to get access to health care. Establishing those networks of health care providers can be hard for new market entrants. The barriers to entry are not truly regulatory, they are financial and they are network, said Sabrina Corlette, the director of the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.\n\nThis then, in additional to the fact this program is limited to non-profit organizations, is exactly why the MSP program hasnt taken off the way Republicans argue that selling across state lines would.\n\nOn the other side of the argument you have Senator Bernie Sanders who argues that we need either Single-Payer or Medicare-For-All in order to bring down prices and ensure access to those who are being priced out of the market by premium and deductible increases.\n\nGenerally speaking the cost of Medicare Part-A and B tends to be less than the private plans offered by Medicare Advantage with the exception of HMOs as noted by the CommonWealthFund.\n\nMedicare Advantage Costs high than Traditional Medicare Exhibit 2.

According to CMS, for common benefits, Medicare spending rose by an average of 4.3 percent each year between 1997 and 2009, while private insurance premiums grew at a rate of 6.5 percent per year. (See Table 13)\n\nAccording to a calculation by the National Academy for Social Insurance, if spending on Medicare rose at the same rate as private insurance premiums during that period, Medicare would have cost an additional $114 billion (or 31.7 percent). ...\n\nThe CBO has predicted that the rising cost of private insurance will continue to outstrip Medicare for the next 30 years. The private insurance equivalent of Medicare would cost almost 40 percent more in 2022 for a typical 65-year old.\n\nSimilar results have been found for Medicaid as well by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nUpdating and expanding on the previous research, another study 25 used MEPS data from 2005 and found that after adjusting for health and socio-demographic factors, total health care spending for a typical low-income Medicaid adult or child would have been far higher if covered by private health insurance. In particular, if a typical low-income Medicaid adult or child were instead covered by private health insurance, total spending would be 26 percent higher for adults and 37 percent higher for children. The study estimated that total health care spending would increase nearly 26 percent, from $5,671 per person per year to $7,126, if a typical low-income Medicaid adult were covered by private health insurance for a full year. In addition, total health care spending would increase 37 percent, from $909 per child per year to $1,247, if a low-income Medicaid or CHIP-enrolled child were covered instead by private health insurance for a full year.\n\nThe study also showed that out-of-pocket spending was estimated to be six to seven fold higher under private insurance than under public insurance.  A 2013 study 28 used pooled MEPS data from 2003 to 2009 to compare health care access, use, and spending for low-income adults enrolled in Medicaid to their counterparts with private employer-sponsored insurance.29 The authors found that regression-adjusted comparisons generally showed that enrollees are less costly to insure in Medicaid. In fact, adjusting for health and socio-demographic factors using multiple regression techniques, the study found that if a low-income adult enrolled in Medicaid was instead covered by private health insurance, insurer payments (not including out-of-pocket costs) would be over 25 percent higher.\n\nThe study also found that Medicaid provides access to health care services comparable to that of the privately insured sample but at significantly lower costs. In addition, the study found that the likelihood of using most health care services (e.g., primary care doctors, prescription drugs and inpatient care) would not differ significantly if Medicaid enrollees were instead covered by private insurance, with the exception of lower emergency department use and more specialist visits in private coverage.\n\nAdditionally, given the differences in benefit design between the private plans and Medicaid, out-of-pocket spending for health care services was estimated to be over three times as high if Medicaid enrollees were instead covered by private insurance.\n\nIf we want to provide national-wide low-cost insurance across state lines, the fastest and simplest option would be to allow both Medicare and Medicaid to be sold through the Multi-State Plan Programs existing gateway to those who are above the income threshold or otherwise too young to have those programs provided for free. Both Medicare and Medicaid have existing national networks of doctors and hospitals, so that wouldnt be an impediment to immediately increase the number of options available when markets may be shrinking or mergers like the ones that were recently dropped between Aetna with Cigna and Humana which tends to decrease the number of current insurance providers.\n\nRight now the Multi-State program already supports non-profit plans, but in exchange for allowing it to support the direct purchase of Medicare and Medicaid, it could also include private for-profit plans  which would by definition be national or already have networks in multiple states  so that consumers can make any choice they would prefer. Democrats could offer this as a deal, theyll support adding private plans to the MSP, as long as Medicare & Medicaid for All are included in the mix. Everybody would get something they want and the argument of which is better would play itself out in the marketplace.\n\nNow part of the reason I suggest both Medicare and Medicaid is the fact that both of them have gaps in their coverage  no dental or visual for Medicaid, no long-term care on Medicare  which could be solved if consumer could by both or there was an option to combine them. Also the issue of the Medi-Gap should be addressed and the Doc Fix made permanent for these plans on the MSP because paying full price for services would help increase their networks to more providers, and the cost-shifting that occurs when providers are underpaid would be discouraged allowing prices for those in the rest of the system to drop in return.\n\nUnder this idea people could choose whatever they prefer. Choices would be greater as would competition. If private plans can beat the prices and quality available from Medicare or Medicaid, so be it. Under this plan theyd have some real competition to keep up with.\n\nControlling High Insurance Rate Increases\n\nContrary to the claims of the GOP the ACA actually does have mechanisms for handling insurance rate increases when they are 10% or more,\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that insurers planning to significantly increase plan premiums submit their rates to either the state or federal government for review. The threshold for this requirement is 10%. The rate review process is designed to improve insurer accountability and transparency. It ensures that experts evaluate whether the proposed rate increases are based on reasonable cost assumptions and solid evidence and gives consumers the chance to comment on proposed increases. The ACA also requires that a summary of rate review justifications and results be accessible to the public in an easily understandable format. This site is designed to meet that mandate.\n\nLooking at Arizona which has been frequently brought up you can use the ACA Rate Review search to list and organize price increases for all the plans in the state. there was only one plan  Pheonix Health Plans (PHP) for the Individual Market that went up 163%. Under the ACA they had to explain their reasons which were basically that they didnt have the experience to properly set their rates in the first place,\n\nSince PHP does not have credible actuarial experience for the base period of 2014, the increases are primarily driven by an increase in the manual rate. Prior to the 2017 rates, the manual rate was based on large group experience and adjusted to the individual market, considering the expected average health of the market. For 2017, the 2014 individual market experience was used to develop the manual rate, adjusting for the expected 2017 individual population. The 2014 individual experience appears to show a market with significantly more adverse selection than assumed in 2016, i.e., the claims costs are significantly higher than those observed in the group markets. The overall manual is increasing approximately 84 percent from that assumed in 2016. This is the primary driver of the increase. The factors influencing the manual rate increase include issuer exits from the market, higher assumed risk profile of the 2017 market due to the large rate increases in the market and higher provider costs due to greater than previously expected out of network costs.\n\nOne insurance plan correcting their own mistake should be taken as a guide for the entire nation. Most Individual market plans in Arizona only went up a fraction of this amount and several in the small group market actually went down, but the downside is that state laws need to be passed to allow an Insurance Commissioner to reject exorbitant increases, and many states  particularly those who havent fully implemented the ACA  havent done that. Arizona happens to be one of those states, and in fact theyve only partially instituted their rate review program for the individual market only, their small market rate review is handled Federally. Some states like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming and Missouri dont have an effective rate review program at all, HHS has to do it for them, and they dont have any mechanism to block high rate increases.\n\nState Rate Review Programs\n\nGenerally speaking states that havent fully embraced the provisions of the ACA have seen higher rates increases.\n\nThe states which are 100% on board with the ACA exchange provisions (running their own full state-based marketplace, expanding medicaid and sticking to the original cut-off date for \"transitional\" policies) average around 18%. If you remove Minnesota from the equation, it's just 15.2%. Insurance Rate increases by State Those which implemented only one or two of the above provisions come in at around 26%. In a possibly coincidental quirk, all five fo the \"halfway\" state exchange states (Hawaii, Oregon, Nevada, Kentucky and New Mexico) just happen to also fall into this category as well, which is completely appropriate. Finally, states which are fighting the ACA kicking and screaming (no Medicaid expansion, no state exchange and allowing transitional plan extensions as long as possible) are averaging around 30%.\n\nThe outlier states who are far above the average include Tennessee, Oklahoma, Illinois, Arizona, West Virginia, Montana and Minnesota.\n\nA simple solution to this problem is that now that there is a nationwide rate review process in place, we may need to authorize HHS to reject unreasonable increases where current state laws are lacking in this area  just as weve had the Federal government implement exchanges when the states have refused to do so on their own.\n\nCreating Jobs\n\nRepublicans have repeated claimed the ObamaCare is a job Killer. Part of that view is based in the explorer mandate which requires business to provide healthcare for their employees if they work more than 20 Hrs/week. Theyve argued that this causes employers to keep their workers on part time with less than 20 hours specifically so that they dont have to pay for health care. Unfortunately for them repeated studies of this have not turned out the way they predict.\n\nA new study further undercuts a major claim by critics of the Affordable Care Act, who contended that the law would encourage companies to slash full-time workers' hours and shift them into part-time work in order to avoid having to offer them health insurance. The research \"found little evidence that the ACA had caused increases in part-time employment as of 2015,\" according to a summary of the findings published in the journal Health Affairs on Tuesday. \"We can say with a large degree of confidence that there is nothing we can see nationwide when we look at the whole workforce\" that would support a claim that the so-called employer mandate or other Obamacare features have led to increases in part-time employment at the expense of full-time jobs, said Kosali Simon, a professor at Indiana University, and a co-author of the report.\n\nWhat they often ignore is the fact that the ACA provides a 50% tax credit to small businesses to help them pay for the cost of providing healthcare.\n\nIf you are a small employer, there is a tax credit that can put money in your pocket. The small business health care tax credit benefits employers that: Have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n\nPay average wages of less than $50,000 a year per full-time equivalent (indexed annually for inflation beginning in 2014) For tax years 2015 and 2016, the inflation-adjusted amount is $52,000\n\nPay at least half of employee health insurance premiums To be eligible for this credit, you must have purchased coverage through the small business health options program, also known as the SHOP marketplace. For tax years 2010 through 2013, the maximum credit is 35 percent of premiums paid for small business employers and 25 percent of premiums paid for small tax-exempt employers such as charities. For tax years beginning in 2014 or later, there are changes to the credit: The maximum credit increases to 50 percent of premiums paid for small business employers and 35 percent of premiums paid for small tax-exempt employers.\n\nTo be eligible for the credit, a small employer must pay premiums on behalf of employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace or qualify for an exception to this requirement.\n\nThe credit is available to eligible employers for two consecutive taxable years.\n\nFor employers below 25 full-time equivalent employees this is a fairly good deal. But then what happens for those above 25 full-time employees? Do they suddenly lose the tax credit? At the very least they should be able to retain the credit for the first 25 FTE employees when they reach number 26, 27 or 30. The ACA employer mandate doesnt kick-in until the company has 50 FTE employees, so going further perhaps the tax credit should be expanded up to the 50 FTE point at 35% so that their isnt as large a gap and steep climb for those businesses that are on the verge of outgrowing 25 FTE but are deterred from expanding at the risk of immediately losing their tax credit and having their healthcare costs immediately double.\n\nIt also might be wise to allow this credit to employers who are shopping in the Small Market as well as the SHOP marketplace. Yes of course the tax credit would have a negative impact on the deficit, but that should be somewhat offset by an increase in hours for workers and greater income tax revenues as more small companies are less discouraged from expanding.\n\nExpanding Choices\n\nThe other idea that was brought in at the end of the failed GOP plan was the idea of allowing states to adjust the ACA list of 10 Essential Health Benefits which now have to be included in all plans.\n\nOutpatient carethe kind you get without being admitted to a hospital Trips to the emergency room Treatment in the hospital for inpatient care Care before and after your baby is born Mental health and substance use disorder services: This includes behavioral health treatment, counseling, and psychotherapy Your prescription drugs Services and devices to help you recover if you are injured, or have a disability or chronic condition. This includes physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychiatric rehabilitation, and more. Your lab tests Preventive services including counseling, screenings, and vaccines to keep you healthy and care for managing a chronic disease. Pediatric services: This includes dental care and vision care for kids.\n\nThe argument here is that leaving holes in coverage for some plans essentially drives up the costs for those who actually need these services versus those who may not necessarily require them at certain points in time. The GOP wanted states to reshape this list  which when they also wanted plans sold across state lines would create an obvious conflict as some states would have had one set of essential benefits while another states benefits could have conflicted with them  but perhaps the end decision isnt better made by the state, perhaps the consumer should have the choice of deferring payments on one or more of the benefits when it doesnt currently apply for them in order to gain a discount on their premiums or deductibles.\n\nThis isnt to say they arent being covered, only that while they arent using this benefit  they can get a discount until they actually have a need for that benefit  and like the other GOP idea for those that going without coverage paying a premium when they restart coverage  they would begin paying for it from the point of use forward with an additional 20% or 30% surcharge for the rest of their current plan year.\n\nThe GOP actually do have a point that people without children may not need pediatric services, or men may not need prenatal care services, or some people may not have a chronic condition requiring physical or occupational therapy. People may justifiably argue they dont want to pay for something theyre probably never going to use, and theres a fair argument to be made that they should be able to opt-out in some cases. Since premiums are continuing to rise  albeit at a rate that is 40% less than they were prior to the ACA  granting this kind of flexibility to the consumers, as opposed to having it entirely under government control, might convince more people to buy insurance rather than pay the tax penalty or else have to face massive deductibles in order to get the lower premium rates.\n\nBut then again, situations can change  circumstances can change. No one expects that theyre going to need to go to an emergency room within a specific time frame, but these things do happen. Theres a good reason these benefits were made essential and why they should remain so. People can become pregnant unexpectedly, they can get into an accident or contract a chronic disease. Since insurance generally works based on those who are more healthy paying into a pool that helps provide needed support for the 15% of the public who have the more expensive care needs, the deferred payment with a surcharge would keep the healthier people in the pool and help prevent it from being drained because of their non-participation, paying the tax penalty which so many on the right deeply resent or else having them saddled with a unaffordable deductible,\n\nI think some of these ideas could be cost effective and might be something some Republicans could go for  in fact they might have a hard time turning down expanding competition across all states, implementing expanded tax relief for small business, increasing consumer choice and control, and ending exorbitant premium rate hikes  but on the other hand if they do choose to stonewall even their own ideas it places Democrats in an even stronger political position for 2018 by simply saying  If they wont, We Will. Either way, its a win for the Dems.\n\nThe floor is open to discuss.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/2/1648251/-Democrats-are-willing-to-step-up-to-the-plate-on-health-reform#read-more", "date": "2017/4/2"}, {"text": "JAKE TAPPER: On Friday you travel to the white house to view these documents that Chairman Nunez, your Republican counterpart, has discussed, and Nunez says that they suggest the raising of issues, issues that he has about incidental surveillance of trump advisers and maybe the president, himself.

Now you've seen these documents, can you understand why Chairman Nunez might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I can't go into the contents of the documents, Jake. I can't say I don't agree with the chairman's characterization which is where you don't share documents with one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees. But the most important thing people need to know about these documents is not classified and it's a couple of thing. First, the deputy assistant to the white house informed me when I went to see them that these are exactly the same materials that were shown to the chairman. Now this is a very interesting point. How does the white house know that these are the same materials that were shown to the chairman if the white house wasn't aware what the chairman was being shown? And the second point was also made to me, this is, I think, was also underscored by Sean Spicer and that is that it was told me by the deputy assistant the materials were produced during the ordinary course of business. The question for the white house and Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? I think the answer may come from the president, himself, and you can say a lot of things about the president, but one thing you cannot say is he's not subtle. And I think his tweets tell the story and the story is look over there at leaks and look over there at anything the Obama administration we can claim did wrong on incidental collection or anything else. But whatever you do, under no circumstances look here at me or at Russia. I think that is really what is going on.\n\nJAKE TAPPER: Do you think that chairman Nunez was part of an attempt to provide some sort of cover for the president's claim about Obama wiretapping him at Trump Tower which, obviously, this does not prove, but cover for that? Or an attempt to distract, as you're suggesting?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the white house and the question is why. I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the congress in other directions. Basically say don't look at me and don't look at Russia there is nothing to see here. I would tell people when whenever they see the president use the word fake it ought to set off alarm bells and I think that is really what has gone on here.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/2/1649517/-Rep-Adam-Schiff-has-two-important-new-questions-for-the-White-House-after-seeing-the-intel-docs#read-more", "date": "2017/4/2"}, {"text": "Each of us picks up on unique things and experiences in these kinds of circumstances. For some it might be sounds or smells or the very real sense of danger or fear. All of those things were certainly there. It was definitely loud. There was a variety of strange smells and, yes, it was indeed scary to be one of a handful of women in a sea of men in correctional institution. But that wasnt what most intimidated me.\n\nIn fact, while I expected to see hardened criminals, I mainly saw a bunch of really scared men, a great many of whom were my age or younger. For me, what stood out was the overwhelming lack of privacy. There were plexiglass windows everywherewhich I later found out was a specialized material made of a blend of polycarbonate, glass, and acrylic made to withstand high impact blows. It was extra thick and heavily glazed.\n\nAnd it was everywhere. Everywhere so you could see where the detainees ate and slept and had recreation time and showered and used the toilet. There was literally nowhere they could go without being watched, not even to do the most basic bodily human functions. As I walked through, I imagined what it would be like for them to have every single thing stripped away, including their most basic freedoms and dignity. And thats the part that felt the most inhumane.\n\nAnd then of course talking to the detainees broke my heart. As a Spanish speaker, I was asked to work with the Spanish-speaking detainees who had limited means of communicating since guards most often werent bilingual and interpreters and attorneys for immigrant detainees are not required by law. I am not a lawyer so other than being able to answer a few questions and take information, Im not sure I was all that helpful. Many of them couldnt really understand the complexities of why they were being detained and one kept repeating to me over and over again that he just wanted to go home. It was heartbreaking and sobering.\n\nAnd then, just mere weeks later, I found myself inside another immigrant detention facilitythis time on a delegation visit with Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. My organization was taking an active role in immigration reform and wanted to bring light to the conditions of immigrants in detention. There was a big tour, a press conference, a rally, lots of hoopla. There was lots of show but for a person doing work on the ground it felt empty, and it didnt free a single detainee. I came back impatient and numb.\n\nAfter that visit, my mind fixated on some of my relatives who were in various parts of their own immigration journey, and I couldnt help put transpose their faces on the faces of the detainees I saw and talked to inside of the facilities. Who were their loved ones? What must it feel like to be separated and have no contact? My body was exhausted from the emotional roller coaster of it all. Though I cannot remember the exact dates of the visits, I do remember this was right around Thanksgiving because I inexplicably burst into tears at the Thanksgiving dinner table that yearhelpless and frustrated about our mass incarceration system, angry about immigrant detention, and grateful that I didnt have to go back if I didnt want to.\n\nNine years later, after writing about Darren Rainey, Im reminded of my brief visit to those detention centers. I keep wondering how many of those people have languished in those facilities without due process, how many have died at the hands of guards like Rainey and so many others have, how many have been falsely accused. Im reminded of this violence, this gross, structural injustice in our system and I keep asking myself Whos responsible?\n\nThen Im reminded that there is no easy answer. The United States has the worlds largest immigrant detention system, as well as the highest incarceration rate in the world. Weve known this for years and some of us have silently accepted this as our fate, while the most abused among us have shouted that this was happening until their voices were sore.\n\nIn this moment of new awakenings, while we all seem to be paying attention, lets ask ourselves some critical questions about why this is and why this is allowed to beparticularly when we know that the government allows detention centers and prisons to be contracted out for profit, and that blacks and other people of color are disproportionately represented in the prison system. This is an intentional strategy and it has done nothing but serve to stifle the social and economic well-being of communities of color for generations.\n\nWhile we are doing the important work of organizing, educating, and resisting, this is an incredible opportunity to expose the harm that mass incarceration is doing to our society and work to build a better, fair, and more humane future. The time is now to hold us all accountable so that there are no more Darren Raineys, no more Sandra Blands, no more Jos de Jesses.\n\nNo more hashtags and unaccounted for deaths due to this prison system that has no regard for human life.\n\nFor more information:\n\nwww.theatlantic.com/...\n\nwww.prisonpolicy.org\n\nwww.amnestyusa.org/\n\nwww.aclu.org/", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/2/1648046/-Behind-the-plexiglass-Darren-Rainey-immigrant-detention-and-mass-incarceration#read-more", "date": "2017/4/2"}, {"text": "Even though the law passed in 1972, it took almost a decade for Title IX to survive challenges from lawmakers wanting to exempt revenue-producing mens sports from the law. It also had to survive lawmakers' attempts to exempt intercollegiate sports from the law altogether. It took three years to write and finalize the laws regulations and provisions. And they are still being challenged.\n\nThe National College Athletic Association challenged Title IXs legalityand lost. There has been court case after court case challenging the law on issues such as scholarships, funds allocated to mens and womens sports, and discrimination. The U.S. Department of Education, through the Office of Civil Rights, is still issuing further clarifications about the law, clarifications that have both strengthened it and weakened it over the years. A timeline from the Women's Sports Foundation provides a history of Title IX and its 45-year struggle. (The Womens Sports Foundation, by the way, was founded in 1974 by Billie Jean King to create leaders by ensuring girls access to sports.)\n\nYet when you look at school sports programs today, theres no question of how much things have changed. Girls sports still arent equal, but participation has become so commonplace that it's hard to imagine how school existed without sports teams for girls.\n\nToday, an equal number of elementary-age girls as boys sign up for T-ball and soccer. Those women on the U.S. womens hockey team have played sports since they were young.\n\nIt wasnt always that way.\n\nIf you graduated high school after the 1970s, you might not remember a time when many teenage girls didnt have access to high school sports.\n\nBack then, I remember that my athletically inclined friends could play a few intramural sports but couldnt compete against other schools. They would gain the sometimes derogatory reputation of being jocks. Some schools did have competition for womens teams in a few sports such as gymnastics, but hardly all. But girls could always try out for cheerleading or for the pom-pon squad, right? Or join the school dance troupe?\n\nFor younger kids, Little League was for boys. So was flag football. Girls were steered more toward dance or tennis lessons, both activities that cost money and thus were unavailable to those from poorer communities. As for college sports, well, there were football and basketball and other, smaller sportsfor men. College sports for women were on a separate track. Athletic scholarships were certainly not for female students.\n\nTitle IX changed all that. Before Title IX, only one in 27 girls played sports, says the Womens Sports Foundation. Today, that number is two in five.\n\nWithout Title IX, there wouldnt be enough womens basketball talent coming up through the school system to populate professional womens sports like the WNBA. Who won the most medals for the U.S. at the 2016 Olympics in Rio? Women. The U.S. women took home 61 medals to the mens 55. But that was a long time coming, according to a story from NPR:\n\nAt the 1972 Olympics in Munich, American women won 23 medals compared with 71 for the U.S. men. The women didn't win a single medal in gymnastics and had no golds in track and field. But that same year, the U.S. Congress passed Title IX, barring sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding. This has helped revolutionize women's sports at both the high school and college levels. American women are now dominant in many sports, including gymnastics, swimming, basketball, rowing, water polo and soccer. Americans took gold in all of those sports, except soccer, where they were upset by Sweden.\n\nAfter the 1975 regulations were finalized, elementary schools had one year to comply with the equality in athletics requirements of Title IX. High schools had until July 1978, and colleges had until the 1978-79 school year. Although some schools and school systems continued to fight the law, many embraced the new opportunities to break new ground and surge ahead, like the time Lisa Leslie became the first woman to slam dunk in WNBA history.\n\nI vividly remember the first Illinois high school basketball championship tournament for girls being played at Illinois State University in 1977. I wrote about it for a central Illinois newspaper at my first job out of college. (This was a feature story; the sports section sent its own reporter to give it full coverage.) High school state championship tournaments are always exciting for sports fans and families, but the crowd watching the first high school girls basketball team win a state championship went certifiably nuts. To the proud parents and classmates, it didnt matter that the guys on the basketball court were girls.\n\nThe cheerleaders who one week earlier were cheering for the boys teams were back, this time cheering for the girls teams. This time around, one cheerleader told me, it meant a lot more, because so many of the girls on the team were good friends.\n\nThe first national collegiate championship for women was held in 1941, in golf. Some womens sports started growing at the college level in the 1950s and 1960s, with schools competing against other nearby schools. Womens sports developed their own national championship series and their own organization, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, as participation in various sports grew, but those efforts were still dwarfed by mens competition. The AIAW finally disbanded in 1982 after all womens sports came under the auspices of the NCAA. Women athletes started receiving college athletic scholarships in 1974.\n\nFull equality in womens sports is still falling short, at the school and professional levels, in both opportunities and payment for professionals.

Black Americans of voting age are more than four times more likely to lose their voting rights than the rest of the adult population, with one of every 13 black adults disenfranchised nationally. In four states  Florida (21 percent), Kentucky (26 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), and Virginia (22 percent  more than one in five black adults is disenfranchised. In total, 2.2 million black citizens are banned from voting.\n\nJoin me in examining the problem, and looking at groups who are fighting back and could use your support.\n\nFirst stop is Florida, and the work of Floridians for a Fair Democracy:\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nFlorida Supreme Court considers allowing vote to end permanent felon disenfranchisement\n\nFlorida currently has one of the strictest felon disenfranchisement laws in the country  only Florida, Kentucky, Virginia, and Iowa permanently bar those with felony convictions from voting for life, unless they seek clemency. The clemency process in Florida is notoriously difficult. During his term, former Gov. Charlie Crist made it easier for former felons to regain their rights, restoring the right to vote to more than 155,000 felons. But current Gov. Rick Scott (R) reversed that change in 2011 and mandated a waiting period before felons could even apply for clemency. Just 2,487 people have regained their voting rights since Scott took office in 2010. Floridians for a Fair Democracy chair Demond Meade is one of the more than one and a half million Floridians who cannot vote in elections, including last years election when his wife ran for state legislature. In 2008, it hurt not to be able to be a part of a historic election, but I have even more pain now because I cant even vote for my own wife, he told ThinkProgress before Floridas primary in March 2016. Its un-American and totally unfair. I should have that right. Floridas disenfranchisement law dates back to the post-Civil War era when the state specifically wanted to keep black residents from gaining political power. Voting advocates have pointed to its racist past in pushing for a legal change, arguing that former felons are better able to reintegrate into society when they are able to regain their rights.\n\nNational organizations who address voting rights include the previously mentioned Sentencing Project and:\n\nI am also keeping my eyes turned to the newly formed National Democratic Redistricting Committee chaired by Eric Holder, which will be addressing Republican gerrymandering/redistricting.\n\nRepublican gerrymandered districts after the 2010 Census have put Democrats at a massive structural disadvantage. Thats why the most important turning point for the future of the Democratic Party will take place in 2021: when states redraw their Congressional and state legislative lines. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) is an organization of Democratic leaders enacting a comprehensive, multi-cycle Democratic Party redistricting strategy over the next 5 years and beyond. Chaired by former Attorney General Eric Holder, the NDRC was created in 2016 to build a targeted, state-by-state strategy that ensures Democrats can produce fairer maps in the 2021 redistricting process. With fairer maps, Democrats can rebuild the party from the state level, and secure a stable federal majority for the decade to come.\n\nHolder has called for the restoration of voting rights.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nOne of the journalists you should follow who focuses on voting issues is Ari Berman, author of Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\n\nCountless books have been written about the civil rights movement, but far less attention has been paid to what happened after the dramatic passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1965 and the turbulent forces it unleashed. Give Us the Ballot tells this story for the first time. In this groundbreaking narrative history, Ari Berman charts both the transformation of American democracy under the VRA and the counterrevolution that has sought to limit voting rights, from 1965 to the present day. The act enfranchised millions of Americans and is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of the civil rights movement. And yet, fifty years later, we are still fighting heated battles over race, representation, and political power, with lawmakers devising new strategies to keep minorities out of the voting booth and with the Supreme Court declaring a key part of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional.\n\nHere is Berman discussing his book with journalist Bob Herbert:\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nWeve heard an incredible amount of noise from Republicans about alleged voter fraud, and from Donald Trump, who said, even after he was elected president, that millions of people had voted illegally. Now we have the reports from the men and women of both parties who supervised the 2016 general election all across the country. The consensus was overwhelming. Out of 137 million ballots cast, the number of fraudulent votes that occurred was close to zero. Trumps claim that millions of people voted illegally was preposterous. But what was demonstrably true was the continuing outrageous, and often outrageously successful, efforts by Republicans to prevent Americans from exercising their legal right to vote. The abhorrent practice of voter suppression is alive and well, and its shameful stain is spreading now that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been so disastrously undermined. Bob talks about this with guest, Ari Berman, a senior contributing writer for The Nation magazine and author of the book, Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\n\nWhere do your elected officials stand on voting rights and felon disenfranchisement? If they dont have a statement on their web pages, drop them a query or give them a call to find out why not.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has been outspoken on the issue, joining with other senators to introduce the Democracy Restoration Act in 2015.\n\nU.S. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) along with Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), have introduced a bill, the Democracy Restoration Act, to strengthen communities by reducing recidivism rates through the restoration of voting rights to individuals after they have served their time and have been released from incarceration. S. 772 would restore voting rights in federal elections to the million Americans who are out of prison and living in the community. Studies indicate that former prisoners who have voting rights restored are less likely to reoffend, and that disenfranchisement hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into their community. They were joined by Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Companion legislation will be introduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nMissouri Democrat Jason Kander has launched \"Let America Vote.\"\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nFrom the website:\n\nExtreme voter suppression laws that disproportionately impact people based on their race or ethnicity, gender, age, or income have started popping up all over the country. If we dont fight back, more and more Americans will become disenfranchised.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't include a clip from my favorite grassroots leader: the Rev.

All said they had voted for Trump, and all were bewildered that he wanted to cut funds that channel people into good manufacturing jobs. Theres a lot of wasteful spending, so cut other places, Moreno said. Payton suggested that if the government wants to cut budgets, it should target Obama phones provided to low-income Americans. (In fact, the program predates President Barack Obama and is financed by telecom companies rather than by taxpayers.) Yet Democrats gleeful at the prospect of winning penitent voters back should take a deep breath. These voters may be irritated, but I was struck by how loyal they remain to Trump.\n\nTrump voters not only remain loyal to Trump even after he cuts programs vital to their own lives, they do so because they believe that, somewhere out there, in some other place, there are black people getting something free. Got it. 1) Yes, apparently someone is still assigned to write this story each week, and 2) someone wake up the person whose job it is to give a furious Trump voters arent racists and Democrats need to address their issues comment this week. Thankfully, thats not me.\n\nEmily Bazelon and Eric Posner look into what it could mean to seat Neil Gorush.\n\nThe reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the structure of modern government  including the rules that keep our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon, who has called for its deconstruction. The Republican-dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely curtail the power of federal agencies.\n\nIn a way, the Tea Party folks were telling the truththis is a second American revolution. And its designed to roll back the first.\n\nAs the court has recognized over and over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as well as labor, the updating of regulations cant wait for Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.  In the past 20 years, conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only Congress  not agencies  can create rules.  And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in.\n\nGorsuch isnt arguing against specific regulations, hes arguing against the idea of regulations. Under Gorsuchs theory of the Constitution, bills would have to be written to address every specific detail and agencies would be unable to do more than enforce bills as written on the exact situations that were anticipated in advance. Its a formula designed to destroy both the regulatory agencies and the Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nColbert King goes back to the Nixon era to find a spittle as licky as Devin Nunes.\n\nWatergate showcased legislators on Capitol Hill in their finest hour: folksy and clever Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee; Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), the committees vice chairman (What did the president know, and when did he know it?); House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.), who reportedly went to a back room after voting for the third article of impeachment, called his wife and wept, telling her, I hope weve done the right thing; and Barbara Jordan (D-Tex.), who advised the committee that the United States had come too far for her to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution. However, to me the most unforgettable Watergate lawmaker was House member Earl Landgrebe, a three-term Republican from Valparaiso, Ind. Landgrebes support for President Richard Nixon throughout the Watergate scandal set a standard for slavish loyalty that remains unmatched to this day.\n\nBut now, drumroll please \n\nThey dont make em like that anymore. Or so I thought, until House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) arrived on the scene. The chief difference between these two Republicans is that Landgrebe never got the chance to wield a gavel. In the post-Watergate elections, voters in Indianas 2nd District decided it was time to bring him home for good. Nunes may not be an exact genetic copy of Landgrebe, but his behavior puts him in the same pedigree.\n\nWhats sad is that while Nunes may out-Landgrebe Landgrebe, there seems to be no Republican out there who is even close to Bakers level of country over party.\n\nThe Miami Herald has a few comments on Nunes.\n\nAmazing. All this hot air about blocking Americas enemies with border walls and travel bans, and it turns out that the enemies of the American people have been right here all along. Simply put, U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes is acting like a double agent, and not a very good one at that.\n\nI was thinking that all Nunes skulking around was CIA-envy, but maybe thats not the brand of trenchcoat the chairman of the House intelligence committee is looking to wear.\n\nHe cannot be trusted to lead what should be an impartial investigation into ties between Russia and President Donald Trump and his administration. And if he wont step aside, then he needs to be pushed by his colleagues. His transgressions are that serious. Unfortunately, he seems to enjoy being the star of the intrigue hes created too much to exit the stage.\n\nBeing a Republican means never having to say youre sorry.\n\nRobert Redford wasnt actually one of the journalists who uncovered Watergate, but then, he also didnt spend years making goo goo eyes at George W. Bush.\n\nThis year marks the 45th anniversary of the Watergate scandal. Because of my role in the film, some have asked me about the similarities between our situations in 1972 and 2017. There are many. The biggest one is the importance of a free and independent media in defending our democracy. When President Trump speaks of being in a running war with the media, calls them among the most dishonest human beings on Earth and tweets that theyre the enemy of the American people, his language takes the Nixon administrations false accusations of shoddy and shabby journalism to new and dangerous heights. Sound and accurate journalism defends our democracy. Its one of the most effective weapons we have to restrain the power-hungry. I always said that All the Presidents Men was a violent movie. No shots were fired, but words were used as weapons.\n\nGo read the rest. You know you want to anyway.\n\nAnne Applebaum says the only thing odd about the secret Russian involvement in the US election is that it was secret.\n\nOne of Frances presidential candidates, Marine Le Pen of the far right National Front, was in Moscow last week as her party is openly seeking Russian financial support. In 2014, her party received a 9 million euro loan from a Russian-Czech bank, and in 2016, it was revealed this week, she received an additional 3 million euros from another Russian bank; a political fund run by her father, the former party chairman, also received 2 million euros from a Russian-backed fund based in Cyprus. Le Pens agenda  anti-NATO, anti-European Union  is perfectly aligned with that of Moscow, which seeks to destroy the European and transatlantic institutions that curb Russian influence. That support hasnt damaged her standing with her voters: At a major Le Pen rally in Lille, France, a few days ago, Putins name was cheered.\n\nTo be fair, Putins name is often cheered at Trump rallies. Usually by Trump. But a pro-Russian, anti-NATO role can be played openly in France. Thats why Le Pen didnt have to hire Paul Manafort.\n\nDana Milbank explains how _____ can instantly ______ just by _____.\n\nPolitico this week reported on an innovative new policy from the Trump administration: An Energy Department official had directed staff not to use the phrases climate change, emissions reduction or Paris Agreement in written memos, briefings or other written communication.  Banning climate change could be the beginning of an elegant solution for this floundering young administration: If you cant eliminate a problem, eliminate any mention of the problem. And Trump has already amassed a substantial list of people and things he would undoubtedly like to make go away. He could decree no more mention of: Michael Flynn. Immunity deals. Obamacare. Chuck Schumer. The Freedom Caucus. Democrats. The Congressional Black Caucus. April Ryan. The failing New York Times. Mark Meadows. Jim Jordan. Raul Labrador. Jared Kushners testimony. Ivanka Trumps conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest generally. The Club for Growth. Heritage Action. NBC. ABC. CNN. Paul Ryan. Preet Bharara. Snoop Dogg. The Russia probe. The FBI. The CIA. Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee. Polls. The deficit. Judges. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Congress.\n\nBasically anything but discussions of golf and terms for locker room talk. Thats still just fine.\n\nLeonard Pitts has an open letter to Bill OReilly this week. But rather than excerpt it, Im just going to say that if you like Pitts (and you should) and you hate OReilly (which oh come on) then you should go read it. Right to the end.\n\nMichael Gerson's piece actually ran a couple of days ago, but its worth hitting again.\n\nSince the rise of the tea party, there have been perhaps 30 members of the House  the Freedom Caucus  who have been consistently unwilling to vote for center-right policy because their anti-government convictions are unappeasable. Incited and abetted by conservative media, they made then-Speaker John Boehners (R-Ohio) life a living hell, and have greeted Ryan (Wis.) with sharpened pitchforks. So a party at the peak of its political fortunes is utterly paralyzed. A caucus in control of everything is itself uncontrollable.\n\nAll I ask is that they stay paralyzed until, say, November 2018. Theyve wasted two months without getting significant legislation through. Is it really too much to hope that a debate on tax reform could absorb the next twenty?\n\nThe GOP needed a large and capable leader who could either unite the whole party (at least temporarily) with a bold, conservative vision, or peel off some centrist Democratic support with innovative policy. They needed an above-average president. What they got is unimaginably distant from any of these goals. They got a leader who is empty  devoid of even moderately detailed preferences and incapable of using policy details in the course of political persuasion. Republicans got a leader who is impatient and easily distracted  by cable news on the Russian scandal or by Arnold Schwarzeneggers TV ratings. The content and consequences of his tweets are bad enough; worse is the disordered personality traits they reveal  vindictiveness, shallowness and lack of discipline. Trump spent a total of 18 days on his health-care bill before demanding a vote. And he made no speech to the nation to advance his ideas  as every other recent president would have done.\n\nThe dawn approaches. Somewhere in the distance is the sound of a tweet. Could it be Donald Trump attacking the Freedom Caucus again? Lets hope so.\n\n1 Year, 7 months, 4 days until the 2018 election. Thats 83 more weeks.\n\nOh, and Arrrrghhhh.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/2/1649455/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up#read-more", "date": "2017/4/2"}, {"text": "A lot more people now have health insurance than before the Affordable Care Act was enacted.

Anything less than that is not merely disappointing, but disgraceful.\n\nFor seven years weve been fighting to save the splintered, deeply flawed system we already have because the Obama health care reforms created a system in which more people are covered than before and many who were previously covered have better coverage now. There are many problems, but the biggest is that millions still live without coverage of any kind. Even modest tweaking of some of the ACAs flaws is out of the question as long as we are hamstrung by the political domination of the current controllers of all branches of the federal government. But the obstacles should not stop progressives from trying anywayat both the federal and state levels.\n\nWe should make certain in this process that whatever gradual improvements we propose now 1) will actually be improvements, and 2) not create additional impediments to reaching genuine universality.\n\nIf it were up to me, Id opt for something close to the French system with elements of Cubas. You can clearly see why I am not asked to suggest policy strategy for the Democratic Party. Democratic socialism + authoritarian socialism all in one package? Ye gods, where is the duct tape? So, nothing overtly franais or cubana. But whatever system makeover is eventually proposed, it ought to be a dealbreaker if it doesnt do what those two foreign systems do: cover everybody.\n\nThis past week, reports Deidre Fulton at CommonDreams, weve seen some reasons to be optimistic. Not only did repeal-and-replace turn into a high-speed collision with reality for the Republicans, but it showed in the outpouring of citizen objections that there is room to move the health care debate in a leftward direction:\n\nOne bright spot was Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) announcement over the weekend that he will soon introduce a Medicare-for-All bill in the U.S. Senate. Other promising signals included: 1. To much fanfare, a California lawmaker on Thursday unveiled details about Senate Bill 562, or the \"Healthy California Act,\" a single-payer proposal to create universal health coverage (including inpatient, outpatient, emergency care, dental, vision, mental health, and nursing home care) for every California resident. \"With Republicans' failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Californians really get what is at stake with their healthcare,\" said Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara, who is co-sponsoring the bill along with state Sen. Toni G. Atkins (D-San Diego). \"We have the chance to make universal healthcare a reality now. It's time to talk about how we get to healthcare for all that covers more and costs less.\" [...] 2. The Huffington Post reports that \"[t]he push to implement a 'Medicare-for-All'-type system in New York state just took a significant step forward Wednesday.\" [...] 3. Progressive luminary Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced support for single payer on two separate occasions in the last week, first at a town hall meeting last Friday and again when pressed by a reporter on Monday. Warren [...] told MassLive that \"single-payer sure ought to be at the top of the list\" if the country starts from scratch on healthcare reform following this month's American Healthcare Act (AHCA) implosion. [...] 4. Warren isn't the only lawmaker whose support for universal coverage is more forthcoming these days. Vox reported this week: During the last two years of Barack Obama's presidency, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) could only find 62 other House Democrats willing to co-sponsor his single-payer healthcare proposalwhich would expand Medicare to cover every American. But just two months into the new Congress, Conyers's team has already signed up 78 co-sponsors for the exact same single-payer bill. More are expected to come on board in the next two weeks. At this point in the last Congress, only 48 Democratic House members had signed on to the bill.

They will face a hostile word, uniting in opposition to US interests, regardless of their legitimacy. They will need to deal with joblessness, a double-dip recession, and corporate scandals. But most daunting of all, they will need a solution to the Iraq mess. For purposes of this thought experiment lets assume the most probably outcome -- a relatively quick takeover of Baghdad and Basra, 2-6 weeks from now. A restive population, suicide attacks against our forces, a massive army of occupation, unrest in the Arab street, and skyrocketing costs to hold and rebuild Iraq. So what's the solution? I have given this some thought, and am in the process of formulating my \"solution\" (in other words, the best of a series of bad options). But I want to hear what you guys have to say.

Most Americans, though, are much more likely to run for local office, and all Americans are impacted by the decisions of local office holders.\n\nOften, we only hear about city governments when things have gone horribly wrong, like Ferguson, Missouri or Detroit, Michigan. But policies put in place by city and county governments have a major impact on issues on national policy issues.\n\nLarge cities and counties are the ones who act as the vehicle to promote everything from body cameras to nondiscrimination policies in local businesses. As a result, city and county governments can have a big impact on how you live your life.\n\nGreat elected officials in your school board, city government, and county government can significantly improve the life of the residents in that community, no matter who is in the White House.\n\nYour school boards can help set up the kind of education environment your student participates in. Great school boards can make a positive difference; bad school boards? Well, bad school boards can make poor financial decisions, push agendas, or work against the educational goals of children.\n\nAnd, no matter what a governor or president says, your city officers decide where the stop lights go and how to handle policing practices.\n\nI want to run for one of these offices, but I might not know enough. How do I learn?\n\nCity offices can be councils, committees, or even mini-legislatures. School boards can be large or small, divided by wards, districts, or schools in multi-school districts. If you are considering running for any of these offices, the best way to become familiar with them is to attend public meetings.\n\nMeetings of your city government and school boards are open to the public, and you can go and watch how your school board works. You may find that your school board or city council member effectively represents you. However, if you have concerns about the direction of these offices, why not run?\n\nIn many placeseven larger communities, these races can be unchallenged or face a fleet of new comers. In Knox County, Tennessee, the races featured real discussions of issues, but not a lot of money spent or attention.\n\nIf this happens in large county elections, what happens in your local small communities? Youve got it. Around the country, numerous races for city councils and school boards and county officers go unchallenged.\n\nIf you go to your local meetings, you can determine what is happening in your city and county offices, or your school board, and build an idea of why you should run. Frankly, in many areas of the country if you make a habit of going to the school board meeting you have an inside track to becoming a school board member.\n\nDemocratic mayors are one of our most important resources.\n\nIn a letter sent to DNC members, Barbara Moore advocated for the Democratic municipal officials saying: \"Even in places where traditional Democratic voters have been seduced by national Republicans, voters continue to place their trust in local Democrats.\n\nMayors are often the face of that advocacy, and effective mayors present communities with a standard of what local leadership looks like. Mayors of large cities, of course, can help set the tone for our nation, but it is often mayors of small municipalities that have opportunities for transformational moves for their community.\n\nMayors can promote everything from green environmental policies, community transportation options and work to address food deserts.\n\nThink it takes a long time to integrate yourself and make change? Tell that to Rachel Hundley, who moved to Sonoma and three years later finds herself the mayor. Now, shes in a position to make changes about how that community grows, and those impacts matter for every one of the residents.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOften, we dismiss races for school board, city councils, mayoral and county offices as small ball.

Last summer, we had a family meeting, and decided to have no more baby bunnies. Since we try to raise all of our own meat, weve had to learn to butcher. We raise rabbits, chickens, and a couple of pigs for meat. But weve started eating a lot less meat, and, while rabbit is a good lean meat, we like it only rarely now that we actually know each and every animal we eat. Weve decided to eat meat once or twice a week, and so we didnt need to have any more rabbit babies for a while. This decided, we put Maurice, our boy rabbit, in with his favorite girl rabbit, Poofy, the one who never did get pregnant in the three or so years we had her. The other two females (Sylvia and Bonnie) get along well, so they got to room together too. They like to cuddle. Poofy and Maurice had spent those three years trying to be in the same cage. Poofy would chew through her chicken wire and sit by Maurices pen. Wed reinforce her home only to have Maurice chew through his roof support to get out and into her cage. Sometimes they both would get out and have romantic weekends together until we could catch them both. They never left the chicken pasture, and they were fairly easy to catch when they wanted to be caught. Poofy had ample opportunity to get pregnant, but it never took.\n\nKrotor writesWarning to dog owners: a pleasant walk in nature may present a deadly threat to your pet: Thanks to NPR, I just learned something shocking: lethal cyanide bombs are sometimes used on public lands to eliminate coyotes but they can kill your pet dog just as readily. An Idaho teenager noticed something unusual almost completely buried in the ground while he was out walking near his family property with his dog. When he bent down to check it out, the item detonated, covering him and the dog with a fine powder.The boy ended up at the hospital but he survived. Sadly, his dog died. The device is an M44 cyanide device, sometimes called a cyanide gun or cyanide trap. Its primary use is to kill coyotes, foxes, and feral (wild) dogs, to prevent them from harming livestock like sheep and poultry. The device is buried flush with the soil with just the business end of it exposed. That part is smeared with an attractant to lure in the target predators and when they bite or pull at it, the M44 erupts with a lethal dose of cyanide to the animal's face.\n\nold wobbly writesOsprey Inspiration from SF Bay: The first Ospreys of the season have come back to the nest on the old WW II crane.

Science readers know that humans get many of our best ideas from plants and animals, which is partly why we obsess over how bumblebees fly, geckos stick and dolphin echolocate. Maybe we can improve helicopters, adhesives and sonar, if we learn their secrets. Which brings us to the fang blenny, a tiny striped fish with a venom that acts like a powerful pain drug. Researchers are excited that the bite contains a natural pain killer that is chemically similar to a peptide found in humans.

If youre voting for Democrat Jon Ossoff, you probably dont need to be convinced that climate change is real and that we need to reduce our carbon emissions. But what if you have conservative 6th district family or friends who are on the fence about climate change? Maybe theyre getting worried about Georgias increasingly long and scorching summers. Or maybe they were alarmed by last falls wildfires, and the haze and odor that permeated metro-Atlanta. voteclimatega6.com is a handy website that addresses why Georgians should vote climate in the 6th district election. The site is a fast read and easy to digest. Its a high level view of how climate change is already affecting Georgia and its residents. If the candidates have an official position on climate change, its on the website. And if the candidates dont, well, thats noted, too.

This ranked as the second warmest February in the 123-year period of record. Nearly one-quarter of the U.S. was record warm in February. Only February 1954 was warmer for the nation at 41.4F. Between December 2016 and February 2017, the average temperature across the contiguous U.S. was 35.9F, 3.7F above average, the sixth warmest winter on record. [...] So while the Donald keeps an open mind while pursuing a policy of expanding the exploration and drilling of fossil fuels throughout the country and beyond while ignoring the consensus that climate change exists by 97% of the scientific community, the facts keep mounting up.

After all, the minority Democrats on Smiths House Committee on Science, Space, & Technology published a report this month titled  Much Ado About Nothing, which details Smiths crusade to attempt to undermine and invalidate Tom Karls pause-buster study. (Yet Smith still cant get NOAAs name right !) Although little was said about Karl, yesterdays House Science Committee hearing with Drs. Michael Mann, John Christy, Judith Curry and Roger Pielke Jr. was a quite a circus. Which is exactly why someone whos been through Smiths nonsense, Dr. David Titley, wrote for the Washington Post that scientists should boycott these biased hearings. That would be nice, if that meant that Smith would stop holding them. But since he shows no sign of slowing his inquisition , someone needs to show up to set the record straight and push back on all the denial packed into the hearing like so many clowns in a tiny car. And thats exactly what Dr. Mann did, successfully walking the tight-rope between correcting other witnesses and coming off as a jerk.\n\nClimateDenierRoundup writesLamar Smith and Big Tobacco Present: Shill Advisory Boards and DisHONEST Science Act: Wednesday was a busy one for everyones favorite fossil fuel-funded science inquisitor. Not only did Lamar Smith make an embarrassment of himself and the Science Committee by literally attacking Science Magazine , but afterward also went after EPA science with a pair of bills straight from the tobacco industrys playbook . The first is called the HONEST act, because doublespeak is Lamar Smiths native language. The bill claims to increase the transparency and accountability of EPA science by mandating studies be easily replicable and their data made fully public. But an EPA transition team member let slip to Emily Atkins how thoroughly it would prevent regulation: Almost everything that has been done in the last 10, 11, 12 years would not pass the standards. By mandating the EPA only use studies with public data that can be reproduced by outside researchers, it essentially prevents the agency from using any study it doesnt conduct itself. Because it would need to get permission to release private data, the EPA wouldnt be allowed to use studies that, for example, track cancer rates around polluted sites.\n\nPakalolo writesDisconcerting - New Study Finds Greenland's Ice Caps Have Crossed The Tipping Point: The Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht - IMAU , in a new finding reveals that the natural capacity of Greenland ice caps to contain and refreeze meltwater broke down around 1997, when  due to rising temperatures - the thick snow cover on the ice caps became completely saturated with refrozen meltwater. Since then, the rate of mass loss of the ice caps has accelerated and has become practically irreversible, the authors write in the article published today in Nature Communications. [...] The Researchers note that Greenlands ice caps represent the largest ice masses on earth apart from the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The ice caps around Greenlands edges may lose one fifth to one quarter of their volume by the year 2100, which would add an extra 1  inches of sea level rise.\n\nPakalolo writesPutin doesn't think Trump is silly on climate rollback. Mysterious Oil Co gets ok to drill in Crimea: Irina Slav, a writer for Oil Price has an intriguing piece revealing a new company that has been awarded an oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea shelf. The news about this new company, Novye Proekty, was published by Kommersant. The Crimean sea shelf is named the Glubokaya block. It holds, per Irina Slav, reserves estimated in 2011 at 8.3 million tons of crude and 1.4 billion cu m of natural gas. She notes that the Crimean shelf with its treasure trove of fossil fuels is one of the reasons for the annexationof Crimea by Vladimir Putin. Slav writes: Whats more interesting, however, is that Novye Proekty is a private company, and private companies are not allowed to explore for oil and gas in the Crimean shelf, TASS notes. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev opened the door for license-issuing for Crimea last year, but only state-owned companies were to be allowed through it. Yet, here this company is, awarded a 30-year license with the obligation to drill a well within the next eight years.\n\npoopdogcomedy writesPA-Gov: Mini-Trump Scott Wagner (R) Actually Thinks Our 'Warm Bodies' May Be Causing Climate Change: The stupid, it burns: Republican 2018 guv candidate Scott Wagner keynoted an event for natural gas advocates in Harrisburg on Tuesday, offering an ... ah ... novel explanation for the scientific phenomenon known as climate change: I haven't been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year-you know the rotation of the earth, Wagner, a York County state senator, said, according to StateImpact Pennsylvania.

The demonstration will start at noon. As chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Nunes has recently been at the center of a political firestorm in Washington, DC over his ability to objectively investigate a probe of Moscow's meddling in the 2016 campaign and the murky web of contacts between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. Nunes was a member of the executive committee leading President-elect Trump's Presidential Transition Team. Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director of Restore the Delta said, Most Americans are just learning how easily misstatements roll off Congressman Nunes' tongue. But this is nothing new to Californians. For years, Nunes has made misstatements about the causes of California drought. He has pitted Fresno-area farmers against commercial fishermen by failing to admit that Northern California's economy is predicated on a healthy San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary.

But look at what consumers arent spending money on. Household utilities spending dropped 2% in February, and 2017 household utilities spending is down about 7% from fourth-quarter levels.

Three and a half to four percent of global warming emissions if you believe Wiki, and I do. Lately imports and the loss of jobs associated with imports have been a topic politically. According to an AP story I read at VOA, global trade is also bad for the environment. They figure an additional quarter million deaths just from the pollution of the maritime shipping. Producing more goods locally would change where deaths occur and potentially reduce overall deaths  if local emissions rules are tighter. Bringing back manufacturing to the United States, as President Donald Trump and politicians from both parties want, would bring more air pollution deaths to the U.S., but reduce deaths worldwide because pollution laws are stricter, Davis and others said.\n\nWILDERNESS, NATIONAL FORESTS AND PARKS & OTHER PUBLIC LANDS\n\nWalter Einenkel writesRemember when Rep.

Chaffetz stand up on two feet and backpedal, saying he was withdrawing the bill, having listened to his constituents. It seemed too good to be true, since Rep. Jason Chaffetz is a truly craven person. Well, it seems it was too good to be true. [...] If you cannot read that screengrab, you can look for yourself and see what a giant slap in the face of the American people actually looks like in practice. Rep. Chaffetz told the public he was withdrawing his bill on February 2. Eight days later the bill was referred to a subcommittee.

Those officers initially arrested Aguilar on drug charges, according to Roth. He pleaded guilty, and spent about two weeks in county jail for the offense. After the two weeks were up, he would have been free to go. But ICE thought he was undocumented, and wanted to deport him. The officers kept him in the county jail so agents with ICEs Chicago field office could take him into custody. According to the complaint, they picked him up on or around March 7 and moved him to the Boone County Jail in Burlington, Kentucky, where they contract out space to detain people facing deportation.\n\nAccording to his attorney Charles Roth, when Aguilar tried to tell immigration officials that he was a U.S. citizen, basically they said, Tell it to the judge. But, they didnt let him see one, notes the Daily Beast.\n\nWhen the complaint was filed, ICE hadnt yet filed whats called a Notice to Appear in immigration court against Aguilar. That notice would be the document officially charging him, and would require him to go to court. ICE Chicago did not obtain a judicial warrant to arrest Plaintiff; has not provided a sworn, particularized statement of probable cause; has not promptly brought him before a detached and neutral judicial officer for a probable cause hearing; or has not brought him before a judge to understand the charges against him and receive important advisals regarding his due process rights, amongst other procedural protections, the complaint says.

Thats right  in the 1970s, both the war criminal Pinochet in Chile (below) and the war criminal generals in Argentinas Dirty War (both backed secretly and shamefully by Kissinger-era America) used to round up anyone critical of their governments, anybody pushing for positive change (all of which were telltale signs of a Communist), load them in a helicopter, and dump them in the ocean, thus leading to tens of thousands of desaparecidos  disappeared people. So this is what these Trumpenkriegers would love to see, what they fantasize President Trump should and maybe someday will do  round up all of us Communists who disagree with his Muslim travel ban, his deportations and wall, his war on the environment and robbery of the poor, etc., and drop us off a helicopter to drown in the Pacific or Atlantic.

Helene Keeley, Rep. Paul Baumbach, Rep. John Kowalko, and Rep. John Viola, as well as Delawares lead Public Defender, Brendan ONeill, announced the filing of HB110 this afternoon, which is bipartisan legislation that would legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana in Delaware under similar regulations to those governing liquor stores. [...] The bill still prohibits driving while stoned, and it prohibits the purchase of marijuana by anyone under the age of 21. The bill would also prohibit the consumption and/or smoking of marijuana in public, and it would also still prohibit the growing of personal marijuana plants at home. [...] [Sen. Henry said] The prohibition of marijuana has grown our prison population to unsafe levels; it has derailed thousands of lives and wasted immeasurable potential; and it has perpetuated unacceptable racial disparities in our criminal justice system  all over a drug safer than alcohol, less addictive than tobacco, and easier for our kids to get their hands on than either. This policy has wreaked havoc on our communities, and its time for us to reverse course. A poll conducted by the University of Delaware last year found that more than 60 percent of Delawareans support full legalization of marijuana. But Gov. John Carney has his doubts.\n\nTom von Alten at fortboise of Idaho writesStop me if you've heard this one:\n\nJeanette works as a volunteer at the Boise Public Library! once a week, handling the considerable weight of donations it receives, and turning them into good things like tens of thousands of dollars to stock branch libraries and such.

Pete Souza provided exactly that insight during his first public speech about his work since serving as the chief White House photographer during President Barack Obamas two terms in office. Souza spoke Tuesday afternoon at Ohio Universitys Schuneman Symposium for Photojournalism & News Media. The Baker Center Theater was so full for his talk that organizers set up an additional 200 chairs in the Baker Ballroom with a live-stream of the speech, and most of those seats were filled as well. I looked at my job as trying to show him as president and as a human being, Souza said. You guys all know the play, Hamilton, and the song, In the Room Where It Happens. I was always in the room where it happened. I took that seriously. I tried to do it as a documentary photographer with aesthetics in mind. [...] Another photo shows just President Obamas hand pointing out a line of edits he made in a speech he gave to a joint session of U.S. Congress on the importance of getting the Affordable Care Act passed. Souza said Obama would spend hours with his speech-writers poring over every word and explaining his goals and thinking. Souza choked up during several reflections on his time with the president.

Assistant House Minority Leader Alec Garnett, D-Denver, said the alliance voted Tuesday night to pull its support from House Bill 1279, which would require a homeowners association gather a simple majority of votes from unit owners in order to pursue litigation for defects. [...] This latest compromise between Democratic Rep. Alec Garnett and GOP Reps. Cole Wist and Lori Saine was hailed by House Speaker Crisanta Duran as the long-awaited solution to a problem that the legislature has been unable to solve for years running. The Build Our Homes Right coalition, which has consistently fought attempts to fully take away homeowners rights to sue while working in good faith, were prepared to accept it as a compromise that didnt go too far against homeowners. But just as weve seen in years past, nothing short of shunting all construction defect claims into arbitration will suffice for the builder industry.\n\ncountrycat at Left in Alabama writes Only Two Alabama Representatives Vote To Protect Internet Privacy:\n\nTheres no small amount of cognitive dissonance involved in typing these four words: Good job, Mo Brooks. And yet, Brooks (CD-05) joined with Rep. Terri Sewell (CD-07) yesterday to vote NO on a GOP anti-privacy, pro-telecom bill. Both the Senate and House voted to roll back landmark Obama-era Internet privacy regulations. (Bill numbers were SJ 34 and HB 230) The House vote was close: 205-210. Alabamas other representatives could have stopped it, but chose instead to protect big telecom & big campaign contributions. Essentially, theyve given huge telecom companies carte blanche to collect your Internet browsing history and preferences, package that data, and sell it to advertisers. Campers, be careful what search terms you use because its about to be part of your consumer profile. [...] Oddly, neither Representative has released a statement about the bill or even mentioned it in passing on their social media feeds. Brooks is busy displaying his tail feathers over his bill to repeal Obamacare (hey, one step forward and a giant jump backwards), while Sewell is busy stalking Trumps tax returns and Rep.

Future.org writesLegislation keeping domestic abusers from accessing guns needs your support:\n\n[...] Research on Rhode Island domestic abuse restraining orders released in 2015 by Everytown for Gun Safety showed that even in cases where an abuser presented a firearms threat, courts only ordered abusers to turn in their guns in less than 13 percent of cases. As a consequence, 325 abusers here in RI who appeared to have access to firearms were not ordered to surrender them  even though that same research showed that most of them were already prohibited from possessing guns by federal law. This leaves victims living in constant fear that their abuser maybe be armed and dangerous. That is unacceptable. The good news is that important legislation that would help protect Rhode Island domestic abuse victims has been introduced in the General Assembly. Representative Teresa Tanzi (Democrat, District 34, Narragansett, South Kingstown) and Senator Harold Metts (Democrat, District 6, Providence) have introduced bills H5510/S405 which would make sure that dangerous domestic abusers are ordered to turn their guns in for as long as they cant legally have them. The bill would bring Rhode Island law in line with federal law by prohibiting gun possession by abusers convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. The bill would also bring Rhode Island law in line with federal law and that of 25 other states by prohibiting gun possession for domestic abusers that are subject to final domestic abuse protective orders. Finally, the bill would require all prohibited domestic abusers to turn in guns they already own. Fifteen statesincluding Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Yorkhave already enacted legislation like this to protect victims of domestic abuse. Given the overwhelming evidence that victims are safer if their abusers dont have guns, our state is failing.

The effort to muzzle Yates, which many people believe leads back to shadowy Trump advisor Steve Bannon, blew up in the faces of everyone involved. Nunes duplicity was revealed. The White House officials who reportedly gave Nunes the goodies he then relayed at his bombshell press conference were left dodging reporter inquiries. By Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer flamed out in front of the press corps like a meteor entering the earths atmosphere. After youve been dabbling in alternate universes too long, the earths gravitational pull can be a real bitch.\n\nTeam Trump may have managed to navigate the politics of 2016, but the maze of the vast federal bureaucracy Steve Bannon seeks to deconstruct might be the ultimate undoing of Trumps White House. Remember, Obama aidesrealizing the extent of Russian interference and likely fretting for our countrys futureurgently worked to spread the intelligence throughout that vast federal bureaucracy in advance of Trumps takeover. After years in the White House, Obama aidesmany of whom had more governing experience in their pinky fingers than Trumps entire top White House stafflikely had the competence to layer those intelligence nuggets in ways Bannon & Co. will never be able to comprehend. At least, heres hoping.\n\nBut for now, we are left with the gaping absence of input from Yates, a totally compromised House Intelligence investigation, and a House Speaker who refuses to do his patriotic duty despite working toward legislative goals hes shown no capacity to achieve.\n\nKeep in mind the supposed bargain Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have made all along: Theyd look the other way on Trumps total lack of fitness for office in service of repealing Obamacare, cutting taxes for the rich, overhauling the budget, etc. Now that the Republican caucus has proven just how unlikely it is to make good on the legislative end of that bargain, you might think Paul Ryan would elevate country over failing partisanship.\n\nBut to borrow a quote from Ryan himself: No and no. That lofty millisecond of an answer was what he uttered this week when asked whether Nunes should recuse himself from the Russian investigation and if he knew who Nunes deep throat was.\n\nRyans continued commitment to blissful ignorance as the body he leads crumbles around him brought me back to the question of whether our institutions can insulate us from the perils of the Trump regime. Its a question I first started pondering late last year after reading Russian journalist Masha Gessens third rule for surviving an autocracy: Institutions will not save you.\n\nWhats become clear over the last several months is that our institutions might save us, but they are only as good as the people serving within them. As Europe historian and On Tyranny author Timothy Snyder told NPR: \"Our institutions don't defend themselves. The institutions only make it when people themselves do the little things that they can do as individuals.\"\n\nIn ten short days as acting Attorney General, Sally Yates gave her patriotic best: Informing White House officials that one of their owna powerful Trump loyalistwas making liars of them; and declining to use the institution of justice she briefly led to provide cover for an order she deemed wholly unjust.\n\nYates demonstrated exactly the type of integrity that could save our republic at this perilous moment in history.\n\nBy comparison, Paul Ryan has become a de facto traitor to our democratic ideals by undermining the institution under his charge that is designed to protect them. Americans seem to know thathes now polling below Trump as the most unpopular politician in the country at 21 percent.

DeVos either doesnt understand or refuses to acknowledge that if the United States is going to educate all of its kids, not just the lucky ones, we need to think about education as a public good, not a series of fragmented, privatized pieces. DeVos drew a comparison that tells us a lot about how she sees educationand what she doesnt want to see:\n\nHow many of you got here today in an Uber, or Lyft, or another ridesharing service? Did you choose that because it was more convenient than hoping a taxi would drive by? Even if you didnt use a ridesharing service, Im sure most of you at least have the app on your phone. Just as the traditional taxi system revolted against ridesharing, so too does the education establishment feel threatened by the rise of school choice. In both cases, the entrenched status quo has resisted models that empower individuals.\n\nNotice whats missing there? Any form of transportation that isnt for profit. Call it  public transit. DeVos sees education as each of us hiring a private service and getting into an individual car to get where were going. That may work on an individual level for a billionaire like DeVosher parents had no problem paying for her to go to private school and she had no problem paying for her kids to do the samebut it doesnt work for the United States as a whole, and it certainly doesnt work on the level of government funding Donald Trump, DeVos, and other Republicans envision for education.\n\nThis is a vision of education that would leave millions of kids out in the cold, and its coming from the person in charge of federal public education.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/30/1648769/-Betsy-DeVos-compares-education-to-Uber-or-Lyft-but-it-s-what-s-missing-that-s-most-disturbing#view-story", "date": "2017/3/30"}, {"text": "Former Obama administration officials Gene Sperling and Chris Jennings have a primer on the various ways the Trump regime can work to undermine Obamacare and how to determine if he's laying the groundwork for destroying it from within. The problem for Trump, they argue, is that if he is \"seen as purposely seeking to destroy the ACA to try to make his claims come true, he will destroy the trust he needs for any chance at future bipartisan legislation.\" So he's going to need to be sneaky about it. If that's possible.\n\nFirst off, they say to watch for what the regime does with the pending lawsuit House Republicans brought several years ago to halt federal subsidies to insurers to help lower-income individuals pay their deductibles and copays. Two powerful House Republicans now say that Congress should appropriate the money for those subsidies. The easier movesince passing anything to make Obamacare work is going to require Democratic votesfor House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump would be to withdraw the suit. So Sperling and Jennings say that the \"critical test for the president will be whether he can work with the Congress to move to withdraw the House's lawsuit and ensure ongoing funding for cost-sharing, and do so before the court-imposed deadline of May 22.\n\nThe second big question is whether Trump will enforce the individual mandate, the core of the law which requires everyone who can afford it to have insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nTrumps first executive order, though, asked for all parts of his government to minimize the burdens of the ACA, which many feared could result in a refusal to enforce the individual mandate. [] So while Trumps executive order did not by itself weaken the mandate, it did send a message that the tax penalties used to incentivize mandatory health coverage are not likely to be strictly enforced. The second major test to determine whether the President is choosing sabotage over governing will be if he directs his administration not to enforce the current individual-mandate provisions within the ACA.\n\nRelated to the mandate, the next thing to watch for is whether the Trump regime will make any attempt to encourage enrollment, or whether he'll discourage it. We saw the first attempt at discouraging enrollment when the regime tried to cancel the advertising the Obama administration already had in place for the last few weeks of open enrollment. \"If the Trump administration declines to match the effort and resources the Obama administration dedicated (and, instead, substantially reduces them), it will be a clear indication that it is choosing sabotage over governing.\"", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/1/1648795/-All-the-ways-Trump-can-sabotage-a-totally-not-exploding-Obamacare#read-more", "date": "2017/4/1"}, {"text": "Jon Ossoff\n\nRepublicans hold the White House, both houses of Congress, and most governors mansions and state legislatures.

If the bill becomes law, Connecticut would assign its seven Electoral College votes to the national popular vote winner regardless of who wins the state, but only if enough states with a majority of electoral votes also agree to do so. Thus far, 10 states and Washington, D.C., have joined the compact, but their 165 electoral votes are well short of the 270 needed for it to take effect.\n\nThanks to Lt. Gov. Nancy Wymans ability to breaking ties in the evenly divided Senate in their favor, Democrats completely control state government in Connecticut. Its consequently one of just three Democratic-run states, along with Delaware and Oregon, that hasnt joined the compact yet, but if the party can hold together, that might soon change.\n\nVoter Registration\n\n Oregon: Oregons Democratic-controlled state Senate approved a bill that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote, as long as theyll turn 18 by the next election. Since Oregon automatically registers any eligible voter when they obtain a drivers license unless they opt out, lowering the registration age to 16, an age when many people often first get a license, could mean more young people registering. With Democrats in power in the governors office and state House, this bill stands a good chance of becoming law.\n\nVoter Suppression\n\n Arkansas: As expected, GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a new voter ID law that will require voters show some form of photo ID when they go to vote. Those who lack the appropriate ID can sign an affidavit swearing to their identity, allowing them to cast a provisional ballot, but the new provision could nonetheless cause voter confusion and intimidation.\n\nThis law comes after the state Supreme Court struck down the GOPs 2013 voter ID bill in 2014, but Republicans believe this new measure will survive judicial review. Four of the courts seven justices who heard the previous case are no longer on the bench, while the remaining three seemed open to a voter ID law if it were to pass the legislature with two-thirds supermajorities, which is precisely what happened. Just to be extra certain, Republican legislators previously voted to put a state constitutional amendment on voter ID up for a 2018 ballot referendum.\n\n Georgia: Georgias heavily Republican state legislature has passed an exact match voter registration law that would reject registration applications if literally any letter, character, or symbol in the information the voter provides does not perfectly match data from state and federal databases. If theres a discrepancy, voters can cast a provisional ballot on condition of clearing up the differences shortly thereafter, while their original voter registration applications could be rejected after two years if they dont.\n\nWhile Republicans claim this measure is needed to fight fraud, these databases are infamously inaccurate, especially for black and Latino voters, whose names are more likely to contain symbols that trip up the databases. What makes this bill especially egregious is that Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp just settled a lawsuit in February over using an exact-match system that led to the rejection of over 40,000 applications from predominantly black citizens ahead of the 2016 elections. With GOP Gov. Nathan Deal likely to sign this bill, a new lawsuit will be the only recourse for voting rights proponents.\n\n New Hampshire: Republican state senators passed a bill on a party-line vote that would tighten voter residency requirements, likely as part of a GOP ploy to make it harder for Democratic-leaning demographics such as college students to vote. The proposed change would require that voters show proof that they intend to live in the state long term, even though past court rulings make such restrictions legally dubious. With Republicans holding every lever of government in the Granite State, this bill will likely become law.\n\n Texas: The Republican-majority state Senate has passed a proposal over Democratic objections that would make permanent a court-ordered change to its voter ID law. After a federal court struck down the GOPs strict voter ID provision in 2016, it required Republican legislators to allow voters to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity if they had a reasonable impediment to obtaining an ID. This new bill makes that requirement permanent, but it also imposes stricter penalties for those who submit false information.\n\nRepublicans dominate Texas politics and could easily pass this bill into law. If they do so, voting rights advocates contend that it could still result in voter confusion and intimidation. Meanwhile, litigation over the existing voter ID law remains ongoing over whether Republicans passed the original measure with an intent to discriminate against black and Latino voters, which could be grounds for throwing out the voter ID requirement entirely.\n\nBallot Measures\n\n Arizona: The Republicans who run Arizonas state government recently passed a law to make it harder for progressives to put initiatives on the ballot by banning campaigns from paying petition circulators on a per-signature basis. Now the GOPs pushing even further, with a new bill that would subject petitions to strict compliance instead of substantial compliance when theyre reviewed by election officials. What that change means is that signatures could get thrown outand thus, an initiative knocked off the ballotsimply for mere clerical errors even if such small errors dont obfuscate any signers intent.\n\nRedistricting\n\n Virginia: On Friday, a state circuit court rejected a challenge to 11 of Virginias 140 state legislative districts that had argued that legislators violated the state constitutions requirement that districts be compact during redistricting in 2011. This challenge attacked districts in both the Democratic-drawn state Senate and Republican-drawn state House, but given the much stronger degree of gerrymandering in the lower chamber, its possible that Democrats had much more to gain from a plaintiff victory.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the plaintiffs, from the redistricting reform group OneVirginia2021, will appeal, but given the conservative lean of the state Supreme Court, their chances of success would be doubtful. A separate federal lawsuit targeting Republican racial gerrymandering in the state House is still in progress, however, after plaintiffs in that case scored a key victory before the United States Supreme Court in early March.\n\nFelony Disenfranchisement\n\n Nebraska: Senators in Nebraskas unicameral state legislature gave their initial approval to a bill that would remove the two-year waiting period for those with felony convictions to regain their voting rights following the completion of their sentences. The bill passed by 28 to eight in the Republican-dominated chamber, but unless it gains more support on final passage, thats short of the 30 votes needed to override a potential veto from GOP Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has not yet indicated if he supports the measure.\n\nNebraska is one of just 12 states that currently restricts voting rights even after a person has completely served out a sentence. While it disenfranchises just one percent of its overall population, that number is a far higher six percent among the states small African-American population.

Capretta/RCP:\n\nThe GOP Should Regroup and Approach Democrats on Health Care At this point, it will be difficult to get any congressional Democrats to cooperate on health care. They sense, correctly, that Republicans may not be able to agree on a workable plan, so the most likely scenario at this point is a continuation of the ACA status quo, with perhaps minor changes. That calculus will only change if the GOP gets its act together and comes forward with a revised and more viable plan. Such a plan need not be endorsed by all Republicans, or even passed in the House or Senate. It just needs to be a credible starting point that would make it clear to Democrats that the GOP has a plan that might actually pass and would work. To produce such a plan, Republicans need to adjust their thinking. To begin with, the party should accept as a premise that everyone in the United States should be enrolled in health insurance that pays for major medical expenses. A plan that results in an increase of 15, 20, or 25 million uninsured Americans is not acceptable and would result in a political backlash. The goal should be to produce a plan that covers even more people than the ACA, within a framework of a functioning market that relies less on federal control than the ACA. To get there, the AHCA will need to be changed in many different ways, including the following:\n\nSome pretty good suggestions follow.\n\nx Dems' fundraising has exploded since Trump took office.\n\n\n\nSens.

And such protections are popular with Americans on both sides of the political spectrum. It would be unpopular to attack these laws directly, but you can go after the way the EPA administers those laws, says Yogin Kothari from the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The result of each bill will be the sameworse science at EPA and less public health protections for American citizens, says Eddie Bernice Johnson, ranking Democrat member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. If these bills become law, the ultimate result will be more sick Americans and more dead Americans.\n\nGene Sperling and Chris Jennings/Atlantic:\n\nSix Ways to Tell If Trump Is Sabotaging Obamacare The president appears to be rooting for the Affordable Care Act to fail. Heres a guide to determine whether hes laying the groundwork. Democrats and most health-care experts agree with the Congressional Budget Office and S&P that the ACA is mostly stableand as The New York Times Margot Sanger-Katz recently put it, Obamacare is not on the verge of explosion. Yet as The Washington Posts Greg Sargent wrote Tuesday, some Republicansbeyond Trumpare worried about the optics of helping the ACA succeed. Concerned that any good governance would be a concession that the law can be made to work if Republican officials want to participate in making that happen, they are considering actions that would actually undermine the narrative that the law is not inherently or inevitably destined to implode. Here are six non-legislative markers to watch to judge whether Trump is doing everything in his power to ensure that what Paul Ryan recently called the the law of the land will work as well as possible, or whether he chooses the cynical and even vindictive path of putting the health care of millions at risk to sabotage the ACA.\n\nx Schiff statement after viewing intel docs: \"Nothing I could see today warranted a departure from the normal review procedures.\" pic.twitter.com/YsmKM1xs61  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 31, 2017\n\nFrancis Wilkinson/Bloomberg:\n\nThe Costs of Southern Gun Culture It's difficult to do a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of American gun culture. It fuels a multibillion-dollar industry employing around 142,000, and it kills more than 30,000 and injures an additional 70,000 annually. A new study by researchers at Stanford University tries to come to grips with one of the less frequently mentioned costs of gun culture -- the hospitalization expenses resulting from firearm injuries. The study tracked a total of 267,265 patients who were admitted to a hospital for firearm-related injuries from 2006 through 2014. Costs for initial inpatient hospitalization were about $730 million annually, or a total of $6.6 billion in constant 2014 dollars. Much of that expense landed on the public in the form of Medicaid, Medicare or unreimbursed expenses that the health-care system disperses among consumers. Yet even that is only a partial accounting.\n\nRich Lowry/Politico:\n\nThe Crisis of Trumpism If things continue to go badly, its easy to see Trump turning to the New York Democrats in his White House. This would entail less emphasis on trade and immigration and fights with the mainstream media, and more emphasis on a nonideological economic boosterism. The loose antecedent for this scenario is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who swept into office in California as a drain-the-swamp reformer after winning a populist crusade, and then recalibrated to accommodate the system after suffering politically damaging setbacks. The range of possible outcomes of the Trump presidency is still wide. Unexpectedly, one of them is that his most die-hard populist supporters will eventually be able to say that Trumpism, like socialism, hasnt failed, its just never been tried.\n\nx I literally defy anyone to watch this video in full and not be smiling like a big idiot by the end!!!  pic.twitter.com/MW54Qr8IIu  Stevosideways (@stevosideways) March 31, 2017\n\nSarah Kliff/Vox:", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/4/1/1649123/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Incompetence-and-Chaos-at-the-White-House#read-more", "date": "2017/4/1"}, {"text": "Aaron Morrison at Mic writesProtest groups to unite as \"The Majority\" for massive actions across the country on May 1:\n\nProtest groups to unite as The Majority for massive actions across the country on May 1\n\nActivist groups are uniting as a broader coalition theyve dubbed The Majority, an idea inspired by the Movement for Black Lives  a collective of organizations in the Black Lives Matter movement  organizers first shared with Mic on Thursday.\n\nMore than 50 partners representing black, Latino, the indigenous, LGBTQ, refugees, immigrants, laborers and the poor will collaborate from April 4 through May 1, International Workers Day, when theyll launch massive protests across the country.\n\nThe action will go beyond moments of outrage, beyond narrow concepts of sanctuary, and beyond barriers between communities that have much at stake and so much in common, The Majority states on its BeyondtheMoment.org website, which officially launches Thursday.

For years, the state assisted low-income women in paying for family planning through a Medicaid program called Extended Womens Health Servicesa program funded by both the federal and state government. But now, a new law rejects $8.3 million in federal funds to the womens health program, which means the state can now block all organizations in the state that provide abortions, including hospitals.\n\nOther states, including Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi and Indiana, have tried to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid funds before, but courts have said that would violate a federal law that gives patients the right to choose their health care providers. Missouri hopes to get around that by rejecting the federal money. The rule has not been challenged in court. Missouri's Medicaid program for women's health services currently serves nearly 70,000 low-income patients. To make up for the lost federal funds, the state is increasing its own funding of women's health services for low-income residents. Under the new measure, Missouri will spend $8.3 million to create its own program in place of the federal program it has opted out of.\n\nMany hospitals and other organizations will find their services impacted under the law. As a way of establishing eligibility for funds, the state government sent letters to five hundred different hospitals, clinics and service providers whom have the qualifications to perform abortions requiring them to attest that they do not perform abortion services. If they do not sign the forms, they will no longer be eligible for state funds for womens health services. And, as is commonplace with similar restrictive measures in other states, this law does not include an exception for organizations that provide abortions to save the mothers life.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/31/1649125/-Missouri-says-no-to-federal-money-so-it-can-say-yes-to-restricting-abortion#read-more", "date": "2017/3/31"}, {"text": "You can see a larger version of this graphic by clicking here.\n\nIn a lengthy article by President Barack Obama published in the January 9, 2017, edition of Science magazine, the president pointed out that carbon-dioxide emissions from the U.S. energy sector dropped 9.5 percent from 2008-2015, at the same time the economy grew by 10 percent, and CO 2 emitted per dollar of gross domestic product declined by 18 percent:\n\nThe importance of this trend cannot be understated. This decoupling of energy sector emissions and economic growth should put to rest the argument that combatting climate change requires accepting lower growth or a lower standard of living. In fact, although this decoupling is most pronounced in the United States, evidence that economies can grow while emissions do not is emerging around the world. [...] At the same time, evidence is mounting that any economic strategy that ignores carbon pollution will impose tremendous costs to the global economy and will result in fewer jobs and less economic growth over the long term.\n\nWhile it certainly seems true that the switch to renewables is irreversible, if Donald Trump were to succeed in the Koch-promoted efforts hes already adopted to trash his predecessors climate-and-energy initiatives, the switch could be slowed in the states, giving China and Europe the same kind of advantage as the Danish Vestas company got when it moved ahead on wind technology after the Reagan administration abandoned Americas wind-power lead in the 1980s. The only difference between then and now being that the consequences of Trumps actions would be for more damaging in the long run.\n\nBut Trumps attack on Obamas climate-related rules and other actions has many obstacles to overcome, including what likely will be a rash of lawsuits. It could be years before we know the outcome of his retrograde moves.\n\nOpposition to Trumps actions is, however, purely defensive. Whats needed is an accelerated approach to the transformation already underway.\n\nThe climate crisis is an emergency like no other, and it needs to be treated as such. Climate Mobilization and other environmental advocates, like Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.0rg, say the United States should address the changing climate the way we addressed World War II. Sacrifices were made to topple the Axis. A nation already deeply in debt and far from fully emerged from the Great Depression took on far more debt and transformed its economy to meet the military threat. The reason: Most Americans didnt think we had a choice.\n\nThe threat from climate change is greater than that of World War II. Denying it, ignoring it, failing to address it quickly are prescriptions for far more death and economic destruction than that war caused. Promoting the energy transformation, giving our agriculture and transportation systems deep makeovers, and reworking our cities are essential to fulfilling any hope that we can effectively ameliorate the impacts of climate change. Government policy at the municipal, state, regional and national level should be directed toward meeting the climate thread right now. Not in the 2020s. Not next week. Not tomorrow.\n\nFortunately, we have technology on our side, as the Canada Clean Energy folks point out. The claims made since the 1970s that wind and solar and other renewable sources of energy can never be anything more than niche technologies for hippies and tree-huggers can still be heard in some quarters like the Heartland Institute and, of course, the White House, but these grow ever less credible by the minute.\n\nAdopting policies that speed up what is already happeningfor instance, pushing for 100 percent renewables by 2040/50ought to be at the top of the progressive agenda. Given who is currently in control of the federal government, the best way to do that for the short run is at the city and state level. But we need national policy to do the job right. And that obviously requires changes at the top.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/31/1649099/-Canadian-study-transition-to-renewables-irreversible-But-U-S-needs-to-accelerate-transformation#read-more", "date": "2017/3/31"}, {"text": "You're not going to be able to hide from this one, Sen.

The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as The River of Blood.\" But before you doff your cap and offer a moment of silence in their memory, you should know this: the plaque is stuck to a flagpole at a Trump golf resort, and that can mean only one thing: the story is bullshit...\n\nNo. Uh-uh. No way.

There is nothing---NOTHING---the president of the United States will not lie about. The only thing that was remotely close to that, Mr. Gillespie said, was 11 miles up the river at the Battle of Balls Bluff in 1861, a rout of Union forces in which several hundred were killed.The River of Blood? he added. Nope, not there. [] Mr. Trump repeatedly said that numerous historians had told him that the golf club site was known as the River of Blood. But he said he did not remember their names.

John McCain is working to broker a rather suspect deal that would preserve the minority party's ability to block Supreme Court nomineesjust not this time around. Bloomberg writes:\n\nMcCain said a deal would require eight Democrats to vote to advance Gorsuchs nomination in return for a promise that in the future they would be able to block a nominee in extraordinary circumstances.

Content is that bag of money sitting in an apartment. Process is how it left the bank.\n\nIn this case, the process was clearly all about deception.\n\nAt least three senior White House officials, including the top lawyer for the National Security Council, were involved in the handling of intelligence files that were shared with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and showed that Trump campaign officials were swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign nationals, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe White House generated this information. And it wasnt low level staffers or long-term intelligence agents in the normal course of business. The information was provided to Nunes by men who foundor createdthe information for purposes of driving a narrative.\n\nThe first of these was Ezra Cohen-Watnick. Cohen-Watnicka Michael Flynn protege who shared his former bosss disdain for the CIAwas nearly ousted from his role at the NSC just two weeks ago. But by that point he had already been hand selected to search for anything that could be used to support Donald Trumps wiretapp distraction. When it seemed possible that Cohen-Watnick might be pushed into a place where he couldnt properly support the project, he ran to Kushner and Bannon.\n\nOn Friday, McMaster told the National Security Councils senior director for intelligence programs, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, that he would be moved to another position in the organization. [] But Cohen-Watnick appealed McMasters decision to two influential allies with whom he had forged a relationship while working on Trumps transition team  White House advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. They brought the matter to Trump on Sunday, and the president agreed that Cohen-Watnick should remain as the NSCs intelligence director, according to two people with knowledge of the episode.\n\nCohen-Watnick had to stay in place because he was critical to the project. He had the task of looking through the original documents for incidental pickup of Trump associates, turning those incidents into something that looked menacing, and passing on that information to the next man in the team.\n\nJohn Eisenberg, the NSCs top lawyer, was also put in place by Flynn. He was in the Justice Department during the Bush administration, where (not shockingly) he argued in favor of expanding governments ability to conduct warrantless wiretapping. Eisenberg looked over Cohen-Watnicks material and acted as coordinator for the project. He also brought in the necessary White House player.\n\nMichael Ellis is another attorney in the Trump White House and reports to Eisenberg. But before joining on with Trump, Ellis worked for the House and directly with Devin Nunes. That existing relationship was important, because Ellis role in the project was to call Nunes and get him over to the White House, pronto.\n\nFrom everything available now, this seems to be how the project took place.\n\n4 March\n\nIn the early hours of March 4, Donald Trump tweeted that he:\n\n\"just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\"\n\nAt some point following Trumps tweets, Ezra Cohen-Watnick was assigned to read through intercepts and other documents to find some support for Trumps claims. This is why the White House continued to stall and make statements hinting that information was forthcoming.\n\n9 March\n\nWithin a week, Cohen-Watnicks desperate digging and pushing had proven so disruptive that National Security Advisor H.R. McMastersapparently unaware of the projectdecided something had to be done. He told the 30-year-old Cohen-Watnick he was being moved to a new position.\n\n10 March\n\nCohen-Watnick appealed his move to Bannon and Kushner, explaining again how someone else in the role wouldnt be able to find or generate the information Trump needed.\n\n11 March\n\nBannon and Kushner took Cohen-Watnicks appeal to Trump, who immediately overruled McMcaster.\n\n13 March\n\nSean Spicer says that Trump didnt mean a literal wiretap. \"The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities ... paving the way for the use of intercept materials.\n\n15 March\n\nDevin Nunes says he does not believe Trump Tower was bugged, but says that Trump campaign communications could have been incidentally collectedan amazingly prescient statement that indicates Nunes had already been looped into the project at some level.\n\n21 March\n\nWhile traveling with staffers, Nunes received a text, which likely originated from Michael Ellis. Nunes was in a car at the time, but he jumped out of the car without informing others of what he had learned or where he was going.\n\nNunes then went to the White House, where Ellis may have been the one to sign him in. At this point, Nunes apparently went to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where both Ellis and Cohen-Watnick have their offices. There he met with Cohen-Watnick, Eisenberg and Ellis.\n\nThough Nunes has described the information in various ways, saying both that he knew the information before he arrived and that he was surprised by what he read, it seems likely that Nunes did not view any original documents. Instead, he was given reports or summaries prepared for him by Cohen-Watnick. These summaries sometimes included the numbers for original documents, some of which Nunes says he recorded, but they were lacking in information that allowed Nunes to provide any details or answer questions about the real nature and setting of intercepts.\n\n22 March\n\nEarly in the morning, Nunes has a meeting with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Why Nunes goes to Ryan remains unclear, but the things that Nunes says to Ryan are extremely interesting:\n\nHe had told me that  like, a whistleblower-type person had given him some information that was new that spoke to the last administration and part of this investigation, Ryan said. He briefs me about it, didnt know the content of it, only knew the nature of it and that he was going to brief others.\n\nIts immediately clear that either Devin Nunes lied to Paul Ryan or Paul Ryan is lying. None of the three people that Nunes met with could possibly be construed as a whistleblower of any sort. They all have direct contact with either Trump or high officials in the White House, and far from making a discovery at odds with the desires of those above them, the three are directly working on a project to help Donald Trump. They are the opposite of whistleblowers. They are smoke blowers.\n\nRyan also states in several ways that Nunes has apparently not seen the actual documents. This again backs up the idea that what Nunes was shown was simply summaries or reports created for the purpose by Cohen-Watnick. How these reports align with the source documents is unclear. Ryan also says this about the end of his meeting with Nunes.\n\n\"He was going to brief everybody.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Ryan, Devin Nunes calls an unexpected press conference.\n\nI recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/31/1649068/-Devin-Nunes-shouldn-t-resign-from-the-intelligence-committee-he-should-resign-from-the-House#read-more", "date": "2017/3/31"}, {"text": "Among the latest bad hombres targeted by immigration officials within the past few days: two Texas doctors with an appointment book packed with patients waiting for medical care.\n\nTwo prominent Houston doctors facing removal by immigration officials to their native India have been granted a temporary, 90-day reprieve while they try to sort the paper-work that will allow them to continue living and working legally in the United States.

Step aside Pope Francis, because this Texas Republican seems know exactly who:\n\nOne lawmaker is citing a godly reference to justify changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.) recently quoted the New Testament to question the strength of current work requirements. [...] House Republicans have historically cited the verse  if a man will not work, he shall not eat  as justification for cutting some adults SNAP benefits. Arrington referenced the verse in a discussion about increasing the work requirements for unemployed adults on the food stamp program. But critics say that advances a pernicious myth about the unemployed who receive SNAP. The verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to, said theologians from several denominations who spoke to The Post. There is a perception, among some voters and lawmakers, that many adult SNAP recipients are exactly this sort of freeloader. But policy experts say that is not the case. Many unemployed adults on SNAP simply cannot work, they say. Those include the mentally ill, the borderline disabled and veterans.\n\nLocal surveys of SNAP users have shown that many adults who are not working have recently been released from jail, notes the Washington Post, or are homeless, veterans, noncustodial parents, people with undiagnosed mental illnesses and teenagers aging out of the foster care system. Basically, vulnerable Americans who need the help the most. This is a matter of humanity, dignity, and compassion, because it could be any one of us one day.\n\nBut that still hasnt stopped phony Christians like Arrington from using Jesus to oppose everything from marriage equality to affordable health care, despite the fact that Jesus never once condemned gays or asked a leper for a copay. And when you look at what Jesus actually did say about the hungry, that same New Testament is pretty clear: I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink.\n\nBut its poor people who are the lazy moochers, right?

His distant management style has created growing bewilderment among foreign officials who are struggling to understand where the United States stands on key issues. It has sown mistrust among career employees at State, who swap paranoid stories about Tillerson that often turn out to be untrue.

There have been two recent surveys of the race, one from independent pollster OpinionSavvy, the other from Republican pollster Clout Research (which had a very poor track record under its old name, Wenzel Strategies). However, both had similar results: OpinionSavvy put Ossoff at 40 percent while Clout had him at 41.\n\nIn both cases, Ossoff was well out in front of all other candidates, but it's a long way to get from 40 to 50, especially in a district as traditionally Republican as this one. One analyst, the New York Times' Nate Cohn, has suggested that the early voting data looks positive for Ossoff, but we all remember what the early vote supposedly told us about last November's elections, so it would be wise not to get excited by this data.\n\nHowever, one thing working in Ossoff's favor is the badly fractured Republican field. In a straight D-vs.-R race, it might be easier for the GOP to rally around a single standard-bearer. Instead, though, there are at least four or five plausible options in the running, so there's no one obvious choice with an (R) after his or her name for less plugged-in Republican voters to naturally coalesce around.\n\nAnd that situation could get worse rather than better. Earlier this week, the Club for Growth launched a $250,000 round of ads attacking former Secretary of State Karen Handel, who's the nominal Republican frontrunner just by virtue of her higher name recognition. Now Handel has responded with a rather defensive-sounding spot in which she complains about the \"gimmicks\" her opponents have used in their own ads as a bunch of old-school CRT TVs loaded into the back of a pickup truck situated in a random field (because that's totally normal) play clips of them. (Also, how are those TVs plugged in?)\n\nThere's no word on the size of the buy, but Handel and all of her fellow Republicans face a serious conundrum: They're going to try to tear each other down in order to be the one who winds up in second placefor a runoff that might not even happen. So while Stivers while try his level best to keep Ossoff from securing a first-round knockout, he won't be getting any help from any of the GOP candidates, who will only be focused on their own fates. That's not a pleasant situation for any party to find itself in.\n\nOf course, this could all be a Republican effort to try to up the expectations for Ossoff: If a runoff does ensue, which is still the most likely outcome, they'll claim he somehow underperformed. That would be bunk, of course, but that's typical politics. However, if the NRCC does actually shell out cash here before April 18, we'll know they weren't just playing games.\n\n ME-Sen: Independent Sen. Angus King doesn't typically top the list of most vulnerable members of the Democratic caucus, but Hillary Clinton's soft 48-45 victory in Maine means he might not be able to rest easy. Few Republicans are itching to challenge King, but state Sen. Eric Brakey recently formed an exploratory committee ahead of a potential campaign. Brakey, who hails from the GOP's Ron Paul wing, did not reveal when he might reach a decision about running.\n\nThe only other Republican openly considering running is Gov. Paul LePage. However, there's a good chance that the governor isn't that serious about it, given his history of making similar claims about running for races without following through on them.\n\n NV-Sen: Despite Sen. Dean Heller being the only Republican up in 2018 whose state voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, the Democratic field has been slow to develop. However, we can add one more name to the list: Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson says he's been encouraged to challenge Heller, and he didn't rule anything out. Clark County is home to Las Vegas and over 70 percent of the state's population, which could give Wolfson a good geographic base against Heller if he does run. Few other Democrats have gone on the record about their intentions, but Rep. Dina Titus has previously said she was considering the race.\n\n WI-Sen: Catholic school administrator Nicole Schneider joins the growing list of Republicans considering a campaign against Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, saying she and her family are \"examining options.\" Schneider appears to be very wealthy and could possibly self-fund a substantial amount, but it's unclear if the would-be first-time candidate has the chops to run a serious race.\n\nSeveral other Republicans are also openly mulling running, including state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, state Sen. Leah Vukmir, businessman Kevin Nicholson, and rich guy Eric Hovde, who lost the primary for this seat in 2012. Nicholson hasn't formally announced yet, but Republican mega-donor Richard Uihlein has already plopped down $2 million for a super PAC to support him if he does run.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n IA-Gov: Johnson County Supervisor Mike Carberry, who was one of the most prominent Bernie Sanders supporters in Iowa last year, has confirmed to Bleeding Heartland that he's considering a bid for governor in 2018. Two Democrats are already running, while many more are looking at the race. You can get a complete rundown of the field in our recent recap of all the players.\n\n ME-Gov: No Democrats have entered the race yet to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Paul LePage in 2018, but many potential candidates are thinking about doing so. Businessman Adam Cote tells Politico that he has had talks with the DGA, but he hasn't decided whether to run yet and didn't give a timetable for when he might do so. Cote has never held elective office before, but he previously was the runner-up in the 2008 primary against now-Rep. Chellie Pingree for Maine's 1st Congressional District.\n\nOther Democrats who have said they're considering a gubernatorial bid include: state Attorney General Janet Mills; state Senate Minority Leader Justin Alfond; Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap; car dealer Adam Lee; and construction company owner and former state Senate candidate Jonathan Fulford.\n\n NY-Gov: Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, who unsuccessfully challenged Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2014, isn't ruling out a rematch, saying he'll \"let that play itself out next year.\" That's a pretty lackadaisical approach for a Republican running in a state as blue as New York, though. While Cuomo hasn't formally announced that he'll seek a third term, he has an enormous $22 million war chest, and he used a comparable financial advantage to hold off Astorino by a 54-40 margin. And while Republicans have little hope of flipping the governor's mansion, several are nonetheless contemplating bids, so if Astorino isn't exactly positioning himself well if he wants to take another shot.\n\nHouse\n\n MT-AL: Wealthy Republican businessman Greg Gianforte just announced that he's brought in $1.5 million for the May 25 special election for Montana's at-large House seat, double the amount raised by his Democratic opponent, musician Rob Quist. However, from press reports, it's not clear whether Gianforte, who gave $6 million to his own unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign last year, has once again done any self-funding. The campaign's first-quarter fundraising reports are not due at the FEC until April 15.\n\nGrab Bag\n\n Census: There was a noteworthy little kerfuffle on Tuesday that mostly only devoted Census-watchers saw, but that has a big impact on who we count and how that impacts public policy. There was a report issued on Tuesday that mentioned, deep in the fine print, that the Census Bureau was planning to start asking about LGBT status in the 2020 Census and American Community Survey. After several hours, that line mysteriously disappeared from the online report, leaving observers to wonder if that had suddenly been nixed by higher-ups within the Trump administration. The Census director, John Thompson, subsequently wrote that the line had been included \"in error,\" which certainly still leaves a lot of question marks.\n\nInclusion of LGBT status would indeed be surprising in the 2020 count; the 2010 count asked essentially the bare minimum needed for reapportionment and redistricting (total population plus race and Hispanic status). It would fit seamlessly and easily enough within the American Community Survey, though (an ongoing random sample that replaces the once-a-decade long form), which already asks a similar question (number of households headed by same-sex partners) but, nevertheless, one that disregards LGBT persons not in a formally-recognized relationship.\n\nFor what it's worth, though, the data from the 2011-16 ACS shows that the counties that have the highest levels of same-sex partner households are, in fact, the places that you'd expect anyway, as centers of LGBT culture. While the absolute highest percentage is in rural Mason County, Texas (population 4,000), if you limit it to more populous counties where sample size issues aren't likely to create anomalies, the top five are San Francisco, CA; Washington, DC; Monroe Co., FL (Key West); New York Co., NY (Manhattan); and Hampshire Co., MA (Northampton).\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/31/1648906/-Morning-Digest-Republicans-worry-Ossoff-could-win-without-a-runoff-but-is-that-realistic#read-more", "date": "2017/3/31"}, {"text": "We begin todays roundup with the bombshell story that former Trump national security advisor Mike Flynn is reportedly asking for immunity in exchange for his testimony.

The list is a striking display of how the Obama and Trump administrations differ in their approach to enforcing the nations workplace safety laws.

While GM, Ford, and Chrysler production in Mexico increased in 2008, it fell in the United States and Canada. GM has invested $3.6 billion in Mexico in the past three years and is increasing its commitment to Mexican production by having its new Aveo subcompact built there instead of in the United States (Black 2008). And the Big Three plan even greater future investments outside of the United States: GM announced plans to invest $1 billion in Brazil (Ortolani 2008), and Chrysler is investing $570 million in a new engine factory near Saltillo in the Mexican state of Coahuila. At the same time, GM and Chrysler are seeking nearly $22 billion in additional restructuring aid from the Obama administration. This, writes Scott, indicates a clear need for the government to make future taxpaid funding for GM and Chrysler dependent on a restructuring that includes an investment here at home instead of sending those production jobs out of the country. The problem is that administration's Path to Viability for GM and Chrysler that requires aggressive restructuring also may contribute to further pushing the companies to reduce their U.S. manufacturing footprint and increase their outsourcing off-shoring. That would add more losses to the 369,000 jobs already lost in the auto industry and auto parts makers since December 2007. And when recovery does happen, more U.S. auto jobs would be outside the country than ever before. As Scott says, \"This would conflict with the Presidents announced 'commitment to support an auto industry that can help revive modern manufacturing.'\"\n\nHIGH IMPACT STORIES  TOP COMMENTS  OVERNIGHT NEWS DIGEST\n\nOn todays Kagro in the Morning show: Mike Pence: weirdo.

Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper want to know exactly which ethics rules she will be required to comply with in her unprecedented role. Kelsey Sutton writes:\n\nWarren (D-Mass.) and Carper (D-Del.) sent a letter to [Office of Government Ethics] director Walter Shaub on Wednesday asking whether the White House has requested or received guidance from the office about Ivanka Trumps role in the White House and the rules about disclosures, divestments and recusals that could be required of her amid her growing White House role.\n\nIn the letter, they write:\n\nEthics rules are important. Federal conflict of interest laws prohibit an \"officer or employee of the executive branch\"  including those with positions at the White House  from participating in matters that have a direct impact on their personal and their family members' financial interests. Ms. Trump has substantial interests at stake: for example, she has retained ownership of Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, a retail clothing brand.\n\nThe letter goes on to inquire about whether the White House has sought guidance from the Office of Government Ethics about Ivanka's role (just guessing thats a no), which ethics standards she will have to comply with, if her role has even been determined to be \"consistent\" with current ethics laws and precedents, what disclosures she will have to make, and what she would be required to do if she were determined to be serving in an \"official\" capacity in the government (i.e. what's the White House circumventing by keeping her role \"unofficial,\" never mind that security clearance she's seeking.)", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/29/1648480/-Sens-Warren-Carper-seek-Ethics-oversight-of-Ivanka-s-new-unofficial-invasion-of-the-West-Wing#read-more", "date": "2017/3/29"}, {"text": "Now its possible that these shifts are one-offs, and these areas will return to their historic Republican roots. But an ongoing election shows that that might not be the case. Georgias 6th Congressional District similarly covers a suburban area outside a big southern city that has historically voted Republican. After a big Democratic shift toward Clinton in 2016, the seat is now in the middle of a highly competitive special election where a young, personable Democrat has the GOP running scared. (You may have heard of him.)\n\nIn a neutral year with generic candidates, these ongoing shifts, even accelerated by Trump, would not be enough for ORourke to win. But additional factors are far more likely to help ORourke than to hurt him.\n\nThe Cycle\n\nAs anyone who has followed American politics can tell you, a states partisanship changes slowly over long periods of time. But if that were the only factor in elections, politics would get pretty boring. Each election also brings unique factors that collectively tend to benefit one party or the other. This can be anywhere from a light breeze to a strong wave depending on the year. The most important factors are whether its a midterm or presidential year, which party holds the presidency, and how popular the president is. For example, 2010 was a midterm year with a Democratic president holding middling approval ratings. This was a central factor in Republican Mark Kirk winning a Senate seat in deep-blue Illinois. Had any of those factors been different, he probably wouldnt have won.\n\nLets return to Wendy Davis campaign for Texas governor. 2014 was a not-unexpectedly poor cycle for Democrats. It was a midterm, they held the presidency, and Obama was not particularly popular. In a year where Democrats lost the Illinois, Massachusetts, and Maryland governors races, is it any surprise that they got slammed in the Texas race as well?\n\nTwo of these cyclical factors are already known for 2018. Its a midterm cycle and a Republican will be president. This combination should help Democrats, though recent midterms have seen Democrats struggle with turning out their younger, more diverse base. But running in a midterm against the president has been a recipe for success for decades. Its even more effective when that president isnt particularly popular at the time.\n\nMany elections have shown how presidential job approval correlates with the presidents partys results in midterm elections. Its most clear in the House, where all 435 seats are up each cycle, while the limited numbers of seats and states up in the Senate causes variation in the results. But focusing just on one race in one state, as we are here, means that the worse President Trumps approval rating is in 2018, the better for ORourke. We obviously cant know what that will be in the future but we know that Trump is currently averaging 40 percent approval, far below any other president this early in an administration.\n\nThe last time an unpopular GOP president faced a midterm election, in 2006, Democrats won six senate seats, including in states like Missouri and Montana. They even made a Tennessee Senate race competitive, only losing 51-48 despite the states deep-red hue. Tennessee is by all accounts, even more Republican than Texas is.\n\nAll signs point to 2018 being a good cycle for Democrats, which ORourke will absolutely need to make this race competitive. But theres one last factor to consider: the candidates themselves.\n\nThe Candidates\n\nORourke is a young, personable, successful businessman who played in punk rock bands during and after college. Ted Cruz is, well, Ted Cruz. Theres a tendency to overemphasize candidate quality when looking at legislative races (great candidates lose to terrible candidates all the time) but it is a factor. While ORourke has never run statewide before, he impressively defeated an incumbent Democratic congressman in a primary in 2012.\n\nCruz is excellent at running as far to the right as humanly possible and making everyone else who meets him loathe him. Hes never run a competitive general election campaign nor attempted to appeal to even moderate Republicans (though in fairness, neither has ORourke). According to the University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll, Cruzs favorability in the state is way underwater at 32 percent favorable to 49 percent unfavorable as of October 2016. His job approval rating this February was only slightly better at 38 percent approve to 39 percent disapprove.\n\nTed Cruz only seems intimidating because hes extremely well-known nationally and came in second in the GOP primary last year. But hes no Chuck Grassley, with decades of crossover appeal to fall back on. In reality, hes a not-very-popular freshman senator embarking on his first re-election campaign.\n\nA Reality Check\n\nNone of this is to say that there arent significant challenges on the road to victory. ORourke suffers from a massive name recognition deficit and will likely be outspent by tens of millions of dollars. Running a statewide race in a state like Texas doesnt allow you to leverage your personal popularity the way that Heidi Heitkamp can in North Dakota. The state remains Republican leaning, which can save even unpopular candidates in bad years (such as Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy in 2014). And we dont ultimately know what the political reality will be on November 6, 2018. But if ORourke can raise the money and run a good race, all signs point to this race being far more competitive than people currently think.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/30/1648431/-Beto-O-Rourke-could-give-Democrats-their-best-chance-to-win-a-Texas-Senate-seat-in-a-generation#read-more", "date": "2017/3/30"}, {"text": "\"Democrat\" David Clarke\n\nThis would be awesome: Former Milwaukee Police Captain Earnell Lucas will challenge notorious Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke in next year's Democratic primary, according to a consultant working for Lucas.

That effort collapsed, but now Trump is taking a more direct whack at flu-tracking funding.\n\nThe new effort? A $1 billion cut to the Department of Agriculture, plus revoking most of the remaining budget from the 2015 funding to combat that year's disastrous bird flu epidemic. They plan to use that $50 million, like all their other petty cuts to decent programs, to supersize the military and, we'll assume, give some specific billionaire yet another tax cut.\n\nBack here in 2017, however, a new avian flu strain is popping back up in multiple states. It's too soon to say if it will become a full-on epidemic, but it is a handy reminder that we will undoubtably be spending more money on avian flu, not less.\n\nAnd the government spends money on these things because not only do they want to avoid a repeat of 2015, when 48 million birds had to be culled from American producers, but because avian flu needs only slight mutations to spread to humans, and we want to avoid a human pandemic.\n\nWhats the Trump-Ryan solution?", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/30/1648493/-Trump-wants-to-make-avian-flu-great-again#read-more", "date": "2017/3/30"}, {"text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' job is in no apparent danger, despite work from Steve Bannon's old hangout to the contrary, but Priebus' deputy Katie Walsh is either fleeing the ship or has been tossed from it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump launched his first West Wing shake-up less than three months into his term, sending deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to bolster the flagging outside groups that were meant to support his agenda, according to a Republican source close to the White House and a senior administration official. [...] Walsh is expected to serve as an adviser both to a pro-Trump nonprofit and the RNC. The non-profit, America First, is stocked with veterans of the campaign and has been struggling to get off the ground.\n\nWhich is a good fit, because Walsh already has a lot of experience with Trump veterans struggling to get things off the ground.

The Mercer family just plunked down $1.3 million for new ads fluffing Trump; if the White House is to be believed (hint: no) they're dispatching a top-level White House lieutenant to oversee a different pro-Trump propaganda effort because they think thats a more critical effort than the actual governing part theyre so badly screwing up.\n\nKeep in mind, though: it's only March. Trump took office only two short months ago, and his allies are already scrambling to save him from a stream of foreign policy blunders, executive order fiascos, and a legislative agenda that's going over about as well as if he had promised to put a dead fish in every mailbox. If Team Trump is really willing to shed White House staff to outside Trump-fluffing efforts after only two months, thats a sign of apoplectic desperation.\n\nAs for whether we can believe that the White House really did dispatch Walsh on their own initiative, that again presumes that you can believe anything that comes out of the White House that brazenly lies to reporters on an hourly basis. Perhaps they did initiate the move, or perhaps Walsh is fleeing the White House grounds to take another job because of the reportedly toxic and chaotic environment within the building.

Greg Walden of Oregon, ally of the insurance industry and, by default, Obamacare\n\nOne of the most tempting ways for the Trump administration to do serious damage to Obamacare has to be the lawsuit held over from the Obama administration challenging cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nCooked up by former Speaker John Boehner back when Boehner mattered, the suit was originally considered nothing more than a nuisance case because most courts have stayed well out of disputes between Congress and the executive branch, because they don't see it's their role to mess about in the disputes of the other two branches, and because there are myriad constitutional ways in which those two branches can figure it out on their own. But Boehner, and now by extension Paul Ryan, got lucky and got a sympathetic judge.\n\nSo from the excellent Nicholas Bagely, here's the question that's now hanging over the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, who have no real capacity to repeal and replace Obamacare:\n\nA pending court case, House v. Price (ne House v. Burwelland so much turns on the name change), has given the administration a bomb it could use to blow up insurance markets across the country. At stake is the legality of the payments the federal government makes to insurance companies to help cover the medical expenses of low-income people. Destroying those markets, however, carries huge political risks. Trump's full-throated support for a reckless replacement bill has convinced millions of Americans that he's intent on taking away their insurance. If their insurance does go away, they'll probably blame him. It's his presidency, and his problem. By moving to defuse House v. Price, the Trump administration could signal that it means to make the best of Obamacare. At the same time, however, the case may represent the last best chance to rip the statute up from the roots. Skittish insurers are watching closely to see what the administration will do. Time is short: Insurers will have to decide very soon whether they want to participate on Obamacares exchanges in 2018.\n\nIt's the insurers that are the key, here.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/30/1648519/-Two-top-Republicans-signal-they-aren-t-ready-to-blow-up-Obamacare-in-the-courts#read-more", "date": "2017/3/30"}, {"text": "According to a new report issued by the Justice Departments Inspector General, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has seized billions of dollars in cash from people suspected of drug activity but were never charged with criminal activity:\n\nSince 2007, the report found, the DEA has seized more than $4 billion in cash from people suspected of involvement with the drug trade.

Al Franken was not amused by Gorsuch's performance.\n\nThursday marked both real high points and frustrating lows for Democrats considering the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Standing up for transparency, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Al Franken (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) wrote to Gorsuch and the dark money group backing his nomination, the Judicial Crisis Network, calling on them to reveal who has spent $17 million on Gorsuchs nomination fight. The Senators want answers before Gorsuchs confirmation vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.\n\n\"Because the organization is not required to disclose the identities of its donors, the American people have no idea who is so aggressively advocating for your confirmation, or why,\" the Senators write in their letter to Gorsuch. \"When asked why you thought JCN was willing to spend $17 million ensuring your confirmation over that of exceptionally qualified Judge Garland, you responded that we should ask them. We have now done so.\"\n\nGorsuch's lack of transparency and refusal to answer questions wasn't limited to just who was spending millions on getting him onto the bench. He was elusive and slippery throughout, leading veteran court watcher and reporter Linda Greenhouse to declare:\n\nIf Judge Gorsuch wasnt the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee ever to appear at a confirmation hearing, its hard to imagine one who could be less forthcoming while still breathing. More interesting and less predictable answers could have come from Siri on an iPhone. [.] In any event, all Judge Gorsuch had to say about the right to abortion  as well as about the 51-year-old constitutional right to use birth controlwas that it was supported by precedent. In answer to a question from Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committees chairman, about what he had to say about Roe v. Wade, the nominee answered: I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, was a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. Elaborating ever so slightly, he went on to observe that the decision had been reaffirmed and that people relied on it. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy of treatment as precedent like any other. Precedents, of course, receive all kinds of treatment at the hands of future courts, from a warm embrace to being whittled away to outright overruling. What kind of treatment Judge Gorsuch thinks the courts abortion precedents deserve was left neatly unspecified.\n\nIt's timely for Greenhouse to highlight Roe, as today Vice President Mike Pence had to make a trip to the Senate to break a tie vote on women's access to reproductive health care. On limiting women's access to reproductive health care. As Sen. Patty Murray responded on the floor and in a series of tweets, that makes stopping Gorsuch even more important. \"If the buck has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights,\" she said \"Judge Gorsuch is not the person to be anywhere near the bench.\n\nThat would be a good thing for her to sit down with Sen. Claire McCaskill and chat about. Because McCaskill is continuing to operate under the dual delusions that there's going to be worse than Gorsuch coming from Trump, and that by not filibustering him, somehow Mitch McConnell will be nice in the future and not nuke the filibuster. This is a profound misunderstanding of just how extreme Gorsuch is and just how unprincipled Mitch McConnell will be. McCaskill needs to spend some serious time thinking about what she, personally, is willing to stand for on this one.\n\nThat was one of today's lows in the Gorsuch saga. The others were the back-to-back announcements from Sens. Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp that they would vote for cloture and for confirmation (think they timed it together?). Neither vote is a surprise as they'd both been telegraphing that this was likely from the moment Gorsuch was nominated.

Maria Cantwell (D-WA). There are now at least 30 Democrats behind a filibuster.

Were not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico. And were probably not going to put it in the middle of the river. Democrats argued that Zinkes remark implied that the administration was actively contemplating building a wall in Mexico, which would be both legally dubious and diplomatically problematic. But Zinkes spokeswoman Heather Swift said this was a misreading. Secretary Zinke was talking about a combo of natural boundaries, fence, wall, towers, surveillance, etc. and regarding the river he was noting challenges that are being looked at, she emailed. He wasnt proposing any policy.\n\nThe Trump regime is already set on kicking Americans off their land, pushing cuts to education and medical research, and slashing Meals on Wheels, FEMA, the Coast Guard, and TSA to build his monument to hate, but it looks like at least Mexicans dont have anything to worry about for the moment.\n\nHowever, as we noted yesterday, the clarification of Zinkes statement is still newsworthy in its own right:\n\nTrump, after all, spent the campaign insisting that he would build a big, beautiful wall along the Mexican border that would have a large door to let in legal immigrants and would be entirely paid for by the Mexican government. Mexico has refused to pay for it.

That means theyre in charge of the chambers entire agenda, and it also means, by definition, that they as a party have enough votes to secure passage of any piece of legislation.\n\nSo if House Republicans cant pass a spending bill to keep the government open past April 28, when current funding will run out, its the Republicans fault. Thats it. Thats all there is to it.\n\nOf course, real life isnt anywhere near this simple for Paul Ryan and the GOP, because the Republicans no longer represent an actual political partytheyre just a collection of warring nihilists who, after half a century of trying to tear down the government, are incapable of putting together a coherent agenda for running it.\n\nAnd since a sizable contingent of this band of dystopians wont vote for any spending bill that doesnt defund Planned Parenthoodwhich would be dead on arrival in the Senate, where Republicans need at least eight Democratic votes for passagethat means Ryan has a majority in name only. Just like his counterparts in the Senate, Ryan would need the help of Democrats to pass a spending bill.\n\nThats why pathetic Republicans are indeed praying for Democratic votes right nowin the House, a purely majority-rule institution where the aide of the minority should never be necessary. Its a truly embarrassing spectacle for a party that, by sheer numbers, is at the height of its power. But when are Republicans anything but embarrassing?\n\nAnd Democrats, it should go without saying, are under no obligation to spare Republicans their embarrassment. Again, this is all on the GOP. The fact that Ryans party cant get its act together is the Republicans own fault, not the Democrats. If the GOP cant pass a spending bill with Republican votes, then they and only they will be responsible for any shutdown that ensues.\n\nOf course, there is an alternative: Moderate Republicans sick of all this madness could simply vote to elect Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House and make this all her problem.

Bill Nelson's announcement that he would support a filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court may have been a pivotal moment in the Democrats' efforts to block Gorsuch's confirmationand, predictably, it also gave Florida Republicans an opening to attack the senator. One of the grouchiest was Rep. Tom Rooney, who issued a statement criticizing Nelson, then confirmed through his office that he's \"weighing all his options for 2018 and doesn't know for sure what he is doing yet.\"\n\nThe same Rooney spokesperson disingenuously claimed that her boss's press release \"had nothing to do with 2018,\" but we know that the wealthy Rooney's entertained dreams of higher office in the past. Last cycle, Rooney considered a bid for Marco Rubio's Senate seat, back during that long-ago time when Marco Rubio had sworn he was never, ever gonna run for re-election, but he backed down early on.\n\nBut as the Palm Beach Post notes, when Rooney was looking at a Senate campaign in 2015, he observed that running in 2018 would amount to \"bad timing\" if Gov. Rick Scott were also in the race. Scott hasn't yet announced his plans, but he's publicly said he's considering a challenge to Nelson. If he does, that would likely keep Rooneyand most of the rest of the GOPout.\n\n TX-Sen: According to unnamed \"Democratic sources\" cited by the Houston Chronicle, Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who has openly been considering a challenge to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, will launch a campaign for Senate on Friday. While such a bid would be a long shot in solidly red Texas, O'Rourke has long insisted he would serve no more than four terms in the House, so next year's election would have been his last either way. We'll take a closer look at the impact of this move, though, if and when it actually happens. Candidates reportedly on the verge of announcing bids for higher office have backed off more than once in the pastjust ask Dave Catanese.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Joaquin Castro, who has also been weighing a Senate run, reacted to the news by saying he's still thinking about it and will announce his decision \"in the coming weeks.\" If both Castro and O'Rourke were to go for it, that would set up an interesting and unusually competitive Democratic primaryfor a prize that has been out of reach for Team Blue ever since Lloyd Bentsen won a final term in the Senate in 1988 as he simultaneously was losing his bid for the vice-presidency.\n\n UT-Sen: GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch has been playing games about his re-election plans for a long time, and now he's continuing the fun. In a new interview, Hatch says he might step aside and choose not to seek an eighth term (an apparently flexible promise he made when he was seeking a seventh) if the perfect replacement candidate came along. Who might that be? \"Mitt Romney would be perfect,\" says Hatch. Romney's team wouldn't comment on Hatch's latest shenanigans, but last month, Mitt declared, \"All doors are open.\"\n\nGubernatorial\n\n AL-Gov: Republican Twinkle Cavanaugh, the chair of Alabama's Public Service Commission, has filed paperwork to create a campaign committee, apparently making her the first candidate to take formal steps toward running in next year's race for governor. While Cavanaugh's name had previously been mentioned, this is the first time we've heard from her directly, and oddly, though she submitted her papers a month ago, she hadn't said anything publicly until now. (Cavanaugh confirmed to AL.com that her committee is a \"vehicle to plan for a run for governor,\" adding, \"Stay tuned!\")\n\nA whole boatload of other Republicans are looking at this race (and a few Democrats, too), but as we've chronicled in detail, major questions remain to be resolved regarding the current occupant of the governor's mansion, Republican Robert Bentley, who is currently being investigated by state lawmakers as part of an impeachment inquiry. If Bentley is impeached or removed from office, that would elevate Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey to his post, potentially upending the race to succeed him. But whatever happens, ambitious candidates like Cavanaugh have to start preparing, and they can't wait around for action from the slow-moving legislature, which has been considering the matter for a year now.\n\n GA-Gov: We can add one more name to the long list of Republicans reportedly considering bids for next year's open gubernatorial race: state Sen. Hunter Hill, who has reportedly told colleagues that he won't seek re-election but is instead looking at a run for governor. But, suggests the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hill would likely be an underdog in a primary that will probably feature Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who is president of the Senate. We should have a better sense of the field soon, though, as the legislature's session is set to end this week.\n\n RI-Gov, RI-Sen: Okely dokely, neighborinos! Former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders, whose name had previously come up in connection with a potential gubernatorial bid, instead says he will form an exploratory committee to look at a possible challenge to Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. That's an incredibly tentative toe in the water, and we ordinarily wouldn't even spend time on a Senate contest that's sure to be a dud (Whitehouse is the heavy favorite), but this presumably means we can take Flanders' name out of contention for the more competitive governor's race, where Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo is beset on all sides.\n\n VA-Gov: To go along with their primary polling from a day earlier, Christopher Newport University has now released its general election matchups for Virginia's gubernatorial election this fall. The race is neck-and-neck between the leading Republican candidate, former RNC chair Ed Gillespie, and the two Democrats in the race, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and ex-Rep. Tom Perriello. Gillespie has a bare 40-39 edge over Northam and ties Perriello at 39 apiece.\n\nThe Democrats fare better against the two lesser-known Republican options: Northam beats Prince William County Supervisor Chair Corey Stewart 41-33 and state Sen. Frank Wagner 40-34. Perriello, likewise, leads Stewart 40-34 and Wagner 38-35.\n\nAlso interesting are the numbers for CNU's generic ballot for the state House, which Democrats lead by a sizable 48-41 spread. All 100 seats in the chamber are up for re-election this fall alongside the governorship, and if Democrats can maintain something like that 7-point edge, they could make major gains.\n\n WI-Gov: Former Democratic state Sen. Tim Cullen, who was no one's idea of a great candidate anyway, announced on Wednesday that he won't challenge Republican Gov. Scott Walker next year. Cullen seemed shocked to learn that he'd have to spend at least three to four hours a day raising money for a bid, which he complained was \"a very sad commentary on the state of democracy.\" That may be, but Cullen is not some nave newcomer. He was first elected to political office in the 1970s, so how could he be unaware of the realities of modern campaigning?\n\nAnyhow, Democrats still don't have anyone running in Wisconsin, though there are a number of names still in the mix. Walker hasn't formally announced he'll seek a third term either, but he does appear to be gearing up for a re-election bid.\n\nHouse\n\n MT-AL: Musician Rob Quist, who's running for the Democrats in the May 25 special election for Montana's at-large House seat, just announced that he's raised $754,000 since becoming his party's nominee on March 5. That's a considerable sum for a Democrat running a small red state, and speaks to the enthusiasm we've seen across the board from small-dollar progressive donors in the wake of Donald Trump's inauguration (a topic explored at greater length in this smart Politico analysis of ActBlue data).

In 2000, the United States derived half of its electricity from coal  a substantial share of it produced in aging plants built during the 1950s and 1960s (the decades of rising electricity demand). At this point, natural gas generated only 16 percent of electricity, and its stagnating domestic production seemed to make future large-scale imports of natural gas inevitable. Then came the rapid advances of hydraulic fracturing (shale gas and oil), and by 2009, the United States once again became the worlds largest producer of natural gas. The economics became irresistible. Burning clean natural gas in highly efficient gas turbines (which can convert 60 percent of fuels energy, compared with 40 percent in the best coal-fired stations) became the most obvious choice. Secondarily, falling costs of wind turbines and solar panels made these new renewables more affordable in windy and sunny locations. The result has been dramatic: In 2016, 30 percent of U.S. electricity came from coal (a reduction of more than 40 percent in 15 years), 34 percent originated from natural gas, and more than 6 percent came from wind and solar. Coal might not have fallen so quickly had electricity demand kept growing, but since 2010, consumption has been either flat or slightly declining.\n\nKathleen Parker at The Washington Post writesRepublicans would rather have a king than a president:\n\nMonarchical tendencies abound in the person of The Don, and the willing hordes find his splashy displays of ego and overabundance not just tolerable but, apparently, admirable. Desire for drama and pageantry  the commission paid to peasants for their complicity in the master-servant duet  is on full display, whether The Don is entertaining world leaders at his Mar-a-Lago palace or working deals over golf at one of his eponymous resorts. Meanwhile, the king installs his family in the peoples palace, rationing offices for commerce, diplomacy and foreign policy. Blood runs thick in royal clans. Daughter Ivanka, the ravishing offspring of Wife No. 1, is the only one Trump seems to really trust. He keeps her and husband Jared Kushner (the favored son?) close, while sending the eldest Trump boys on quests for fresh greens to conquer. Never mind that the little people are paying millions for the protection of all these Trumplings as they cross continents or sidewalks. The kings Secret Service begged an extra $27 million for next year  to protect Trump Tower and keep Melanias tresses from public reach  plus $33 million for various travel expenses for Trump and others.\n\nKate Aronoff at The Guardian writesDon't just defend Obama's legacy against Trump: fight for radical climate action:\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is rejoicing. Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that would tear up many of the so-called burdensome climate protections  those regulating things like power plant emissions and leasing to coal companies  put in place by the Obama administration. Horrified by this move, many have vowed to jump to their defense. Thats not enough. [...] Mustering anywhere near the political will necessary to enact changes as ambitious as the ones science demands means giving working people a stake in the climate fight and the policies its pushing for. Technocratic jargon wont cut it, but the silver lining of the climate crisis careening toward us is that the solutions to it lend themselves to populist times. In addition to taking on a fossil-fueled 1%, curbing greenhouse gas emissions also means fueling job creation in everything from clean energy to insulation to grid electrification to already low-carbon parts of our economy, such as nursing and healthcare. [...] A livable planet is no less of a right than healthcare, and climate policy should treat it as such. So defend the clean power plan from Trumps attacks, because God knows we need it. But dont forget to demand the changes we really need along the way.\n\nE.J. Dionne Jr. at The Washington Post writesTrump threatens to drown out the voices of despair:\n\nWhat ever happened to the interests of the working class? Werent they supposed to be front and center in the Trump administration? Heres one clue: When a policy that helps some corporate sector can be repackaged to make it look like a pro-worker move, President Trump will always hide his real purpose behind a phalanx of workers. Thus did he surround himself with coal miners on Tuesday when he signed a shamefully shortsighted executive order nullifying President Barack Obamas climate-change efforts.\n\nx Just think how amazing it is that both of these lines even fit on the same chart with the same axes. https://t.co/FPz6HJdVKK pic.twitter.com/Hr9h1LWCPu  Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 29, 2017\n\nMark Hertsgaard at The Nation writesWhy Trumps Climate-Wrecking Agenda Could Fail:\n\nWhile Team Trump continues to insist that the world is flat, gravity is not real, and climate change is unproven, major government and corporate players around the world are leaving coal behind, hedging their bets on oil and gas, and racing to embrace clean energy sourcessolar, wind, batteries, efficiencythat are plummeting in price, gobbling up market share, and widely regarded as the kingmaking technologies of the 21st-century economy. Sweet irony: Perhaps no one is racing faster than China, the economic and climate superpower whose gargantuan coal consumption has long been the favorite bogeyman of US climate deniers, who didnt want to take action in the first place. Why, they disingenuously asked, should the United States cut emissions when China is building a new coal plant every week? Well, not anymore, China isnt. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced to the annual National Peoples Congress on March 5 that China was canceling 50 gigawattsroughly equivalent to 50 large power plantsof coal-fired electricity production. This followed an additional cancellation, in 2016, of 120 gigawatts worth of existing or planned coal plants. These two transformational decisions, taken in the aftermath of the 2015 Paris climate summit that Trump loves to denigrate, mean that fully one sixth of all Chinas coal-fired power capacitymay be either shut down, or in the case of planned capacity, not get built, according to Zhang Chun, a senior researcher at the independent publication chinadialogue. Money and powertwo things Trump plainly cravesare driving Chinas about-face. Chinas economic planners, like their counterparts elsewhere, recognize that electricity demand is declining as efficiency technologies shrink the amount of power needed to run computers, refrigerators, and other equipment.\n\nZo Carpenter at The Nation writesTrumps Climate Order May Make it Harder to Prepare for Natural Disasters:\n\nThe order also rescinds two Obama administration directives that serve as the backbone of the governments climate adaptation work. Those orders did not impose new regulations on industry; instead, they were based on the idea that it makes good fiscal sense and is morally imperative to prepare for the effects of global warming, even while trying to limit it. One of the orders rolled back by Trump was issued in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy tore up the east coast, leaving in its wake $60 billion in damages. That order requires federal agencies to identify how climate change will affect their mission and programs, and to work with states and local communities to help them prepare. It was designed to address what were seeing nowextended droughts, extreme flooding, rapid sea level rise, deadly heat waves, said Alice Hill, who served as the senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council under President Obama. It was intended to protect federal assetsfor instance, to make sure that buildings built with taxpayer money werent sited in areas facing heightened flood riskand to protect local communities, by boosting their capacity and sharing information. [...] The other order rescinded by Trump directed the Department of Defense and other agencies to consider climate change impacts when developing national security plans. Among other things, that meant preparing military bases for rising sea levels, leveraging renewable energy, and studying the security risks posed by changing weather patterns with the potential to destabilize foreign governments and heighten cross-border conflicts.\n\nBill McKibben at The Guardian writesAmerica's deportation squads want to expel our neighbours. We are saying no:\n\nVermont, where I live, has the second-smallest population of any state. Its also among the most rural parts of America, and taken together those two facts produce an iron law: if you see someone with their car stuck in a snowbank, you dont drive by. You stop and help push. Because if you dont, nobody else may come by for an hour. Which is why, I think, many of us have spent part of the past couple weeks trying to win the freedom of three of our neighbors  Kike Balcazar, Zully Palacios and Alex Carrillo. They are undocumented immigrants, who came here to work on our farms, and were detained by the (aptly named) Ice, or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, in New Hampshire, awaiting deportation. [...] The arrest of these three was clearly punitive and retaliatory. They werent just farmworkers  they were leaders of the community, who had come out into the open to try to win some rights for their brethren. Two were picked up after they left the office of Migrant Justice, the local campaign that tries to improve conditions for the undocumented. The third was on the way to the local courthouse, where state prosecutors were waiting to dismiss an old DUI arrest. Its the type of Trumpish political repression we need to push back at whenever it happens.\n\nGraham Vyse at the New Republic writesWhy Are Democrats Fighting Over Free College?\n\nBoth New Yorks Andrew Cuomo and Rhode Islands Gina Raimondo are vying to be the governor who made free college happenand both their plans are running into resistance from their own partys lawmakers. Some of the controversy was to be expected: Its no surprise that fiscal conservatives think its another costly social program with uncertain returns. Other legislators and educators worry about how it will affect enrollment at state schools. The surface simplicity of free college is one of its great calling cards. But Democrats are finding its not so simple. But for liberals, the legislative battles have exposed a series of tricky policy trade-offs that cut to the heart of a larger national debate: What kind of progress should Democrats be fighting for? Should a new social program benefit everyone equally, like Social Security, or help low-income families the most? And how valuable is tuition relief, really, if the state doesnt help students with other college expenses, like room and board and books? The surface simplicity of the whole idea is one of its great calling cards: Free college. How complicated could that be? The debates in New York and Rhode Island have sometimes been acrimonious and divisive. But thats far from a bad thing: Democrats will ultimately have to hash through some complicated questions to forge a viable free-college model for the country. Why not start in New York and Rhode Island?\n\nAlex Carp at New York Magazine writesCan the Democrats Still Count on a Demographic Advantage?\n\nFifteen years ago, political demographer Ruy Teixeira offered the Democratic Party a blueprint for how to win elections for a generation or more. In The Emerging Democratic Majority, the hugely influential book he co-wrote with John Judis in 2002, the duo argued, based on data-heavy analyses, that the Democratic Party could thrive by cultivating a voter base of women, racial and ethnic minorities, and postindustrial professionals. A new progressive era was not only possible but likely, if liberals focused on surfing the wave of demographic trends, which were slowly eroding the electoral power of working- and middle-class whites. The strategy seemed vindicated when a coalition of exactly these groups brought Barack Obama to the White House in 2008. In the wake of Donald Trumps victory last November  precisely the sort of thing an emerging Democratic majority was supposed to prevent  party strategists and commentators have begun to revisit that faith in the political power of demographic change, and in the argument that Teixeira and Judis presented.\n\nx Opinion: What is the most efficient thing you  just one concerned person  can do about global warming? https://t.co/2WbpWI3EVR  The New York Times (@nytimes) March 30, 2017\n\nDave Johnson at the Campaign for Americas Future writesTrump Nominates Alligator Clayton To Run SEC:\n\nSaying on the campaign trail that Wall Street banks and hedge funds are \"getting away with murder,\" President Trump promised voters he would \"drain the swamp\" and \"reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.\" [...] That was then, this is now.

EPA. In that case, spearheaded by a dozen states, the court rejected the Bush-era EPAs reasoning for why it could not regulate greenhouse gas emissions for motor vehicles, and ordered it to determine whether carbon dioxide endangered public health and welfare. In 2009, the EPA made an endangerment finding that was upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nSo long as the endangerment finding stands, then the EPA is required to regulate greenhouse gases from any number of sources, including existing power plants, said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n\n[EPA chief Scott] Pruitt thus has a menu of legally imperfect options. Most end with him being sued by the same coalition of states and environmental groups now supporting the planwhich will make for a piquant reversal given that, in his last job as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA fourteen times, with four challenges to the Clean Power Plan alone.\n\nLegally, Pruitts safest bet is to write a new rule that is less effective and less expensive for the industry, said Burgerlike the Clean Power Plan repeal and replace. But to make a rule that holds up in court, Pruitt will have to do something he currently seems loath to do: Admit that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming and that the EPA has the right to regulate it. Given his climate-denying ideology, he may try to repeal the endangerment finding itself.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Democrats troubled by Pruitts deep ties to fossil fuel industries pressed him on this precise point. Pruitt told Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, I believe that the EPA...has obligations to address the CO2 issue.

A very photo heavy diary: Yesterday, I went to Valley of the Gods in Bears Ears National Monument, located in Southeastern Utah.

Valley of the Gods is located a bit further west than the area that diary focused on, though still (just less than) 20 miles from Bluff. Valley of the Gods, or VotG going forward, has been a named destination for many years. However, prior to being protected by inclusion in the newly established Bears Ears National Monumentit was completely unprotected by any Federal designation. Thankfully, by being included in Bears Ears this gorgeous valley is now protected from development. Fwiw, there are no gas wells in VotG, although the entire area around it that is not within Bears Ears is chocked full of gas and/or oil extraction wells. And to be clear, when an area is designated a National Monument, all current leases, be they acreage for cattle grazing or mining/extraction operationsremain. What becoming a National Monument means is that no further leases will be issued (among other things), not that any current lease is cancelled.\n\nO is for ostrich.\n\nowktree writesDaily Bucket: O is For...Welcome to the fifteenth entry in our Backyard Science Alphabet series.

As is our duty, we rounded up the coverage for our readers. As the event is barely worth mentioning, well keep it short: Lamar Smith, chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, reportedly acknowledged that the committee is now a tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community, according to Sciences Jeffrey Mervis. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma declared , Obamas war on fossil fuels is temporarily over. He also took a page out of Trumps  truthful hyperbole playbook, saying the Waters of the United States rule that Trump rolled back would have allowed the EPA to regulate all land and water uses in America. Willie Soon, famed for his undisclosed fossil fuel funding, said that the IPCC was an anti-science movement for which he would create a place in hell.\n\nClimateDenierRoundup writesUnderstanding the Mercer-naries of the Trump Administration: What do Donald Trump, Heartlands Denial-palooza, and Breitbart have in common, besides their obviously hostile relationship with the truth? They all share a common funding source: the embodiment of every stereotype about socially awkward computer nerds who get rich and became eccentric, Robert Mercer. The reclusive, model-train loving billionaire got the Jane Mayer treatment in the latest New Yorker , a long read that is well worth poring over. The piece provides a window into the anti-government, the Clintons are murderers type of conspiracy-driven libertarian worldview motivating those who brought money and organization to Trumps campaign. The Mercers also fund Heartland . The Washington Post reports that, while attending last weeks Heartland conference, Roberts daughter Rebekah chatted up Heartland President Joe Bast. Robert, true to his antisocial persona, sat silently eating his salad. Given Trumps win and the anticipation over yesterdays executive order (the fact sheet for which was based in part on a debunked, coal-funded study ), one would expect the deniers to have been celebrating bigly.

If that doesnt sound reasonable to you, then take it up with the Trump administration. They think its just dandy, according to a report in The Guardian. Harvard engineers who launched the worlds biggest solar geoengineering research program may get a dangerous boost from Donald Trump, environmental organizations are warning. Under the Trump administration, enthusiasm appears to be growing for the controversial technology of solar geo-engineering, which aims to spray sulphate particles into the atmosphere to reflect the suns radiation back to space and decrease the temperature of Earth. Never mind those pesky solar panels, people! No need to climb up on rooftops and risk injury from falls when you can let the government, and our friends in industry, do the solar work for you.

I squirmed that my company was willing to spend $10k for me to go to an eight person dinner with the governor of my state (not Texas, this was later after Id climbed a few more rungs of the ladder) to convince him that we shouldnt have to put pollution controls on our coal burning power stations.

But, as is typical of Trump, the rhetoric in the order will not match the changes that actually occur. In fact, as Nancy Letourneau points out, his chances of rewriting Obamas rules on curbing carbon emissions are actually quite slim . The real target of Trumps executive order is coal country and the order makes it seem like it will roll back the requirement that existing power plants limit greenhouse gas emissions. The existing rule spelled doom for coal-fired plants and made it prohibitive to build new ones. So Trumps order is intended to give those coal-fired plants new life. Except its not going to happen. The first hurdle that Trump will have to clear is that the rules themselves are caught up in existing litigation. The EPA would have to get permission from the DC Court of Appeals to revisit the rules at all. Assuming that permission is granted, however, means the EPA would then have to justify why the original rules would need to be changed.\n\nTevye writesTrump Signals End Of U.S. Dominance in Climate Change Battle.

PBS Frontline has more on the book and reaction to it: The Heartland initiative dismisses multiple studies showing scientists are in near unanimous agreement that humans are changing the climate. Even if human activity is contributing to climate change, the book argues, it would probably not be harmful, because many areas of the world would benefit from or adjust to climate change. The campaign elicited immediate derision from the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a nonprofit in Oakland, California that monitors climate change education in classrooms. Its not science, but its dressed up to look like science, said NCSE executive director Ann Reid.

Second, please explain how it's meaningless that that warming not only correlates quite smoothly with the steep increase in radiative-forcing CO2 in the troposphere in, say, the last century, as well as being mathematically and demonstrably well-fitted through multiple well-sourced and peer-reviewed analyses to prove that such other forcings as volcanoes, solar activity, aerosols, and other niceties can't account for the same global temperature rises.

There are a number of policies from the Obama administration that the president believes should be reviewed, a senior White House official said during a press call on Monday night. Some of them should be taken off the books immediately, to the extent that we can.  In the order, the president asks for more than just a repeal and rework of the Clean Power Plan, Obamas signature domestic climate policy and Trumps preferred scapegoat for the declining coal industry. The order also seeks to repeal rules regarding fracking on public lands, and coal leases on federal lands. It orders agencies to reconsider the Social Cost of Carbon and rescinds an Obama-era order requiring agencies to consider the impact of climate change in their environmental permitting process. And it undoes key executive actions meant to make the federal government  and communities  more prepared to handle the consequences of climate change.\n\nClevelandAttorney writesWhy the CPP and EPA Matter to OUR FAMILIES (pics plz share): This is my son.

Cities especially have to deal with the reality of climate change effects that are already happening. Hurricanes like Katrina and storms like Sandy have made municipalities aware of the necessity for preparation in the certainty of a weather emergency, whatever it may be. They have discovered that emergency preparedness and civil defense are generally climate adaptation and the best of them can be climate mitigation too.\n\nThis is why Ive been saying Solar IS Civil Defense for many years now.

This deliberate attempt to destroy the quality of life for future generations will be called the Energy Independence Executive Order.

The reason thats important to mining companies is that mountaintop removal is the cheapest way to mine in the Appalachians. And the reason its the cheapest is that it takes fewer people. By enabling MTR, Trump allows producers that use it to undercut producers working with methods that both employ more people and are less harmful to the environment. In effect, his orders force mining companies to use more polluting methods or get out of the business.\n\nSad as the results of these orders are, even more heartbreaking is that people are still hoping it will help.\n\nIt came as little surprise that Mr. Trump, who was flanked by coal miners as he signed the executive order in Washington, won Appalachia by huge margins in November.

There are zero in the planning stages. There are zero being proposed.\n\nThe coal industry cant make a comeback, because theres simply nowhere else to sell any coal. In fact, even with Trump in office signing away environmental laws left and right, more coal-fired plants are closing. The shrinking market that remains will be dominated not by coal from the Ohio and West Virginia miners that flanked Trump, but from Wyoming, where thick seams, high automation, and economies of scale make coal much less costly to produce.\n\nRobert Murray, who lined his miners up to serve as props for both Trump and Mitt Romney, was careful to insinuate a rebirth of the industry if they could just shake off Obama. But now\n\nRobert E. Murray, an outspoken mining executive, recently suggested tempered expectations for a coal rebound. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, cautioned in November that the potential impact of a regulatory rollback would be hard to tell.\n\nIts likely there will be some bounce in the market this year as power plants reduce large on-site inventories and drive a temporary increase in demand, but that effect is expected to be minor and short-livedespecially since another record warm winter reduced electrical demands.\n\nCoal mining will continue  at a smaller scale, and mostly in the west.

Standing in the way is an array of green activist groups ready to take the regime to court and, if necessary, to engage in civil disobedience.\n\nMarianne Lavelle at InsideClimate News reports:\n\n\"Whenever Congress or TransCanada or its lobbyists have tried to create shortcuts to expedite approval, it tended to backfire and cause the process to be longer,\" said Anthony Swift, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Canada project. \"We're seeing that again with the [administration] making a decision on the basis of an incredibly outdated environmental review.\" [...] Environmentalists will argue that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the change in oil economics and new scientific analysis are the kind of \"significant new circumstances\" that require a supplemental environmental analysis. Under NEPA the public comment process takes at least 75 days and often takes months or years. \"It's very, very difficult to imagine a legally defensible decision on the basis of this review\" by the Trump administration, Swift said. \"And if we see a legally indefensible approval, we will challenge that.\"\n\nHeres Bill McKibben:\n\nThis project is going to be fought at every turn, said Bill McKibben, a co-founder of the climate-activism group 350.org and one of the first organizers of anti-Keystone protests. Theres nothing static about this project. In the six or seven years since we started fighting it, the price of a solar panel has fallen 75 percent. [...] McKibben and other leaders outlined an all-out assault on every aspect of the pipelines completion. The fight has taken on higher stakes. During the early 2010s, global oil price were high. Its expensive to drill in the Albertan tar sands, but the overall cost of oil would have made it feasible even if no pipeline was built. But as the price of crude has fallen around the world, the Albertan tar sands will likely only now get drilled if theres a cheap way to transport their haullike an extra-large pipeline, for instance.\n\nSara Shor, a campaign manager with 350.org, said the organization and its allies will \"raise hell at the national level\" and recruit millions of people to fight the pipeline. Some of the results of that recruiting are likely to be obvious at next months town hall meetings when Congress leaves Washington for their home turf during the spring recess. \"Were going to continue to make Keystone XL a political issue and push every elected official to come out against this project.\"\n\nThe most immediate hurdle for Keystone XLs builder, TransCanada, is Nebraska. The company was forced to change its original 271-mile route in the state away from the fragile sand hills. Authorities there are now considering whether the new route should be approved. When informed of this, Trump said Nebraska will be good, and that he would call up Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts about it. But its not the governor who makes the decision about pipeline routes, its the Public Service Commission. The PSC may not get around to deciding until September.\n\nIf the members favor the pipeline, it still wont be the end of Keystone XLs obstacles in the Cornhusker state.\n\nSays Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Alliance of Nebraska, which has been battling the pipeline for years:\n\nFamilies along the proposed route and our drinking water are Trumps political football. No announcement from the White House can distract from Trumps constant lying. Keystone XL will use foreign steel, to transport foreign oil, to the foreign export market all while using eminent domain to take land away from farmers and ranchers. Keystone XL is and always will be all risk and no reward. Kind of like Pres. Trump.\n\nTom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, says:\n\nToday, the fight to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline begins anew  and Donald Trump should expect far greater resistance than ever before. Indigenous people are rising up and fighting like our lives, sovereignty, and climate depend on it  because they do. Over and over again, weve seen Trump choose the profits of his billionaire friends over our sovereign, treaty and human rights. It shows a clear disregard of our tribal rights to consent and self-determination, and it is unacceptable in this day and age.\n\nDeveloping tar sands is expensive and requires a consistent output over many years to produce a reasonable return on investment. At nearly $100 a barrel, there is a lot of room to make big profits. But with oil prices now hovering just below the $50 mark, some tar sands deposits just arent worth the effort although companies with the easiest-to-extract reserves can get by at around $35 a barrel.\n\nConsequently, as activists plan their strategy for keeping Albertas petroleum in the ground, some of the worlds largest oil companies are pulling out of their tar sands investments. Royal Dutch Shell recently took a $2 billion write-down and abandoned its 80,000 barrel-a-day operation in Carmon Creek. And ExxonMobil Corp. and Conoco Phillips have between them abandoned a combined total of 5 billion barrels of tar sands reserves, knocking $250 billion valuation off their books.\n\nTrumps pro-fossil fuel actions have brought dismay to environmental advocates, but all those recent strokes of his pen arent the end of the fight. They just mark a new beginning.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/29/1648393/-Trump-s-greenlight-to-Keystone-XL-and-his-move-against-Clean-Power-Plan-renews-activist-resistance#read-more", "date": "2017/3/29"}, {"text": "U.S. citizen kids eligible for food assistance programs may be going hungry because their immigrant parents have canceled their enrollment out of fear of falling onto the radar of Donald Trumps deportation force:\n\nOfficials at Manna Food Center in Montgomery County, Md., report that about 20 percent of the 561 families they have helped apply for food stamps, or SNAP benefits, in the past few months have asked that their cases be closed.\n\nMaria Chavez, an outreach worker for Manna, says her immigrant clients are scared, especially if they're unauthorized parents getting SNAP benefits for their eligible American children.\n\n\"They say, 'I want to close my food stamp.'

Let's start with the fact that this is a stolen seat. By all rights, the only person who should be considered for the court is Merrick Garland, President Obama's highly qualified and completely noncontroversial nominee who was blockaded by Republicans in an unprecedented and unprincipled display of partisanship. You don't like the idea that maybe it's tit-for-tat and you don't want to look petty. Get over it.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons based in Gorsuch's person, however, if Democrats need them. Like the fact that Gorsuch is a right-wing extremist so bought-into right-wing extremism that he uses \"Democrat\" as an adjective. That's an implicit tip-off to anyone paying attention that he is a supremely political actor and will be serving the far-right before serving the constitution. He's an ideologue and will rule as one. There's also little indication that Gorsuch will be an independent actor whenand it's increasingly looking like it will be when and not ifthe court has to weigh in on a constitutional crisis created by popular vote loser Donald Trump.\n\nFurther, any senator who is worried about justifying a filibuster vote to their constituents only needs one story to justify their votethe story of Alphonse Maddin, the \"frozen trucker.\" Gorsuch actually ruled that Maddin was justifiably fired by his employer when he disobeyed an order so that he could save himself from freezing to death. Gorsuch was in the minority in that decision, because it was an extreme position to take, but that's who Gorsuch is. Any senator will be able to relate that story to a constituent to justify his or her vote to block Gorsuch.\n\nAs of now, as many as 30 senators, out of the 41 necessary to block the confirmation or force McConnell to end the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees, and there are more lining up against Trump and Gorsuch every day. There are a few holdoutsJoe Manchin (WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (ND) are the likeliest to wimp out.\n\nAnother is approaching this from a position of longstanding, and anachronistic principle. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has said he is \"not inclined\" to filibuster, but needs answers from Gorsuch to his written questions before deciding on whether to join the growing majority of his colleagues to filibuster.\n\nWith all due respect to the senator, what more information could he possibly need to decide to stand up against this nominee and this president? The answers he gets from Gorsuch won't be any more definitive or more helpful than what he got in the hearings. Gorsuch is not going to put anything in writingjust as he wasn't going to say it out loud in a hearingthat will inform or elucidate his positions. There's enough information now. Sen.

And according to recent reports, the GOP Congress may stiff him on the cash for it, too.\n\nDonald Trump is incredibly dangerous, but hes also incredibly stupid and careless.

No longer tethered together by their favorite scapegoat, Barack Obama, their ship has become unmoored amid a fleet of sinking campaign promises. The one thing on which they seem to agree is that they have to give their base someone to latch on to lest their glaring incompetency become the focus of 2018.

[...] Warren, a household name and an unapologetic liberal, is an easy choice. Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist in Washington, DC, says going after Warren is part of the Republican playbook for 2020, as well. \"Always define your opponent before your opponent can define you,\" he says.\n\nThe notion that the GOP will be able to do anything whatsoever to distract voters from the governing meltdown they are now witnessing at the hands of Republicans is laughable. \"Hey voters, forget that Russia-installed marionette occupying the White House and our health reform catastrophe seven years in the makinglook over there at Elizabeth Warren. Now, that's one scary chick!\" Gimme a break. Republicans releasing digital ads as early as last month is proof positive that they have to get a jump on campaigning because theyve already hit the wall on governing.\n\nAnd if they think Warren will be a disaster in red states, that's certainly not what Missouri Democrat Jason Kander found during his 2016 Senate run.

He has released a budget that would slash education, environmental protection, medical research, and more while further bloating the defense budget. He has weakened consumer protections. He is moving to reverse an important clean water rule. He signed a bill effectively saying that federal contracts can go to labor law violators. He worked hard to pass a disastrous, unpopular healthcare bill. And as that bills failure shows, even if Democrats worked with Trump (which they should not) and came up with something they liked, it would still have to get past congressional Republicans.\n\nAlso, Donald Trump cannot go two sentences without lying.

Although the White House had wanted Congress to fold an initial outlay for Trumps wall into a government funding bill, the GOP's governance meltdown has necessitated Democratic help in keeping the government funded by the April 28 deadline. Democrats, in turn, have threatened to withhold their votes if any funding for the wall is included in that bill.\n\nSenate Democrats are prepared to fight this all the way, Sen. Chuck Schumer told attendees of a National Council of La Raza event Tuesday.\n\nIn order to avoid yet another GOP #fail in the form of a government shutdown, Republican leadership is weighing the idea of separating money for the wall from the government funding bill. Politico writes:\n\nWhile no decision has been made by GOP leadership, Republican lawmakers may decide to decouple the two to avoid a confrontation with Democrats. If they do, the chances of getting Trumps wall funding passed this spring become slim. It remains to be seen, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) in an interview. What I would like to see is a plan for how the money would be spent and a good faith discussion about what border security is really composed of. We havent had that. Asked about the prospects for a lapse in government funding, Cornyn was definitive: Theres not going to be a shutdown.\n\nTrump had aimed to get about $1.4 billion for the wall out of the initial funding bill with more to follow in a subsequent funding measure. But it turns out building the $20- to $50-billion wall is equally as unpopular as the man who insists on building it, with only 35 percent of American taxpayers supporting the wall, especially if taxpayers are footing the bill. That leaves very little incentive for Congressional Republicans to supply funding for an unpopular project being pushed by a pr*sident with abysmal approval ratings.\n\nThis little funding snafu is going to absolutely tweak Trump, who's been obsessed with building the wall since the day he announced his candidacy.

In a conversation with News-Times editor Jacqueline Smith, Lembo said he'd make a \"preliminary decision\" this spring, which Smith interpreted as Lembo saying he'd create an exploratory committee. Smith also characterized Lembo, who recently met with the News-Times' editorial board, as sharply critical of the current incumbent governor, fellow Democrat Dan Malloy, who still hasn't announced whether he'll seek a third term.\n\nMalloy's indecision has kept Lembo in limbo (we had to say it), and the rest of the Democratic Party, too. But as Smith notes, would-be contenders can't wait around much longer. In order to qualify for matching funds from the state, candidates need to raise $250,000 in donations of $100 or less, a tall task. So far, several Republicans and one Democrat, Middletown Mayor Dan Drew, have already gotten to work doing just that, regardless of what Malloy opts to do. For his part, Malloy says he'll also make up his mind this spring, after the state's budget is completed.\n\n IL-Gov: Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has incredibly deep pockets and has already thrown $50 million of his own money behind his re-election bid, but that isn't stopping the RGA-backed group State Solutions from airing two new TV spots praising the governor's work on the state's budget amid a protracted impasse with the Democratic-controlled state legislature. Both spots features Rauner talking about his plans to keep taxes down while attacking supposed career politicians who just want to kick the can down the road. However, there's no word on the size of the buy, and at this early phase in the election cycle, there's a good chance these ads are aimed at the press rather than voter eyeballs.\n\nThe Democratic field to take on Rauner has quickly grown increasingly crowded, with state Sen. Daniel Biss, businessman and Kennedy family scion Chris Kennedy, Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, and Madison County Regional Schools Superintendent Bob Daiber having already announced. Additionally, billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker recently formed an exploratory committee and seems likely to enter the race, while Chicago City Treasurer Kurt Summers is considering a run, too. Rauner, Pritzker, and Kennedy could all self-fund untold millions, so this contestin what's already an expensive statecould quickly become a money pit.\n\n NJ-Gov: Fairleigh Dickinson University's latest poll of the June 6 primary mirrors what just about every other survey of the race has shown: Both parties have a front runner, but with the number of undecided voters sky-high, each race is uncertain. On the Democratic side, former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy leads with 23 percent, while no other candidate tops 4 points. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno leads for Republicans with 24 percent, while no other Republican exceeds 5 percent. Both matchups are similar to the pollster's last survey in January.\n\nThe poll didn't reveal any general election trial heats, but the eventual Republican nominee will likely be hard-pressed to distance him- or herself from GOP Gov. Chris Christie's atrocious 20-72 disapproval rating.\n\n NM-Gov: Local analyst Joe Monahan reports that former Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010, is giving her support in next year's gubernatorial race to Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a fellow Democrat. Denish backed Grisham's first House bid in 2012, so the move isn't too surprising, though another Denish ally, state Attorney General Hector Balderas, is also considering a bid, so if he runs, it'll be without Denish's endorsement. One other Democrat, state Sen. Joseph Cervantes, is also in the race for this open seat, while no Republicans have announced yet.\n\n NV-Gov: Back in January, columnist Steve Sebelius reported that wealthy businessman Steve Cloobeck had told him that he was going to run for governor, but Cloobeck has yet to say so himself. In fact, in a new piece in the New York Times on wealthy \"celebrity\" candidates, Cloobeck said he was \"still deciding,\" in the newspaper's words, and didn't offer any sort of timetable.\n\nCloobeck is the founder and former CEO of Diamond Resorts, a company that sells timeshares, has appeared on the reality TV show \"Undercover Boss,\" and loves to lambaste both parties. However, he's quick to cut off any comparisons to Trump, saying, \"I gave away $6.8 million last year, and my taxes are paid current.\" Still, he'd be a very tough candidate for progressives to love (Cloobeck previously said he wants to hire Republican plays-a-pollster-on-TV Frank Luntz), though so far, no other Democrats are running for this open seat. The Republican field has yet to coalesce either, though state Attorney General Adam Laxalt seems likely to get in.\n\n OK-Gov: State Auditor Gary Jones is the latest Republican to say he's considering a run for governor next year, when GOP Gov. Mary Fallin will be termed out of office. However, Jones doesn't sound particularly amped up about the possibility. He says that he could also run for state Senate, which seems like quite a step down, or perhaps he'll do nothing at all, saying that \"maybe that best position for me is going home and feeding cows and spending time with grandkids.\"\n\nFor Democrats, another new name has also surfaced. In response to an online effort to draft him into the race, former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson says he's thinking about a bid. Edmondson served as attorney general for 16 years before losing the 2010 primary for governor by less than 1 point to then-Lt. Gov. Jari Askins. That might not have been such a bad thing, though, as Askins went on to get crushed by Fallin, losing 60-40 in the Republican wave.\n\nSo far, no candidates on either side have actually entered the race yet, though for the GOP, wealthy attorney Gary Richardson has formed an exploratory committee and Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb has said he's \"leaning\" toward a run. For Democrats, state House Minority Leader Scott Inman has also said he's considering a bid. Republicans will be heavily favored to retain the governorship in this dark red state.\n\n PA-Gov: Paul Mango, one of several wealthy businessmen potentially in the mix for next year's GOP gubernatorial primary, reportedly told a group of Republican county commissioners that he is indeed running. One of them, Berks County Commissioner Christian Leinbach, actually went on the record to tell PoliticsPA that Mango said he would \"officially announce after the primary,\" which, assuming Leinbach is referring to this year's primary, would be some time after May 16. (This is why we put together our helpful 2017 election calendar!)\n\nMango, though, still has yet to comment himself. And so far, the only Republican formally in the race against Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is state Sen. Scott Wagner, who, like, Mango, is also rich. (So, for that matter, is Wolf.)\n\n VA-Gov: Christopher Newport University returns to survey the field for Virginia's June 13 gubernatorial primary, and finds Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former Rep. Tom Perriello deadlocked at 26 percent apiece for Team Blue. That represents a sizable upswing for Perriello after CNU's February poll placed Northam ahead 26-15.\n\nSome in the media have tried to portray the Northam-Perriello contest as a redux of the 2016 presidential primary, with Northam supposedly embodying Hillary Clinton and the an allegedly centrist establishment, while Perriello plays left-wing insurgent Bernie Sanders. However, this poll simply doesn't support the notion. Northam does lead with Clinton voters by a 34-25 margin while Perriello is ahead with Sanders supporters 32-21, but those differences are simply nowhere near as polarized as one would expect if each candidate's base aligned heavily with the 2016 primary. Indeed, as we've detailed previously, there's far more nuance to both candidates' ideology and their relationship with the party establishment than this simplistic portrayal would suggest.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, former RNC chair and 2014 Senate nominee Ed Gillespie dominates the field with 38 percent compared to 11 percent for Prince William County Supervisor Corey Stewart and 10 percent for state Sen. Frank Wagner. With this many undecided voters, both nominations are still up for grabs, but Gillespie's rivals only have so much time left to close the gap.\n\nHouse\n\n MN-01: Democratic Rep. Tim Walz's announcement that he would run for governor on Monday has opened up the floodgates for potential candidates seeking to succeed him in the House. Republican Jim Hagedorn nearly knocked off Walz in what would have been a shocking upset in 2016, no doubt thanks to Donald Trump carrying this southern Minnesota district by a surprisingly large 53-38 margin, but Hagedorn could have plenty of company as he wages a third consecutive bid to become Team Red's nominee in 2018. (Hagedorn, incidentally, is the son of former 1980s-era Rep. Tom Hagedorn.)\n\nThe Post-Bulletin queried several potential Republican candidates, several of whom seemed to think that their chances of succeeding would be much better without Walz. Olmsted County Republican Party Chair Aaron Miller previously won the Republican Party's official endorsement in 2014 but lost to Hagedorn in the primary that year. Miller sharply criticized Hagedorn for failing to beat Walz last year and says he's considering running again, although he added that he might defer to a stronger challenger. Meanwhile, state Sens. Carla Nelson, Jeremy Miller, and Dave Senjem all refused to rule out a bid, while state Rep. Nels Pierson maintained that he was open to a potential campaign.\n\nDemocrats don't have quite as deep a bench in this ancestrally Republican yet historically swingy seat, but state Sen. Nick Frentz said he'd \"consider\" running. The Post-Bulletin states that party insiders have also pointed to former Walz campaign manager and ex-state Rep. Terry Morrow as a potential contender.\n\n SC-05: Former Republican state Rep. Ralph Norman, who resigned last month to concentrate on his campaign for the upcoming special election in South Carolina's 5th Congressional District, has released two new TV ads. Cueing off the theme of \"spring cleaning,\" Norman asks voters to send him to Washington to institute term limits and pass a balanced budget amendment in both spots. Norman faces several other candidates in the May 2 GOP primary, which will be followed by a runoff on May 16 if no one takes a majority in the first round. Republicans are heavily favored to hold this seat in the June 20 special.\n\nGrab Bag\n\n Demographics: William Frey of the Brookings Institution has an interesting post on geographic clustering, and it doesn't go the way you might think. It turns out that if you base your analysis on counties, then it may be the Republicans who are the ones who are clustered, specifically in the nation's rural counties. There are 177 million people living in the counties that went for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and only 146 million in counties that went for Donald Trump. That's a very anomalous result, one that didn't even happen the last time we had an Electoral College mismatch: In 2000, 149 million lived in George Bush counties and 133 million lived in Al Gore counties.\n\n(If you're familiar with the recent work of Daily Kos Elections alumnus Xenocrypt, you actually wouldn't be that surprised, though. Xenocrypt made a similar argument back in January, pointing out that a disproportionately large number of people lived in Clinton counties subsumed within Trump states.)\n\nWhat's helpful in Frey's post is when he starts breaking the Clinton-county and Trump-county populations down along various other demographic lines. You can see how Clinton counties lean more toward the higher-income, the never-married, the foreign-born, the non-white, and the college-educated. In particular, what's cool (and what should be terrifying to Republicans regarding future elections) are the graphs at the end of the article that divide the population down by both age and race. Trump counties are disproportionately not just white but also elderly, while the single-largest bucket by far is people who are under age 15, who are non-white, and who live in current Clinton counties. In other words, these are the people who'll be entering and reshaping the electorate in the next decade.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/29/1648217/-Morning-Digest-The-Club-for-Growth-goes-after-Karen-Handel-in-Georgia-special-election#read-more", "date": "2017/3/29"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, March 29, 2017\n\nNote: This morning's poolside entertainment is Frau Kloppenheimer and her famous chainsaw-juggling orangutans.

Four years after the Rick Snyder administration switched the water supply in Flint, Michigan and started poisoning its own citizens with lead from corroded pipes, The Law has finally brought its gavel down like a ton of bricksor, rather, several tons of steel pipe:\n\nThe state of Michigan will set aside $97 million for lead or galvanized steel water lines to be replaced in the City of Flint, according to a settlement filed Monday in US District Court. Soon to be replaced. But not soon enough. The state will cover the cost of replacing water lines---the pipes that connect household plumbing to the main distribution pipe running beneath the street---for at least 18,000 Flint households by 2020, according to the settlement, which resulted from a lawsuit over lead-tainted water in the city. The state will also monitor the water quality of a sampling of homes after the replacement, and hire an independent third party to test and monitor a sampling of at least 100 homes for at least three years.\n\nTriple cheers to the three groups that brought the suit and forced Snyder to finally atone (financially anyway, since his lack of a soul will never allow him to atone morally) for one of the biggest \"deliberate blunders\" a sitting governor has ever perpetrated on his people: Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the ACLU of Michigan, and the Natural Resource Defense Council. They showed extraordinary leadership. Or, to be more accurate, extraordinary \"no-lead\"-ership.\n\nJEERS to leaving the planet worse off than when you found it. Yesterday our so-called \"president\" whipped out his Crayolas and put his X on an executive order that rolls back a whole slate of President Obama's green initiatives, including \"emissions rules for power plants, limits on methane leaks, a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and the use of the social cost of carbon to guide government actions.\" No sugar-coating it: it's bad. Trump cares not a whit if he's hastening the demise of planet Earth or directly causing the pollution-related deaths of thousands of people. (Let's hope one of them is him.) But being the doe-eyed optimist I am, I take some heart in the assessment by Vox that, in addition to the avalanche of lawsuits that will tie the administration up in knots, there's this:\n\nTrumps executive order cant halt all climate progress. Emissions would still decline gently in the coming years, thanks to market forces and policies that Trump cant really touch. For instance: Many US utilities are increasingly moving away from coal and toward cleaner sources such as gas, wind,and solar---that shift will almost certainly continue no matter what the White House does, since its being driven by more than EPA rules. And states like New York and California will keep pursuing their own more stringent climate policies.I I like the green line better. What Trump can do, however, is halt any momentum that may have been building toward deep decarbonization.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is jus' an itty-bitty li'l thang. And when he stands on a stack of phone books (ask your parents) behind a lectern and bellows threats in a voice that sounds like Rosco P. Coltrane sucking on helium, it's a bit hard to take the racist gopher-elf hybrid seriously. Monday he blew into the White House press room and put cities that look favorably upon their immigrant residents on notice: Ahm comin' fo'yuh money, y'all. Well, okay---let's throw a dart at a U.S. map and pick a random city's reaction. [Thwap!!!] It lands on Chicago:\n\nAfter Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated the federal governments threat to block funding for so-called \"sanctuary cities, Mayor Rahm Emanuel doubled down on his own promise that Chicago will continue to welcome immigrants. [] Sister, you said a mouthful. It welcomed my grandfather 100 years ago, we continue to welcome entrepreneurs, immigrants,and I would just say think of it this way: Half the new businesses in Chicago and the state of Illinois come from immigrants,nearly half, he added. Half the patents at the University of Illinois come from immigrants, and so we want to continue to welcome people, welcome their ideas, welcome their families to the city of Chicago, who want to build the American dream for their children and their grandchildren.\n\nUgh. I feel nauseous. I just agreed with Rahm Emanuel.\n\nCHEERS to more March Madness! The NCAA thingamahoochie continues.

It was the first time the nation had a president who wasn't elected to the office. Tyler insisted that he possessed all the powers of his predecessor, and wisely refused to let Congress refer to him as \"acting president.\" (Although today were 100 percent justified in labeling our moron-in-chief the so-called president.) Historians recognize him for very little except a couple of treaties. But we'll give him points for saying something that'll make the Republican base get their teabags in a twist (from the book Rating the Presidents):\n\nTyler demonstrated a complete tolerance of other religions. His family opposed the bigotry of the nativist Know Nothing political movement, which espoused hatred and suspicion of immigrants, particularly the wave of Irish Catholics entering the country at the time.\n\nBut he was also made of Old South stuff, and later unwisely became the only U.S. President to join the Congress of the Confederacy.

President Trump and his majorities in the House and Senate had hoped to head out for their spring break celebrating the chest-thumping accomplishments of finally gutting President Barack Obamas health care law and installing a conservative Supreme Court justice. They were determined to show the American public: We got this. Instead, the health care legislation unraveled in mortifying fashion, leaving Republicans unable to follow through on their central argument for being put in power. They will probably get their Supreme Court justice. But the confirmation of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch is likely to require a partisan maneuver that will inflame the already tense Senate and make it even harder to accomplish anything legislatively on Capitol Hill. And this is before Republicans get to the always formidable jobs of funding the government and raising the debt limit  both tasks they have been loath to take on in the past.

The depiction of Obamacare as a many-tendriled monster strangling human liberty was not the GOPs instinctive, ideological reaction to the bill, but an outgrowth of a strategic choice the party made to deny Obama any claim to having forged consensus. This decision led to a number of awkward reversals, such as when GOP leaders and right-wing propagandists drove Senator Chuck Grassley from acknowledging a bipartisan consensus to have individual mandates to validating death-panel conspiracy theories in a matter of weeks. The upshots of adopting such an absolutist facade can be strung together into a fateful parable of sunk costs. Seven years later, it is still impossible for Republicans to admit that, contrary to their initial portrayal, Obamacare is simply what a market-oriented national health insurance system looks like. By closing off the one avenue by which transactional Republicans might forge a health care detente, people like Paul Ryan guaranteed the entire party an eventual reckoning with the basic idea that every American deserves affordable medical care. Rather than make the unpopular counterargument, and oppose the Affordable Care Act on the basis of ideological differences, Republicans adopted an unprincipled strategy of attacking and promising to remedy the laws every weaknesseven when their promises cut against conservative orthodoxy.\n\nx \"What ought to worry anybody caught up in all this is the Russian term mokroye delo ...\"#KremlinGate #realtalkhttps://t.co/wqzICQODp8  John Schindler (@20committee) March 28, 2017\n\nAndrew Sprung/NY Times:\n\nThe Democrats Next Move on Health Care Staring into the abyss of Republican intentions that produced this bill, a Democrat might daydream: What if there were a Republican bill that did not repeal the A.C.A.s revenue sources, did not repeal the Medicaid expansion and left states free to maintain the current marketplace structure?

But with better equipment.\n\nIn case you missed the news, Congress screwed us royally today. Its really the perfect 21st Century upgrade of the fascist state: a law that promotes profit obtained via theft and gives the government access to data it has no legitimate reason to be interested in. Ernesto Falcon at the Electronic Frontier Foundation tells it like it most unfortunately is in Repealing Broadband Privacy Rules, Congress Sides with the Cable and Telephone Industry:\n\nPutting the interests of Internet providers over Internet users, Congress today voted to erase landmark broadband privacy protections. If the bill is signed into law, companies like Cox, Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, and Verizon will have free rein to hijack your searches, sell your data, and hammer you with unwanted advertisements. Worst yet, consumers will now have to pay a privacy tax by relying on VPNs to safeguard their information. That is a poor substitute for legal protections. Make no mistake, by a vote of 215 to 205 a slim majority of the House of Representatives have decided to give our personal information to an already highly profitable cable and telephone industry so that they can increase their profits with our data. The vote broke along party lines, with Republicans voting yes, although 15 Republicans broke ranks to vote against the repeal with the Democrats. Should President Donald Trump sign S.J. Res. 34 into law, big Internet providers will be given new powers to harvest your personal information in extraordinarily creepy ways. They will watch your every action online and create highly personalized and sensitive profiles for the highest bidder. All without your consent. This breaks with the decades long legal tradition that your communications provider is never allowed to monetize your personal information without asking for your permission first. This will harm our cybersecurity as these companies become giant repositories of personal data. It won't be long before the government begins demanding access to the treasure trove of private information Internet providers will collect and store. While today is extremely disappointing, there is still tomorrow. Without a doubt Internet providers (with the exception of the small providers who stood with us) will engage in egregious practices, and we are committed to mobilizing the public to push back. EFF will continue the fight to restore our privacy rights on all fronts. We will fight to restore your privacy rights in the courts, in the states, in Washington, D.C., and with technology.

And Justice Department lawyers seem to know it.\n\nAfter rushing into court within 24 hours of the initial order blocking most of Trumps first Muslim ban attempt, government lawyers have been notably quiet since a federal judge in Hawaii dealt the latest blow to key portions of the Muslim ban.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department filed an immediate appeal to the order from a federal judge in Seattle halting the ban and it followed up several hours later with an emergency motion at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The three-judge appeals panel handed government lawyers a unanimous defeat. Now the Justice Department has gone from a sprint to a crawl in the Ninth Circuit, writes Josh Gerstein.\n\nBut when a federal judge in Hawaii issued a broad block on the new order March 15, just hours before it was set to kick in, there was no immediate appeal. In fact, nearly two weeks later, the Justice Department is still tangling with Honolulu U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson and has yet to take the issue back to the 9th Circuit.

In 2008, Salinas family received a condemnation notice offering them the same low, low price of $2,900. Others in Los Ebanos were mailed similar notices. But nature and time were on their side. Los Ebanos is squeezed into a bend in the Rio Grande, and lies entirely in the rivers floodplain. A treaty between the United States and Mexico forbids building any structures in the floodplain that could push floodwaters into surrounding communities. Salinas family held off on signing the condemnation letter. As time passed, building a wall in Los Ebanos seemed less likely, because of the treaty and because the Obama administration made wall-building less of a priority.\n\nCircumstances now, however, are a world away. DHS has since successfully lobbied to the International Boundary and Water Commission (which manages the treaty) to build a wall in the floodplain. And theres Trump. His wall isnt just disastrously unpopular with Americans overall, but even border residents think its a complete waste and prefer other forms of border security instead:\n\nAleida Garcia, Salinas cousin, said the government has increased security in the area by adding more surveillance, which she prefers to Trumps proposed 30-foot wall. Even if they build a wall, people will still come, said Garcia. Whats helped us tremendously and is less expensive is the technology  the aerostat balloons, the ground sensors and even boots on the ground.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Salinas and other border residents are considering taking Trump to familiar ground over the order: court.\n\nHer family is consulting a lawyer about its next steps. If other border landowners have the same reluctance to sell as Salinas, the government may have a long battle ahead to secure all the land necessary for the wall, given that the federal government doesnt own most of it. The nearly 2,000-mile southern border is composed of federal, state, tribal and private lands. There are 632 miles of federal or tribal land -- 33 percent -- and the other 67 percent, most of which is in Texas, is private or state-owned, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Washington Post points out that the president would need Congress to pass a bill to acquire the tribal lands for his wall.\n\nTrump may also face opposition from the same GOP Congress that handed him a whopper of a Trumpcare defeat last week:\n\nTrump hoped to jump-start construction of a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border with money in a must-pass government funding bill. But Democratic leaders are vowing to block any legislation that includes a single penny for the wall. With the GOP consumed by its own divisions, the White House and Hill Republicans will have to rely on Democratic votes to avoid a government shutdown next month in what would be another disaster for Trumps fledgling presidency. Republican leaders, wary of this, are considering a plan that would not directly tie the border wall money to the April 28 government funding deadline. Some Republican insiders worry that the president cannot afford another major legislative setback  and they believe a shutdown showdown would result in just that. While no decision has been made by GOP leadership, Republican lawmakers may decide to decouple the two to avoid a confrontation with Democrats. If they do, the chances of getting Trumps wall funding passed this spring become slim.\n\nSo much winning.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/28/1647827/-The-federal-government-is-trying-to-seize-private-land-from-Americans-for-Trump-s-wall#read-more", "date": "2017/3/28"}, {"text": "Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates\n\nMinutes after the White House released an unsigned statement Tuesday calling reporting that it had tried to muzzle Sally Yates entirely false, CBS tweeted a March 24 letter showing former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was told by current Justice Department officials that she needed White House consent in order to testify about her conversations with the Office of the Counsel to the President.\n\nYates lawyer sought permission from the Justice Department for her to testify about non-classified facts pertaining to her communications with the White House regarding concerns about the conduct of a senior official (likely Michael Flynn).

Chris Hall, who represents a seat around Sioux City in western Iowa, is also being encouraged to run statewide, while Davenport Alderman and retired Army Ranger Mike Matson says he'll decide by the end of the summer.\n\nJohnson County Supervisor Mike Carberry has been mentioned as a possible candidate, though there's no word how interested he is; Carberry could appeal to the Bernie Sanders supporters that Neiderbach is hoping to win over. State Sen. Janet Petersen has not ruled out a bid and she's gotten some attention for defending Planned Parenthood funding, but Rynard says she isn't touring the state like other prospective candidates. Finally, ex-state Sen. Jack Hatch, who lost the 2014 race to Branstad 59-37, is reportedly encouraging others to run, but doesn't seem to have said no himself.\n\n VA-Gov: Now that George W. Bush has returned to the fundraising circuit after his long exile, it's not a surprise to see him heading up a Dallas fundraiser for Ed Gillespie. Gillespie, who narrowly lost the 2014 Senate race to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner, headed the RNC during Dubya's presidency and later served as his Counselor to the President.\n\nGillespie faces two primary opponents in the June GOP primary: state Sen. Frank Wagner and Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart. Wagner hasn't raised much money since he entered the race last year, nor has he earned many influential endorsements. Meanwhile, Stewart's entire campaign seems to be an attempt to appeal to rabidly pro-Trump internet commenters. In addition to referring to Gillespie as a \"cuckservative\" without any prompting on Reddit, Stewart's allies doctored a Washington Post headline to attack his opponent. However, Stewart's fundraising has been awful and he barely registers in the polls. Stewart may think he's the Donald Trump of Virginia, but the original model doesn't appear to think much of him. Last year, Stewart was sacked as head of Trump's state campaign after he organized a demonstration outside the RNC to protest their tepid support for Trump.\n\n WI-Gov: Dane County Executive Joe Parisi recently said he'd decide if he'll challenge GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the next month, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel takes a look at some other potential contenders. Mark Bakken, the wealthy co-founder of HealthX Ventures, a health care venture fund, is mentioned, but there's no word on his interest. However, Assemblymember Dana Wachs is reportedly unlikely to run if Bakken gets in, though unnamed \"sources familiar with his thinking\" say Wachs is seriously considering getting in otherwise.\n\nThe paper also mentions Matt Flynn, who served as state party chair in the 1980s and lost his fourth and most recent bid for Congress in 2004, and Assemblyman Gordon Hintz, but there's also no word if either man is interested. Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, who lost the 2014 attorney general race 52-45, is reportedly planning for a statewide run for an unidentified office, while non-profit head Andy Gronik and state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout are considering. Ex-state Sen. Tim Cullen recently said that he's likely to get in, but Cullen is a weak fundraiser who has pissed off plenty of Democrats over the years.\n\nHouse\n\n ME-02: This rural northern Maine seat swung hard against Team Blue last year, going from 53-44 Obama to 51-41 Trump. Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin won his second term by a similar 55-45 margin, and he could have problems if this area swings the other way in 2018. The first Democrat we've heard express interest is construction company owner Jonathan Fulford, who narrowly lost to GOP state Senate President Mike Thibodeau in 2014 and 2016. Fulford, who was a Bernie Sanders backer last year, tells the Bangor Daily News that he's considering, and he \"wondered aloud if a Sanders-style campaign model built on small donations would be an option against Poliquin.\" Poliquin himself has not ruled out running for governor next year.\n\n MN-01: Democratic Rep. Tim Walz's decision to run for governor (see our MN-Gov item) opens up his southern Minnesota seat, which includes Rochester and Mankato. This district violently lurched from 50-48 Obama to 53-38 Trump, and it will likely be a top GOP target. However, as Daily Kos Elections' David Jarman shows, this area has been very politically divided for decades, so it's possible 2016 was just a temporary shift. As recently as the 2014 GOP wave, Democratic Sen. Al Franken carried the 1st 49-45 while he was winning statewide 53-43, while GOP gubernatorial nominee Jeff Johnson won the seat 48-45 as he was losing the election 50-45.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Roll Call's Simone Path mentions ex-state Rep. Terry Morrow, who served as Walz's campaign manager last cycle, as a potential candidate. Morrow was first elected in 2006, and he resigned just after he was re-elected without opposition in 2012 to take a new job. It's unclear if Morrow is interested in running to succeed his boss, and he has not said anything publicly yet. Roll Call also says that state Rep. Tina Liebling could run, though there's no indication if she's interested. Liebling has been considering running for governor and she will reportedly announce her plans this Sunday. Path also name-drops state Rep. Gene Pelowski and state Sen. Dan Sparks, but there's also no sign yet that either of them are considering.\n\nOn the Republican side, businessman Jim Hagedorn, whose father Tom Hagedorn left the House in the early 1980s, declared he was running last year. In 2014, Hagedorn defeated the national GOP's preferred candidate in the primary, but he raised very little money for his bid. Hagedorn attracted bad headlines when his old writings denigrating well, almost everyone, surfaced. (Sample: In 2002, he called Washington's two female U.S. senators, \"undeserving bimbos in tennis shoes.\") Both parties ignored the race, and Walz won 54-46. Hagedorn came back for a rematch in 2016, and he once again raised only a little cash and earned almost no outside help. Hagedorn unexpectedly lost just 50.3-49.6, but his near-upset was almost certainly more due to Trump's coattails than to the candidate's appeal.\n\nIt's very likely that national Republicans will want to shove Hagedorn aside, but it's not clear who will step up. So far, the only other Republican we've heard from is state Sen. Jeremy Miller, who has flirted with running for this seat in the past. Miller told MinnPost's Sam Brodey that Walz's decision not to seek re-election was a \"game changer,\" but Miller declined to say anything about his own plans. It's likely that we'll hear from more Republicans in the coming days and weeks.\n\n PA-03: House Democrats in Western Pennsylvania have recently had lousy luck after the region has trended steadily to the right and Republicans passed a brutal congressional gerrymander that left Team Blue with just a single seat there following the 2012 elections. However, former Erie Mayor Rick Filippi reportedly told GoErie.com's Pat Cuneo recently that he would consider running against GOP Rep. Mike Kelly in the 3rd District, which spans from Erie to just north of Pittsburgh.\n\nFilippi would likely face strong headwinds if he does run. Although ancestrally Democratic, this heavily white working-class district backed Trump by a crushing 61-35 spread, which itself was a big improvement upon Mitt Romney's already imposing 56-43 edge in 2012. While the former mayor of the largest city in the district is at least a serious candidate on paper, it remains to be seen whether even a strong campaign could put such a red seat into play.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/28/1647832/-Morning-Digest-Democratic-Rep-Tim-Walz-joins-the-race-for-Minnesota-governor#read-more", "date": "2017/3/28"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Tuesday, March 28, 2017\n\nNote: Today is Weed Appreciation Day.

But given the chance, the public---even fellow Republicans---would do just the opposite, according to a new poll out this week. [] Americas current mood. [T]he typical voter would cut defense spending by $41 billion. All told, that adds up to a nearly $100 billion gap between what the public wants to spend on defense, and what Donald Trump wants to spend on it.

Democrats would cut it by a whopping $81 billion.\n\nThe bloated golf-addict (13 rounds since inauguration day) with the Napoleon complex will, of course, dismiss these as fake numbers and charge ahead with his plan to scrap beloved domestic programs in favor of the carnage industry.

In short, his crap crapped bigger ones than the current crop of GOPretenders. But his heart finally gave out and he died on this date in 1969. Pay your respects here.

AlsoPaul Ryan is very bad at his job, and doesnt understand policy. Saying Ryan understands policy is a strong indication you do not. You know who did do it right? The Obama administration. Even Tom Cotton can tell you that. Republicans are now looking across the aisle with more than a little bipartisan curiosity. However, many of their constituents are still happy to dig the hole deeper, even when they bury themselves. Obviously, blue lies matter to them. Every kind of lie that works is a good lie for Donald. Is that because hes a real estate developer? Or because hes just a dick? Speaking of, Boris Epshteyn will be leaving his position of accurate representative of the Trump administration.

He had previously fallen slightly below Barack Obama's low point; he's now one tick lower than either Bill Clinton or Gerald Ford at their worst. [...] What's clear is that these terrible numbers coincide with what is normally the honeymoon period, and Trump remains far below every other president of the polling era at this point. [...] Everyone he deals with is going to be less likely to do what he wants. That ranges a lot depending on how their particular constituencies feel about him. Even for those who are most pro-Trump, the low overall approval numbers make it a bit less likely they'll do his bidding. And those who answer to groups which really hate him will be under increasing pressure to find ways to demonstrate their opposition. If that sounds like the unenthusiastic supporters and confident opposition Trump faced during the health-care debacle, that's correct -- so now imagine if he faces his next battles with even lower numbers.\n\nAaron Blake at The Washington Post explains the damage to Trumps brand among soft Trump supporters:\n\nPolls showed that many Republicans who voted for Trump did so despite their reservations about him  including his temperament and his comments about women, minorities and a disabled reporter. The counterarguments were always that they believed he could effect change in Washington and that he could be the dealmaker the federal government needed. The failure of the health-care bill calls both of those things into question. Well await more polling, but for now, the initial and limited polling we have suggests that Trumps already-damaged brand was further damaged last week. And after one legislative battle, hes in a uniquely poor position for a new president.\n\nKate Brannen at Newsweek points out the trouble in covering an administration that lies constantly:\n\nFor a candidate who promised voters that were going to win so much, youre going to get tired of winning, this cant be what he had in mind. What went well for the president? Amid all of this not winning, Trump and his team are actually achieving a lot of success in one area: making the press, and therefore the public, work really hard at keeping track of whats true and whats bogus. So far, their hard work is paying off: Trumps slanderous accusations and wild claims are being debunked, fact-checked and refuted right and left. But that effort is taking up energy, time and resourcesin newsrooms, on Capitol Hill and in peoples brains. Its exhausting, and there are opportunity costs for all of us.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times writes about the Trump administrations war on science:\n\nAgainst those lofty promises, his first budget blueprint is a cramped document that sacrifices American innovation to small-bore politics, shortchanging basic scientific research across the government  from NASA to the Department of Energy to the National Institutes of Health  in ways that can only stifle invention and undercut the nations competitiveness. Meanwhile, more than 40 top government science positions, including that of presidential science adviser, remain vacant. Some research cuts, particularly to the N.I.H., arent likely to make it past Congress. But they show Mr. Trumps lack of understanding of sciences role in national and domestic security, in protecting air and water and other resources and in preventing disease and lowering the cost of health care, which consumes one-quarter of the $3.7 trillion federal budget.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun turns to Republican attempts to sabotage the ACA:\n\nThe greatest danger facing the ACA is not that it will implode, explode or enter into a death spiral but that the Trump administration will seek to exacerbate its shortcomings. The administration has already been busy doing just that by reducing marketing and promotion of the program to get fewer people to sign up. Earlier this year, President Trump instructed the IRS not to reject 2016 tax returns that fail to indicate whether the individual has qualifying health insurance coverage, effectively letting people off the hook for the individual mandate. And there are probably dozens of other ways Republicans can sabotage Obamacare through the regulatory process or by simply reducing the Medicaid budget. At this point, it may be far too Pollyannaish to expect Democrats and Republicans to set aside their differences and come up with corrective legislation, but it shouldn't be too much to ask Republicans not to undermine it. Conservatives hated Social Security from the start as well (it was viewed as \"European\" socialism, sound familiar?), but aside from the occasional privatization pushes, the GOP isn't actively trying to make it explode or implode. This is what actual governance is about, and Washington's ruling party ought to give it a try. As Speaker Ryan conceded, \"Obamacare is the law of the land.\"\n\nSteve Rattner also writes about sabotaging Obamacare:\n\nRepublicans may have conceded defeat in their legislative effort to get rid of Obamacare, but their guerrilla war to achieve its demise remains underway. [] While Medicaid expansion cant collapse the way that the exchanges could, Mr. Price could diminish it by taking steps like allowing states to impose a work requirement on enrollees or to limit lifetime benefits. He could also water down the 10 essential benefits required for all policies by the law, like maternity care and mental health coverage.\n\nWe end todays roundup with Eugene Robinsons take on Trumps presidency:", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/28/1647952/-Abbreviated-pundit-roundup-Trump-s-poll-numbers-hit-new-low#view-story", "date": "2017/3/28"}, {"text": "Nigel Farage, the British politician known for his successful campaign to get the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, has teamed up with the backers of a campaign to split California into two separate states: a coastal state that would be dominated by liberal-dominated portion and an inland state that would be far more conservative.

There's a lot that the administration and Republicans can do to undermine the law because it has so many moving parts. Let's start with the pending lawsuit House Republicans brought against the Obama administration over cost-sharing subsidies, payments to insurance companies from the federal government that reduce the deductibles and co-pays for more than half of enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges. Congress sued, saying that the payments had not been specifically appropriated and were illegal, and a district court judge agreed. That decision, though, has been stayed and there's an appeal still pending from the Obama administrationTrump and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price haven't decided yet whether to drop the appeal and asked for a three-month extension of the stay a month ago. If the Trump administration decides to drop the appeal, they can cause a lot of disruption really fast. But there's a power lobby pushing them to allow the subsidies to continue: America's Health Insurance Plans, the primary industry group. \"Every American deserves access to affordable coverage and high-quality careand cost-sharing reductions help millions of Americans get the care and coverage they need,\" it said in a statement. \"They are a critical part of ensuring short-term stability of the market.\"", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/27/1647655/-Now-that-he-s-lost-Trumpcare-what-will-Trump-do-to-destroy-Obamacare-from-the-inside#read-more", "date": "2017/3/27"}, {"text": "Nunes role as the head of House Intelligence has always been in direct conflict with another of his positions.\n\nNunes, 43, has said he is committed to leading an impartial inquiry into Russias interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and search for any evidence of coordination with Trump or his associates. But Nunes, who served as an adviser on Trumps transition team, has also at times used his position as chair of the intelligence committee in ways that seem aligned with the interests of the White House.\n\nWays that seem aligned include Nunes repeatedly appearing on television and in print to knock down stories of TrumpRussia connections, even though some of those connections later turned out to be based on a lot more evidence than Nunes admitted. It also includes Nunes incredible performance when James Comey appeared before the committee, in which Nunes asked not a single question about the supposed topic of the hearing, but tried to get Comey to say that leakers were the real problem.\n\nNuness latest move came Friday, when he made a flurry of announcements that on the surface signaled promising new investigative paths, including an agreement to hear testimony from Trumps former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. But to Democrats, Nuness actions again seemed to show the hidden agenda of the White House.\n\nWhat makes it a hidden agenda? Well, to start with Nunes, acting alone, again made a series of deals with the White House, and Nunes again called a press conference before bothering to tell the other members of his committee what the conference was about, or that he had been discussing testimony with members of the Trump regime, in private. That hidden agenda.\n\nAnd theres one other little thing that Nunes slipped into his press conference without bothering to tell anyone beforehand:\n\nMost immediately, Nunes canceled an open hearing that had been scheduled for Tuesday with former senior officials who have battled Trump. Among them is former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates, who was fired by Trump; former director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., who publicly disputed Trumps wiretapping claim; and former CIA director John Brennan, who has said that Trump should be ashamed of himself over his behavior toward U.S. spy agencies.\n\nIt may seem like Devin Nunes is using the power of his position with the committee to stifle anyone who might say anything embarrassing about Trump, and using his inside connections at the White House to discuss in advance how Trump associates might testify to their advantage, and using his intelligence connections to warn his friends instead of search for the truth, and doing his best to sabotage any general narrative that begins to emerge in the press. It seems like that, because it is like that.\n\nAnd by the way: Who called Devin Nunes, what did they say, and where did he go before meeting with Ryan? Were seriously at the point where Nunes should move from being the leader of an investigation, to being the primary subject.\n\nIn fact, its very easy to believe that what caused Nunes to leap from that car is hearing his own name turn up on the FBI radar in relation to a meeting between Michael Flynn and his Turkish clients.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Congressman, Devin Nunes, a Republican heavyweight, also attended the breakfast.\n\nWas it an investigation of Flynn that cause Nunes to go screaming onto the sidewalks? In any case, it now appears that the go to Ryan, then go to Trump narrative may not be an accurate timeline for Nunes lost afternoon.\n\nIt has been something of a mystery, the whereabouts of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes on the day before his announcement that he saw information suggesting that communications of then-President-elect Donald Trump and his advisers may have been swept up in surveillance of other foreign nationals. One source told CNN that Nunes, a California Republican, was seen on the White House grounds the day before his announcement. In a phone interview, Nunes confirmed to CNN that he was on the White House grounds that day -- but he said he was not in the White House itself. (Other buildings, including the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, are on the same grounds.) No one has confirmed just where Nunes went or who he talked to, but it seems a fair bet he wasnt wandering the grounds as a test for the Secret Service.\n\nOne thing is certainDevin Nunes can no longer even pretend to lead any sort of reasonable investigation.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/27/1647631/-Devin-Nunes-has-made-himself-the-least-believable-man-in-Washington-and-that-takes-work#read-more", "date": "2017/3/27"}, {"text": "Thousands upon thousands of words canand havebeen written about what a total disaster of infighting and backstabbing the Trump White House has become, but this detail from Politicos Alex Isenstadt may tell you everything you need to know about how bad it is:\n\nAt the highest levels of the West Wing, the mood has grown so tense that staffers have begun calling up reporters inquiring whether other senior aides are leaking damaging information about them.\n\nIts like junior high school, only instead of whispering by the lockers about one anothers acne and who has a crush on whom theyre calling reporters and asking who said the epic Trumpcare failure was their fault or that Donald Trump was angry that they failed in his latest loyalty test.

Ann Wagner has been mentioned as a potential opponent for Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill for years, but she's said little about her plans publicly. Two months ago, Wagner signed on to run the NRCC's fundraising after initially stepping down from the post, and we wondered if that meant she'd decided to stay in the House. However, the Missouri Scout reports that on the contrary, conservative zillionaire Rex Sinquefield recently hosted a fundraiser for Wagner, and an attendee insisted she was \"all in\" for a Senate bid.\n\nWagner, who has a reputation as a formidable fundraiser, herself remains as quiet as ever. Other Republicans have made noises about running here, and one of them may draw some blood in a primary if they can portray the congresswoman, a former RNC co-chair who later was George W.

Neither state Attorney General Bill Schuette nor Lt. Gov. Brian Calley has jumped in yet, but they're both likely to run and take up most of the oxygen in the GOP primary.\n\n WI-Gov: Republican Gov. Scott Walker sounds likely to seek a third term next year, and Democrats will be elated if they can finally beat him. The field to face Walker is only slowly coming together, but there may be a development soon. Joe Parisi, the executive of Madison's Dane County, expressed interest in running last year, and he recently told the Cap Times that he'll have a \"definite decision\" within a month.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-34: Fundraising reports are in for the crowded April 4 special election for this safely blue Los Angeles seat covering the period from Jan. 1 to March 15, and there were some real surprises. All the candidates listed below are Democrats:\n\nLos Angeles Planning Commissioner Robert Lee Ahn: $330,000 raised, $303,000 self-funded, $271,000 cash-on-hand Nonprofit founder Maria Cabildo: $130,000 raised, $100,000 cash-on-hand Former Obama White House staffer Alejandra Campoverdi: $156,000 raised, $123,000 cash-on-hand Former Bernie Sanders staffer Arturo Carmona: $109,000 raised, $3,000 self-funded, $46,000 cash-on-hand Labor activist Wendy Carrillo: $81,000 raised, $58,000 cash-on-hand Former Los Angeles Board of Education member Yolie Flores: $128,000 raised, $55,000 cash-on-hand Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez: $245,000 raised, $275,000 cash-on-hand Former Los Angeles City Council aide Sara Hernandez: $230,000 raised, $141,000 cash-on-hand\n\nWe've heard almost nothing about Robert Lee Ahn, but he managed to outraise each of his opponents and gave himself another $303,000. Gomez, who has the backing of the Democratic establishment, brought in more than the rest of the field, though Hernandez wasn't far behind. All the candidates will compete on one ballot next month; in the very likely event that no one secures a majority, there will be a June runoff.\n\n VA-10: National Democrats are reportedly trying to convince state Sen. Jennifer Wexton to challenge GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock in this very anti-Trump Northern Virginia seat, but another Democrat reportedly is being encouraged to get in. The blog Blue Virginia reported a few weeks ago that Fairfax County Supervisor Kathy Smith has been approached by several labor groups. Smith has not said anything publicly about her plans, but she recently put out a statement telling Comstock to vote against Trump's proposed health care overall, declaring, \"If she chooses to represent Trump, we will hold her accountable for her actions.\" This seat swung from 51-49 Romney all the way to 52-42 Clinton, but Comstock won an expensive re-election contest 53-47.\n\nLegislative\n\n Pres-by-LD: Daily Kos Elections' project to calculate the 2016 presidential results for every state legislative seat in the nation hits North Carolina, one of the worst gerrymanders anywhere. You can find our master list of states here, which we'll be updating as we add new states; you can also find all our data from 2016 and past cycles here.\n\nDemocrats lost control of both chambers of the legislature in 2010, and the new GOP majorities quickly did all they could to make sure Team Blue never returned to power. Last year, a federal court ruled that the Republicans illegally packed African American voters into several seats in order to strengthen Republicans elsewhere, and they ordered the state to redraw several legislative districts and hold new elections in 2017. However, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay, and they have not yet announced if or when they'll take up the case.\n\nFor now, it's unclear if the GOP's map will remain intact, or if there will be a new one in place this fall or next year. North Carolina does not allow its governor to veto redistricting whatsoever, so if the GOP legislature has to come up with new districts, there isn't anything Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper can do to stop them from devising the strongest gerrymander they think the court will tolerate.\n\nThe GOP currently holds a 35-15 Senate majority and a 74-46 edge in the House. The GOP can override Cooper's vetoes with three-fifths of the vote in each chamber, so Democrats need to net six Senate seats or three House districts to take away Team Red's supermajority. The North Carolina GOP legislature is one of the most reactionary in the nation, and Democrats would be delighted if they can stop them from passing more bills like the notorious anti-LGBT HB2. However, that won't be easy. While Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in North Carolina by a close 50.5-46.8 margin, he won 31 of the 50 Senate seats and 76 of the 120 House seats. All the districts in both chambers are up every two years.\n\nIf Democrats can win all the Clinton seats in the Senate and take just two Trump districts, they'd be able to strip the GOP of their supermajority there. However, four Republicans represent Clinton turf, while no Democrats hold Trump seats. The bluest GOP-held seat is SD-15, a Raleigh seat that swung from 53-46 Romney all the way to 52-44 Clinton, but where GOP state Sen. John Alexander won a second term 50-46.\n\nIf Democrats took those four Clinton seats, the two most likely Trump targets are SD-27 and SD-19. SD-27, which is located in the Greensboro area, swung from 54-45 Romney to a smaller 50-47 Trump, but Republican incumbent Trudy Wade won a third term 53-47. SD-19, which includes much of Cumberland County, went in the other direction, going from 49.8-49.4 Obama to 51-46 Trump. (Because Cumberland splits so many large precincts in a way that scoops African Americans into a neighboring seat, it's possible we're actually underestimating Trump's performance here.) Republican state Sen. Wesley Meredith, the Senate majority whip, won re-election 56-44. Two other GOP Senate seats, SD-18 and SD-9, also gave Trump a margin of victory of about 5 percent, and they could be targets; however, both Republican senators Chad Barefoot and Michael Lee won re-election last year by double digits.\n\nDemocrats may have a better shot in the state House, where they need to net three seats to deny the GOP a supermajority, at least on paper. Five Democrats represent Trump seats in this chamber, so Team Blue may need to play some defense here. The reddest Democratic-held seat is HD-22, which went from 56-44 Romney to 59-40 Trump; Democratic state Rep. William Brisson won the general without any opposition, though he only prevailed in the primary 53-47. Brisson is a conservative Democrat who often votes with Republicans on key bills, meaning Democrats might need to net more than three seats to break the supermajority in practice.\n\nThree Republicans hold Clinton seats; the bluest is HD-104, a Charlotte-area district that dramatically swung from 56-43 Romney to 52-44 Clinton, but where Republican Andy Dulin won his first term 55-45. The other two Clinton/Republican seats are HD-36, which went from 54-45 Romney to 50-46 Clinton, and HD-105, which went from 57-42 Romney to 50-47 Clinton. HD-36's Nelson Dollar only won re-election 49-46, but HD-105's Scott Stone won his first full term 55-45.\n\nIt will be difficult enough for Democrats to take away the GOP supermajorities in either chamber under this map, and actually retaking either chamber is an even more daunting prospect. One way to illustrate how strong the GOP gerrymanders are is to sort each seat in each chamber by Trump's margin of victory over Clinton and see how the seat in the middleknown as the median seatvoted. Because North Carolina has an even number of seats, we average the Clinton and Trump percentages for the middle two seats to come up with the median. In the Senate, Trump won the median seat 58-40, while he carried the median House seat 54-42. For Democrats to retake either chamber, they'll need to win over several seats that Trump carried by double digits, a very intimidating prospect. With luck, this map won't be in effect much longer, but if the GOP has to draw up new boundaries, they'll do everything they can to maintain their huge advantages.\n\nP.S: We have one small bit of housekeeping for our results by congressional district for North Carolina, where we have some updated numbers. The changes are all very small: NC-05 goes from 57.3-39.8 Trump to 57.4-39.8; NC-10 goes from 61.0-36.5 Trump to 61.0-36.4; and NC-11 goes from 63.3-33.9 Trump to 63.2-34.0.\n\n Special Elections: The write-in votes have been tabulated in Tuesday's strange special election for Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic HD-197, and Democrat Emilio Vazquez has won. The Democrats' original nominee was thrown off the ballot for not residing in the district, and it was too late to substitute Vazquez, leaving Republican Lucinda Little as the only candidate on the ballot in a Philadelphia seat that Obama carried with 97 percent of the vote. Democrats waged a write-in campaign for Vazquez and on Tuesday, write-in votes made up 93 percent of the vote, while Little took just 7 percent. On Friday, election authorities announced that almost all of the write-ins were for Vazquez.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/27/1646971/-Morning-Digest-As-a-new-poll-gives-Jon-Ossoff-a-runoff-lead-the-GOP-spends-another-1-1-million#read-more", "date": "2017/3/27"}, {"text": "Were back for a live Monday show, and weekend catch-up time with Greg Dworkin.\n\nThis is Week 10 of The Presidential Apprentice, and things arent getting any easier for Donald Trump.

In a word: insincerity. Republicans had seven years to do their own hard work, to coalesce around a credible conservative alternative to the ACA. They might have used this time to work with Republican governors, to explore which conservative policy ideas seem to stick, which aspects of ACA needed to be retained. They might have crafted a more moderate bill along the lines of the Cassidy-Collins bill, which would have given liberal states and Republican governors who adopted Medicaid expansion much greater leeway. Or they might have refined another conservative model, such as Avik Roys modifications to ACA exchanges, to turn ACAs exchanges in a more conservative direction. They might have prepared the American public for whatever plan they chose.

The Answer Is the Party, Not the President Those not inclined to solely blame Trump for the demise of repeal-and-replaceincluding the White House itselfhave mostly aimed their shots at Ryan instead. Liberals who have rolled their eyes for years at Ryan's boy-genius reputation in Washington claim righteous vindication from this week's events, while some conservatives sympathetic to Trump have sought to shift responsibility to the speaker for drafting an unpopular and politically risky bill that could not make it through his own House.\n\nWhile it's certainly true that both the president and the speaker made mistakes in handling the health care issue, it's inaccurate to portray the demise of the AHCA as primarily a consequence of individual failures of leadership or strategy. Replace Trump and Ryan with Marco Rubio and John Boehner, or Jeb Bush and Kevin McCarthy, and the results would almost certainly be more or less the same. The bill died so quickly, and was so far away from success when it did fail (remember, the House was by all accounts the easier lift of the two chambers), that the specific day-to-day behavior of the principal actors seems inadequate to account for the result.\n\nThe real obstacle to the passage of health care reform is the Republican Party itself, and any full reckoning with what just happened has to grapple with that fact.\n\nx But @haroldpollack is a Democrat.

I didnt stand up when he said that, Labrador said. Thats the only part of the speech where I thought, Thats not even close to what my party stands for. To House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking Americas debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, On the spending front, things could slip away really quickly. Trumps budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already pint-size) conservative piatas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department  cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, even the cabinet secretaries at the E.P.A. and Interior are saying these cuts arent going to happen. Theyre going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E.P.A. out of the 5 percent that isnt protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N.E.A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West  states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N.E.A. grants  thats a re-election killer.

Grothman has said over the years, but that would end up being a novel. But its worth noting a couple of things he has proposed as a U.S. Congress member.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rep. Grothman is against Obamacare. He really hates ithates it so much he has attached an amendment to the Republican health care bill. The amendment would end the provision allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance policies until they hit age 26. Grothmans amendment would change that age to 23. After sending a request to his office (I also tweeted the question, and sent a Facebook message) asking him the reasoning behind this amendment, I have not received a response. This amendment is baffling. There is no sane reasoning behind it. Who does it hurt to have a child on a parents insurance until the age of 26?\n\nOf course with Rep. Grothman, the answer is often in plain sight. First, Grothman stated that he identified an issue with Pell Grants that doesn't get much attention.\" Anecdotal evidence in his district indicated people are choosing not to marry so they can have incomes low enough to qualify for the need-based aid program. But waittheres more!he also argued:\n\n...that first-year students should be barred from receiving Pell Grants to make sure the federal government is not \"wasting money\" on those who don't graduate. And he suggested that low-income recipients are spending the grant aid on \"goodies and electronics.\" Those students could pay for college by taking out loans, he said.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to guess that his attack on Pell grants is somehow tied to his amendment on the age kids are kicked off their parents health insurance.

President Obamas approach bears the strong influence of Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and Brooks knows it. In fact, he wrote two different opinion pieces about the influence of Niebuhr on Obama (here, and here). For what its worth, Douthat wrote one too. On the other people cited, Ive written extensively about the influence of Rev. King on Obama.\n\nMore broadly, Obama has repeatedly offered precisely the unifying story Douthat and Brooks assert our country needs, one that includes both the traditional heroes from the older narrative Douthat says appeals to many, as well as figures representing a much broader cast of characters, i.e., those excluded from the older narrative, and who are pretty heroic as well. The 44th president wove all their stories into a single history of a diverse, yet unified people working to realize the ideals laid out at the founding. Obamas story of America is, in fact, just what Brooks called for: a progressively realized grand narrative.\n\nTo the chagrin of some, Obamas Americarightly, in my viewrejects both the whitewashed narrative that was predominant in the 1950s and the overwhelmingly negative vision Brooks criticized, one steeped in American tales of genocide, slavery, oppression and segregation. To be sure, no one could be elected president running around talking about America in such a negative way. Furthermore, anyone demanding that a progressive candidate must do so in order to earn their vote is only helping elect candidates who espouse the opposite understanding of America. Obamas narrative describes our progress as uneven, yes, but nonetheless moving toward the goal we as a people set for ourselves.\n\nOf dozens of examples in which Obama lays out his conception of American history and national identity, here are a few that span his time on the national stage. From his 2006 book The Audacity of Hope, heres one that offers a unifying narrative paralleling what Brooks says we need:\n\n[The] Constitution...despite being marred by the original sin of slaveryhas at its very core the idea of equal citizenship under the law. . . . Of course racism and nativist sentiments have repeatedly undermined these ideals . . . but in the hands of reformers, from Tubman to Douglass to Chavez to King, these ideals of equality have gradually shaped how we understand ourselves and allowed us to form a multicultural nation the likes of which exists nowhere else on earth.\n\nOn the night he won the 2008 Iowa caucuses:\n\nHope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire. What led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation. What led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery for freedom's cause.\n\nFrom the first day of his second term:\n\nWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths - that all of us are created equal - is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.\n\nIn his eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney, one of the nine African Americans murdered by a white supremacist in a Charleston, South Carolina, church:\n\nRemoving the Confederate flag from this states capitol...would be one step in an honest accounting of Americas history; a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds. It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this state and this country for the better, because of the work of so many people of goodwill, people of all races striving to form a more perfect union.\n\nAnd from his farewell address:\n\nFor 240 years, our nations call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation. Its what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom. Its what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande, pushed women to reach for the ballot, powered workers to organize. Its why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan  and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.\n\nMaybe the blindness of writers like Douthat and Brooks isnt blindness at all, but instead strategy. Maybe they feel like theyll lose their ability to reach anti-Trump Republicans if they acknowledge that Obama has already done what they are calling for someone to do. Part of me can understand that thinking. But another part of me says that the strategic value of a Republican saying: if its a choice between Trumpism and Obamaism, Ill take Obamaism would be far better. Plus, just tell the damn truth if you know what Obama has been doing.\n\nGiving Obama credit for putting forth a balanced, inclusive conception of national identity wouldnt mean endorsing the whole of the Democratic policy platform. Even on the national narrative itself, if Douthat and/or Brooks want to say that Obama hasnt been effective enough in selling the vision he (and they) have described, thats a point we can debate as well. But if they honestly believe that he hasnt been putting that vision out there time and again for years, well, then they just havent been listening.\n\nIan Reifowitz is the author of Obamas America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity (Potomac Books).", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/26/1646051/-The-blindness-of-anti-Trump-Republicans#read-more", "date": "2017/3/26"}, {"text": "Donald Jr, Eric.\n\nIn an interview with Forbes, Donald Trump's dumbest son Qusay gives away the game: Even the ruse of Trump handing ownership of his companies to his own sons while in elected office, ownership that he will then reclaim after he leaves that office, was itself a con.

His answerblue states more than redwas obvious:\n\nThose in the red states still smarting over Barack Obama's election victory can perhaps take solace in this: The Democrats' No. 1 domestic policy initiative, universal health care, is likely to help red America at the expense of blue. Health-care reform may be overdue in a country with 45 million uninsured and soaring medical costs, but it will also represent a substantial wealth transfer from the North and the East to the South and the West. The Northeast and the Midwest have much higher rates of coverage than the rest of the country, led by Massachusetts, where all but 3 percent of residents are insured. The disproportionate share of uninsured is in the South and the West, the result of employment patterns, weak unions and stingy state governments. Texas leads the way, with a quarter of its population uninsured; it would be at the top even without its many illegal immigrants.\n\nA quick glance at what Gallup called the uninsured belt showed a striking resemblance to the 2008 electoral map. By 2011, three years before Obamacares individual insurance mandate was to finally kick in, Texas far and away led the nation with an uninsured rate of a staggering 28 percent. Led by Mitt Romney's Massachusetts, 9 of the top 10 performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nBefore Obamacare, health insurance more or less followed the electoral map.\n\nBut merely tallying up the ranks of the uninsured understated the magnitude of the health care horror story then unfolding in Red State America. When the Commonwealth Fund released its 2009 state health care scorecard, which measured each states performance in providing health care access, prevention and treatment, avoidable hospital use, equity across income levels, and healthy lives for residents. Again, while nine of the top 10 performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008, four of the bottom five (including Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) and 14 of the last 20 backed John McCain. That at least was an improvement from the 2007 analysis, in which all 10 cellar dwellers had voted for George W. Bush three years earlier. (When then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry co-authored an op-ed with Newt Gingrich in November 2009 titled Let States Lead the Way, the Lone Star State was ranked 46th in the country.)\n\nMost of the top-performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\nThe cellar dwellers generally backed John McCain and Mitt Romney.\n\nSadly, red states didnt just generally lack the resources of their blue state cousins. Residents of GOP-controlled states also were sickeroften much sicker. In November 2009, a United Health Foundation analysis (funded by UnitedHealth Group) examined 22 indicators of health, including everything from how many children receive recommended vaccinations, to obesity and smoking rates, to cancer deaths. Echoing the results of that years Americas Health Rankings, the results were quite familiar. As Forbes explained:\n\nVermont ranked first this year thanks in part to its low rate of obesity, high number of doctors and a low rate of child poverty. New England in general sets a benchmark for the country, the report found. All six New England states are in the top 10. These states have favorable demographics and an excellent public health infrastructure, including a large number of doctors per capita. Eight of the 10 bottom-ranked states are from the south, with Mississippi coming in dead last for the ninth consecutive year. Mississippi has a sky-high death rate from heart disease and high infant mortality. In general, residents of these states are more likely to be smokers or to be obese, the report found. They also have worse health insurance coverage, fewer physicians per capita and live in areas with high violent crime and more child poverty.\n\nAfter the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the picture changed dramatically. The percentage of Americans lacking health insurance plunged from 16.0 percent when Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010 to just 8.6 percent by January 2017. And as I pointed out last fall, that was only the beginning of the ACAs positive impact:\n\nBy most measures, the Affordable Care Act which made health insurance possible for some 25 million Americans has been an overwhelming success. Over 10 million people have purchased private insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces, with about three-quarters receiving subsidies to help cover the cost. States which chose to expand Medicaid have, as predicted, extended coverage to millions more of their residents, slashed their costs for uncompensated care for the uninsured and improved the financial stability of their hospitals. At less than 9 percent, America's uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record. And the ACA hasn't just remained under budget even as the rate of health care cost growth has slowed. Obamacare, it turns out, has helped reduce income inequality.\n\nBut that very real progress nationally shouldnt obscure the dramatic improvements in some of the lowest-performing states. As the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index reported in February, six states reduced their uninsured rate by at least 10 percentage points between 2014 and 2016. As they have since the opening of the Obamacare exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid, Arkansas and Kentucky (each of which began with more than 20 percent uninsured), made the greatest progress of all:\n\nAfter Obamacare, the percentage of uninsured drop by 12 points in Arkansas and Kentucky,\n\nAgain, the improvements under the Affordable Care Act werent limited to insurance for those age 19 to 64. In its 2015 roundup, the Commonwealth Fund highlighted the major advances in states including Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Kentucky:\n\nWhile Democratic states continued to lead the rankings, red states made large gains after the ACA.\n\nIts 2017 scorecard (using 2015 data) showed that 14 of the top 15 best performing state health care systems voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Only one of the bottom 15 (Nevada) failed to vote for Republican Donald Trump. But in comparing their performance compared to two years earlier, Kentucky and Oklahoma were the most improved across the Commonwealth Funds 25 individual indicators. Ten of the 15 most improved states voted for Donald Trump for president in 2016.\n\nSome of the biggest improvements came in the old uninsured belt in the old South.\n\nNow, it should be noted that states in which Republicans controlled the governors office and the legislature could have done better still. But as widely predicted in 2013 and 2014, Republican obstructionism prevented that from happening. After all, the lawsuit that unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the Obamacare individual mandate also made the laws Medicaid expansion optional for the states. All 10 states that achieved the greatest reductions in their uninsured rates opted for Medicaid expansion. And as the Commonwealth Fund lamented, the states that refused to do so experienced much smaller declines in the percentage of uninsured adults.\n\nThe states that refused to expand Medicaid made a huge mistake.\n\nThe GOPs big no to Medicaid expansion in 22 states may well be the greatest act of political spite in modern American history. After all, millions of red states residents werent just left without insurance because they needlessly fell into the coverage gap, where they earned too much for Medicaid and not enough to qualify for subsidies to buy private insurance. As multiple studies predicted, the opt-out states saw their hospitals struggle and sometimes close, especially in rural areas, while the expansion states enjoyed greater stability as the need for uncompensated care for the uninsured plummeted. Republican states like Missouri, Georgia, and Texas also shot themselves in the foot by banning or limiting the work of so-called Obamacare navigators. They hindered that network of non-profits, churches, community groups, universities, and hospitals who help enroll Americans in insurance under the ACA, despite the fact that many of the very same groups perform the same function for Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. The same goes for the Republican sabotage of reinsurance risk corridors also used by Medicare programs, the gutting of which helped leave dozens of Obamacare co-ops (including mine in Oregon) insolvent when Uncle Sam paid only 12 cents on the dollar owed to them.\n\nNevertheless, progress for Republican states and Republican voters thanks to the Affordable Care Act has been very real and very significant. But what President Obama and Democrats in Congress giveth, President Trump and Republican leaders in the House and Senate now want to taketh away.\n\nEven as these words were being written, House Speaker Paul Ryan was working late into the night to come up with a version of his American Health Care Act cruel enough to win over the support of the GOPs hard-line Freedom Caucus. But while the details of erasing Obamacares essential health benefits (EHBs), a Medicaid per capita cap or block grant for the states and perhaps richer tax credits for older enrollees are all still moving targets, there is little doubt that Ryans will be a plan of draconian health care rationing. And bearing a surprising brunt of that pain will be those who pulled the lever for Donald Trump on Election Day.\n\nHeres why.\n\nRyans rationing starts as it always does with subsidies that are too small. Trumpcares age-based tax credits start at $2,000 a year for those 18 to 29, and max out at $4,000 for Americans starting at age 60. As the CBO showed, a 64-year old person making $26,500 annually would see their share of his/her insurance premium jump from $1,700 to $14,500 a year. And as the Kaiser Family Foundation showed, the impact of the GOPs American Health Care Act would be staggering for lower-income and older policyholders compared to the current subsidies provided by Obamacare.\n\nUnder the GOP plan endorsed by Ryan and Trump, older and lower income Americans get hit hard.\n\nUnder the AHCA, the percentage of uninsured will rise for every age group and income level.\n\nBut this picture understates the pain inflicted on current Obamacare beneficiaries. Deductibles and out-of-pocket costs would inevitably rise as well, in part because the GOP plan allows insurers to sell plans which pay out a smaller percentage of costs for physician visits, tests, prescription drugs, surgical procedures, and hospitals. More damaging still, the Ryan/Trump plan eliminates cost-sharing reductions provided the Affordable Care Act that currently enable lower income individuals and families to get discounts on deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. Worst of all, as Kaiser warned, the AHCAs limits on the growth of its tax credits over time means that gap with the ACAs subsidies will grow with each passing year:\n\nWhile ACA tax credits grow as premiums increase over time, the tax credits in the American Health Care Act are indexed to inflation plus 1 percentage point. Based on CBOs projections of ACA tax credit increases and inflation, the disparity between the average credits under the ACA and the two replacement plans would widen over time. The average tax credit current marketplace enrollees would receive under the American Health Care Act would be 41% lower than under the ACA in 2022 and 44% lower in 2027.\n\nThe GOPs insufficient tax credits become even more inadequate over time.\n\nAs many have noted, the GOPs plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will hit Trump voters hardest. Its no mystery as to why. As the New York Times explained, The Republican plan offers less assistance to older and lower income Americans, especially in rural areas. Due to the lack of competition for insurers and health care providers, as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) documented, 12 of the 15 states hardest hit by the AHCAs shriveled tax credits are rural ones. Fourteen of the 15 voted for Donald Trump for president in 2016.\n\nThe most rural and Trump-supporting states will experience the most pain under the GOP plan.\n\nTrump won almost all of these states. Voters there are among the biggest losers in his health plan.\n\nAnd as CBPP also explained, Ryancare wont protect people who benefitted from Medicaid expansion, either. The result of slashing Medicaid funding and turning over whats left in the form of block grants to the states is knowable: states simply will choose to trim benefits and reduce eligibility, especially during times of economic recession. But the Ryan plan is even worse. As workers incomes rise and fall, they may lose Medicaid and then become subject to the 30 percent continuous coverage penalty they must paynot to Uncle Sam, but to a private insurer. In the meantime, those gigantic Medicaid cuts will go to fund tax cuts for millionaires, who just happen to disproportionately live in Clinton country.\n\nWhile Trump voters will get hit harder in the pocketbook by the GOP health care plan...\n\n...wealthy Clinton supporters will get the lions share of the AHCAs tax cuts.\n\nWorse still, each states block grant will have a per capita cap that only grows each year by the consumer price index plus 1 percent. As with the AHCAs insufficient tax subsidies, that simply wont keep up with the usually higher rate of medical inflation. The inevitable outcome, the CBO predicted this week, is 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026.\n\nNow, all of these numbers could still change. After all, as of this writing, House Republicans were preparing to vote on an unfinished revision to the GOP Obamacare replacement bill, one the Congressional Budget Office hadnt yet seen, let alone scored. What, if anything, the Senate votes on remains mysterious, too. But what isnt a mystery is what will happen if President Trump ultimately affixes his signature to any Republican health care bill. His voters will suffer. And in those reddest of red states, those very places where Republicans poll best, health care will get a lot worse.\n\nAgain.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/26/1646332/-Trumpcare-in-red-and-blue#read-more", "date": "2017/3/26"}, {"text": "See if you can figure out who the crack negotiator is in this picture.\n\nThe current sitting president is an idiot manchild.

[...] But the bill has been backdated even further to 2002, the year Mrs Merkels predecessor, Gerhard Schrder, pledged to spend more on defence. Mr Trump reportedly instructed aides to calculate how much German spending fell below two per cent over the past 12 years, then added interest.\n\nThat this stunt did not create an immediate international incident is evidence of Merkel's own professionalism and/or evidence that even our international allies do not take Idiot Manchild seriously.

Josh Barro, a former Republican who left his party because of its leaders intellectual dishonesty, wrote an article for Business Insider titled \"Republicans lied about healthcare for years, and they're about to get the punishment they deserve\" that is a must-read. He wrote:\n\nFor years, Republicans promised lower premiums, lower deductibles, lower co-payments, lower taxes, lower government expenditure, more choice, the restoration of the $700 billion that President Barack Obama heartlessly cut out of Medicare because he hated old people, and (in the particular case of the Republican who recently became president) \"insurance for everybody\" that is \"much less expensive and much better\" than what they have today. They were lying. Over and over and over and over, Republicans lied to the American public about healthcare. It was impossible to do all of the things they were promising together, and they knew it. Then they unexpectedly won an election and had to face the question of whether they would break all of their promises  or only some of them. If the AHCA passes, Republicans will have delivered on a couple of promises: lower taxes (mostly for people who make over $200,000 a year) and lower public expenditure (mostly because of Medicaid cuts, the main reason the bill could leave 24 million more Americans uninsured). All the rest of the promises will be broken. And if they don't pass the AHCA, well, then they'll have broken all of the promises. Either way, Republicans will have to face an angry electorate in 2018 and 2020 that did not get what it was promised. The exposure of Republican healthcare lies will do grave damage to the party, and that damage will be richly deserved.\n\nMost people who understand both policy and economics realized that Republicans were lying from the beginning. In the short term, a truthful narrative is generally much less appealing than a misleading or dishonest one. Republicans are finding out that governing requires a certain degree of intellectual honesty, lest they succumb to those pesky things known as math and reality.\n\nSo its high time that alleged pro-lifers become what most of us are: real pro-lifers, the kind who want folks to live. Its time to disregard the lies that many in the willfully ignorant brigade allowed themselves to believe.\n\nObamacare reduced death rates. But states like Texas continue the implicit murder of their citizens by not extending the Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act. We can mitigate this all by working together as one huge group of Americans and telling our political leaders we want Medicare for All, a single payer systemand it is even more pro-life than Obamacare. From the same studies:\n\nThe editorials authors estimate the impact of replacing the ACA with a universal, single-payer health system, along the lines of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, H.R. 676, would provide immediate coverage to the 26 million Americans who are currently uninsured, saving at least 20,984 lives in year one.\n\nSo if we remove ideology from the equation and choose to stop being willfully ignorant and gullible, we all can be true pro-lifers and make sure every one of our citizens is taken care of.\n\nAnd do not believe the lie that we cannot afford it: we are the wealthiest country in the world.

As shown on the map below, states with 55 percent of congressional districts were drawn to favor Republicans in the 2010s round of redistricting, but just 10 percent for Democrats.\n\nClick here for an interactive version of this map that explains each state\n\nThis situation is just as bad at the state level, as the second map below illustrates. The redistricting process in 48 state legislative chambers was designed to favor Republicans, including both chambers in 23 states amounting to 50 percent of the population. Mapmakers intended to favor Democrats in just 23 chambers and only both of them in 10 states with a mere 15 percent of the population. That means Republicans had the opportunity to draw three times as many districts as Democrats did.\n\nThe GOPs lopsided advantage in congressional redistricting led to a situation where Donald Trump and Mitt Romney each won a decisive majority of House seats even though both Republican presidential candidates lost the national popular vote. This discrepancy is important in an era where ticket-splitting remains at historic lows, limiting Democrats ability to win a House majority despite a popular vote edge. Gerrymandering likely cost Democrats control of the House in 2012, and it made 2016 a foregone conclusion despite the close presidential race.\n\nRampant and one-sided partisan gerrymandering has consequently shut Democrats out of power at the state level too. In 2012, Democratic candidates effectively won the overall popular vote while Republicans obtained more seats in the U.S. House and state legislative chambers across Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These gerrymanders persistently allow Republican votes to count more than Democratic ones do.\n\nVoter Suppression Laws\n\nNot only have Republicans aggressively gerrymandered most of the country, but they have also passed scores of laws that make it harder to cast a ballot itself. These most notoriously include voter ID, but also such measures as cutting early voting availability, repealing same-day registration, closing polling places in Democratic-heavy areas, ending the straight-ticket voting option, and purging Democratic-leaning demographics from the registration rolls. Republicans even took legal action to maintain lifetime felony disenfranchisement, which was originally an explicit tool of white supremacists.\n\nRather than preventing nearly non-existent impersonation fraud, voter ID is designed to disenfranchise predominantly poor, black, or Latino voters who might have trouble obtaining the necessary documentation. Cuts to voting hours, locations, and the straight-ticket option are all intended to make voting more burdensome by dramatically increasing the time and distance it takes to cast a ballot. These hurdles particularly hit hard for those who lack transportation options or cannot afford to take off work to stand in line for five hours on Election Day. They effectively constitute a poll tax.\n\nFelony disenfranchisement has a dramatic racial disparity that has taken on a partisan lens thanks to racially polarized voting. In states like Virginia, where Republican legislators unsuccessfully fought Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffes 2016 actions to restore voting rights for those who had completed their sentences, an astonishing 80 percent of the disenfranchised had fully served their time, while African Americans were five times more likely to be barred from voting than whites.\n\nWhat makes these voter suppression efforts even more pernicious is how systematic they are. Republicans have relied on draft legislation from conservative interest groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council to introduce near-identical bills in state after state not long after they assumed unified control over state government. As shown on the map below from the Brennan Center for Justice, 20 states imposed mostly GOP-backed voting restrictions ahead of the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Other states attempted to do so, but only failed because of court rulings against them, or have passed new restrictions since 2016.\n\nAmong those 20 states, Republicans had gained unified power in Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin only after Barack Obama became president. They furthermore used newfound conservative control over the governors office in Florida and Iowa to significantly impede the ability of those with felony convictions to regain their voting rights upon completion of their sentence.\n\nRepublicans immediately introduced new restrictions in Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and New Hampshire as soon as they gained control. Iowas state House has already passed a voter ID bill, and Missouri Republicans recently implemented their own voter ID law. New Hampshire Republicans proposed tightening voter residency requirements, which could disenfranchise students, eliminating same-day registration, and gerrymandering the Electoral College. Kentuckys GOP governor overturned his Democratic predecessors executive action to restore voting rights for those with past felony convictions when he took office in 2015.\n\nWhile federal courts struck down several of these state-level restrictions in 2016, Trumps election and his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court could see the high court enable a new wave of voting restrictions without the fear of federal interference. This very thing happened after the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\n\nAttacks on Unions\n\nWhile gerrymandering and voter suppression have long dominated the spotlight in the voting wars, union-busting plays an indispensable role too. Unions have long been part of the backbone of the Democratic Party, especially in politically competitive Rust Belt states with a history of manufacturing and industry. Unions often spent heavily on politics, doing their part to modestly counteract big business spending on behalf of Republicans.\n\nCrucially, unions dont just organize workers to fight for better pay and conditions, they also mobilized them for political participation by conducting get-out-the-vote operations and endorsing candidates. In an era of declining trust in a broad variety of public institutions, unions are an increasingly uncommon organization that can activate their members political awareness about issues and mobilize that energy into political action.\n\nSo-called right to work laws prevent unions from automatically deducting fees from the workers whom they bargain for but who arent dues-paying members. This prohibition creates a strong incentive for workers to free-ride since they can enjoy the benefits of the union bargaining on their behalf without having to pay the agency fees for that bargaining (which are still less than full membership dues). Consequently, these laws can lead to a sharp drop in union membership and financial capacity, while they of course doesnt actually guarantee that people have the right to work by ensuring that they can obtain a job.\n\nWhile Republicans undoubtedly want to crush unions because they believe businesses should take a bigger slice of the economic pie, their doing so comes with the bonus of hurting Democrats electorally. McElwee cites political science research that finds that states adopting right to work laws could reduce the vote share going to Democratic candidates by 2 to 4 percent in presidential elections and 3 to 5 points in Senate races. While this research is far from definitive, even a modest impact could have been devastating in 2016 when Republicans only narrowly won the Electoral College and Senate.\n\nAs shown below, Republicans have passed right to work laws this decade in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, while they only narrowly failed to do so in New Hampshire in 2017.\n\nThey have additionally passed laws that limit or end collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio. Voters successfully vetoed that attempt in Ohio in 2011, but many of these states lack ballot referendums or have seen Republicans prevail in them anyway. Without fail, every single one of these states where Republicans attacked unions had seen their party gain unified control of state government only in 2010 or subsequent elections.\n\nNow that Republicans wield complete control over the federal government and will soon regain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, the GOP could advance these voter suppression and anti-union laws nationwide, just like they have done in the states. There is already a significant likelihood that the Supreme Court will effectively impose right to work for public-sector unions once Gorsuch replaces the late Antonin Scalia. Additionally, some Republican Congress members have proposed passing a federal right to work law for all unions.\n\nRepublican-appointed justices are also extremely hostile to voting rights, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also a longtime voting rights opponent. His Justice Department is likely to persecute Democratic-leaning demographics over nonexistent voting fraud and defend voting restrictions in court. Trump himself falsely claims that there are millions of fraudulent voters, which could give congressional Republicans a pretext to pass changes to federal voting laws that could further impose burdensome voter ID or proof-of-citizenship requirements, which could disenfranchise many eligible voters.\n\nIt has become undeniable that Republicans simply refuse to accept the legitimacy of their political opposition. Democrats must act accordingly to actively push back against voter suppression laws and anti-union measures. While Democrats control few state governments, they must pass laws to protect and expand voting rights where they can, or rely on ballot initiatives to circumvent hostile Republicans.

Anderson continued, Another example, Pennsylvania Act 62 requires private insurers to pay the first $36,000 in autism support claims every policy year, while another state might not have an autism mandate at all. They would both be able to sell plans side-by-side.\n\nThe health cost to insure Jane or John Doe can be lower in some markets simply because doctors charge less in those parts, or because accidents happen less, or because John and Jane are on average healthier than people in other states. But another way costs can be reduced is with higher copays, or by lowballing providers, or by reducing or eliminating coverage altogether anyway they can, some of which the ACA did away with (preexisting conditions, lifetimes caps, etc.). Purely as an illustration, what if in some states insurance companies have to cover prenatal care while in others they dont? Or maybe in one place Rx copays are limited to $50 by the local state insurance board, whereas in the state next door theyre a cool $100.\n\nAnderson went on to point how complicated and potentially destabilizing it could get. He explained that a state using whats called a pure community rating -- meaning everyone pays the same price -- could face major disruption, what some might even call a death spiral, if a company from outside the state could sell into that market and not be subject to that state requirement. He said in that scenario, an outside company could sell cheaper coverage to 22 year olds, avoid older consumers, and thus undermine the existing private health insurance market for everyone in the state.\n\nHealthcare is complicated, the details are wonky, but the consequences potentially affect all of us. An argument can be made that insurance companies thrive fine in stable markets. That standardizing benefit packages allows them to plan long term, and that theyd just as soon avoid engaging in a vicious zero sum game. The insurance industry is, by and large, small c conservative in nature.\n\nBut companies are more than capable of competing in a dog eat dog market if need be. And while selling across state lines might have some benefits as a result of that competition, they look to be few and far between for most consumers. Per usual it will probably be the youngest, healthiest ones who would reap the benefit. For the rest of us it will probably result in more money out of pocket and all kinds of hidden restrictions, and since the young and healthy today are guaranteed to get older tomorrow, that means sooner or later, everyone will feel those many hidden pinches. Which could work out great for some insurance companies.

The survey was funded by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago.\n\nJust a quarter of young Americans have a favorable view of the Republican Party, and 6 in 10 have an unfavorable view. Majorities of young people across racial and ethnic lines hold negative views of the GOP. The Democratic Party performs better, but views aren't overwhelmingly positive. Young people are more likely to have a favorable than an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party by a 47 percent to 36 percent margin. But just 14 percent say they have a strongly favorable view of the Democrats. Views of the Democratic Party are most favorable among young people of color. Roughly 6 in 10 blacks, Asians and Latinos hold positive views of the party. Young whites are somewhat more likely to have unfavorable than favorable views, 47 percent to 39 percent. As for Trump, 8 in 10 young people think he is doing poorly in terms of the policies he's put forward and 7 in 10 have negative views of his presidential demeanor.\n\nThe age separations in the Pew Research numbers show that its not just millennials and silents who are divided politically. The figures from Pew show that millennials and those from Generation X (ages 36-51) see themselves as liberal or moderately liberal and leaning toward Democrats. Baby boomers and silents skewed Republican and conservative.\n\nIn 2016, as in recent years, Millennials and Gen Xers were the most Democratic generations. And both groups had relatively large  and growing  shares of liberal Democrats: 27% of Millennials and 21% of Gen Xers identified as liberal Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. By contrast, Boomers and Silents were the most Republican groups  largely because of the higher shares of conservative Republicans in these generations. Nearly a third of Boomers (31%) and 36% of Silents described themselves as conservative Republicans or Republican leaners, which also is higher than in the past.\n\nAnother interesting point from Pew: The percentage of independents, at least in the Pew Research numbers, has shrunk. The percentage of those with no party identification has gone from 17 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2016. Usually that total changes little from year to year. But as the numbers of partisans, both liberal Democrats (especially!) and conservative Republicans have grown, the number of no-label voters has grown smaller.\n\nIts no secret that Democratic candidates have received more overall votes than Republicans in recent elections, even if that doesnt mean that Democrats win more races. In the presidential race, Hillary Clinton received 65,844,610 votes to Trumps 62,979,636, a percentage difference of 48.2 percent to 46.1 percent. In Senate races (slightly skewed, because two Democrats were running against each other in vote-heavy California), Democrats earned 10,512,669 more votes than Republican candidates. Yet the Republicans retained their majority. In the House, Republicans received 49 percent of the vote, contrasted with Democrats 48 percent, yet they hold 55 percent of the seats.\n\nTo recover completely, the Democratic Party must grow at state levels, and theres growing interest there. A recent meeting coordinated by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee included some 20 groups from across the country, from labor unions to outside funding groups. According to a story from NBC News:\n\nDemocratic officials have had to add extra candidate training sessions to keep up with demand and increase enrollment in existing ones. One major training group, Emerge America, reports an 87% surge in candidate applications over last year. The women's group Emily's List says nearly 10,000 women have expressed interest in running for office since November, including for state legislative seats. Meanwhile, Run for Something, which is focused on recruiting millennials, says it has heard the same from almost 8,000 young people.  \"Everything has changed,\" Jessica Post, the DLCC executive director, said in an interview in her office.\n\nWhat about the Republicans at the state levels?\n\nEllie Hockenbury, the spokesperson for the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, said the GOP has already found strong candidates for this year's races, though they're just getting started on next year's midterms.\n\nThere is plenty of anecdotal evidence of high Democratic interest in running for local races, too. This Daily Kos diary describes a surge in interest by women candidates who attended a Ready to Run program at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Those same kinds of programs also are starting in other states. Even if some of those candidates ultimately decide not to run, the numbers are improving.\n\nThe group Run for Something was launched to capture the enthusiasm of young protesters after Trumps election and the millions of people who came out for the Womens March. It wants to get potential candidates to take the next electoral step. Its focusing on helping millennials run for office, aiming in 2017 for Virginia and North Carolina. According to a story in Mother Jones:\n\nThe idea isn't just to supply candidates where none are currently running; the group believes the bench is too thin everywhere because Democrats are too exclusive in how they pick out candidates. \"Parties are usually focused on asking their electeds, their staff, their networks, who they think should run,\" [Run for Something Co-founder Amanda] Litman says. That helps build a pipeline, but it's also an echo chamber that makes it difficult for new faces and voices to penetrate. It can be intimidating, she argues, for a prospective candidate to figure out how to run, without an organization to walk him or her through it. \"So we're trying to reach people who, one, might not ever be approached by a party or by a recruitment network, or two, might not be comfortable raising their hand if the party asks, 'Who wants to run?' \" In other words, women, people of color, and members of the LGBT communityall under the age of 35.\n\nAs the Mother Jones story points out, theres no time to lose:\n\nThe quest to rebuild the Democratic bench is a long-term fight with one ominous deadline in sight. The next round of redistricting is coming up in 2020, and Democrats are still paying the price for their catastrophic losses ahead of the last redistricting. If they can't get a foothold in state legislatures before thenthey currently control both houses of the legislature and the governor's mansion in just six statesthings stand to get even worse.\n\nThere are other groups, too. Brand New Congress was started by supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders specifically to elect just what the name implies: its aiming for 400-plus candidates. Higher Heights is hoping to find and help elect more black women candidates.\n\nIn my own town (admittedly a hotbed of progressive activismwe had an 87 percent turnout in the November election and went heavily for Hillary Clinton) there are contested races for the village board and two school boards. Even the library board has 10 candidates running for four spots.\n\nThe most important number, however, is the number of voters who show up on Election Day. Republicans historically have a midterm edge, since older voters tend to be more reliable for those elections. Recent voter turnouts in big-city municipal primaries dont offer much hope. In Los Angeles, turnout in the mayoral primary was first reported at 11 percent but grew to 17 percent once all of the mail-in ballots were counted. At least that's better than the 11 percent turnout of years past. In St. Louis, turnout in that citys mayoral primary was 28 percentagain, better than the 22 percent of four years ago, but nothing to brag about.\n\nYet midterm elections usually show a downturn for the incumbent presidents party. But in the age of Trump, all bets may be off.\n\nIts still a long time until November 2018.

They are threatening to do this if Democrats dont join them.\n\nIf this is how its going to be, then let them.\n\nDemocrats should use the opportunity to talk about how Republicans are undermining democracyand Republicans will own any future terrible Supreme Court decisions.\n\nSpending by corporations and wealthy donors significantly increased after Citizens United\n\nDont vote for him and then let Republicans of the future argue that he had bipartisan support. Chief Justice John Roberts was confirmed with bipartisan support (because he played the game of not talking about his judicial views) and later went on to be the decisive vote in the Citizens United decision.\n\nSimilarly, Gorsuch is a corporate candidate who is being backed by a $10 million dark money campaign. When asked about this by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Gorsuch equivocated:\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse: Is it any cause of concern to you that your nomination is the focus of a $10 million political spending effort and we dont know whos behind it? Neil Gorsuch: Senator, theres a lot about the confirmation process today that I regret.\n\nIn all likelihood, the money behind Gorsuch wants more favorable corporate rulings. Let Republicans own this.\n\n3. Democrats come together with Republicans to nominate Gorsuch\n\nIts hard to see why Democrats would do this but lets suppose they come together with Republicans because they feel hes a good candidate, or theyre worried about winning in a state won by Trump.\n\nAre they more or less likely to win re-election?\n\nYoure not going to win over the base of the Republican Party no matter what you do. Many Republicans these days are despised by the base. So theres no sense in working to win these people over.\n\nIndependents are looking for strong alternatives.\n\nDoes being a weak Republican look strong? As many GOP hardliners say, why vote for Republican-lite?\n\nEven in states won by Trump, politicians would be better off taking a principled stand. Heres what Mitch McConnell said about Merrick Garland when he came up for a vote:\n\nThe American people are perfectly capable of having their say on this issue, so let's give them a voice. Let's let the American people decide. The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next president nominates, whoever that might be.\n\nA similar approach regarding the Russia investigation seems logical. Something like:\n\nWith the President under investigation for his ties to Russia, its critical that the Supreme Court remain a check on his power. The Senate should revisit the matter at such time as all pending investigations are resolved.\n\nIf Republicans want to use the nuclear option, its on them.\n\nDemocrats, however, should at least fight and make them own their decisions. If Democrats fail to fight, they look weak and give credence to the both parties are the same nonsense.\n\nDavid Akadjian is the author of The Little Book of Revolution: A Distributive Strategy for Democracy (now available as an ebook).", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/26/1646389/-If-Democrats-fail-to-fight-Gorsuch-they-look-weak-and-share-the-blame-for-future-decisions#read-more", "date": "2017/3/26"}, {"text": "Settling in Canada was a symbolic gesture as well as a concrete effort to establish independent free black settlements. Shadd herself wrote of the hypocrisy of the United States, which had identified as a democracy, yet supported slavery. In Canada, part of the British monarchy, blacks would find political and economic freedom. One of the central goals of emigrationists was to establish independent black farming communities, free of white control. During her residence in Chatham, Ontario, Shadd struggled to keep her school afloat. She eventually abandoned teaching and turned to journalism, taking over the Provincial Freeman in Windsor, Ontario in 1853. As the primary editor of the Freeman, Shadd traveled throughout Ontario and parts of the United States in an effort to drum up subscriptions for the fledgling newspaper. In the process, she wrote essays about her travels, revealing her support for sex and race equality. After the Civil War and the death of her husband, Thomas Cary, Mary Shadd Cary returned to the United States, where she earned a law degree from Howard University. She died of stomach cancer in Washington, D.C. in 1893.\n\nShe was the second black woman to earn a law degree in the U.S.\n\nAt the age of 60 she became only the second Black woman in the United States to earn a law degree behind Charlotte E. Ray, also a Howard University School of Law graduate. Shadd Cary, post-slavery, adopted women's rights as one of her causes. In her later years she began working alongside Susan B. Anthony in the National Woman Suffrage Association, even testifying before the House of Representatives for women's right to vote. Mary Ann Shadd Cary would eventually become the first Black woman to vote in a national election due to her efforts.\n\nWhile Annie and Mary Ann were both both black women, their Canadian sojourns were very different. Though both ended up returning to the U.S., one fled north to escape brutality while the other went to Canada to fight against it.\n\nFor a detailed biography of Shadd Cary, a suggested read is Mary Ann Shadd Cary: The Black Press and Protest in the Nineteenth Century, by Jane Rhodes\n\n\"Rhodes provides a well-researched, balanced, clearly written assessment of the extraordinary life of this trailblazing African American feminist and reformer.\" Choice \"In this book we see how a courageous and pugnacious journalist-activist fought arduously to attain freedom from male dominance and establish a model for future feminists.\" Quill & Scroll \"Jane Rhodes' wonderful biography of Mary Ann Shadd Cary... is an insightful and moving portrait of a determined and resourceful Black woman who put all she had into ending slavery and securing full human rights for her people.\" Darlene Clark Hine Mary Ann Shadd Cary was a courageous and outspoken 19th-century African American who used the press and public speaking to fight slavery and oppression in the United States and Canada. Her life provides a window on the free black experience, emergent black nationalisms, African Americans gender ideologies, and the formation of a black public sphere\n\nReviewer Felecia Jones Ross writes:\n\nThis biography is a culmination of Jane Rhodes' years of scholarship on the Canadian antebellum African-American experience. The author's ability to piece together information from secondary sources and from Cary's scattered and incomplete writings represents what is required in producing African American historical scholarship. As a result, readers learn about the interactions between the different factions of free antebellum African American activists. Furthermore, readers see celebrated African American and white figures such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe from the perspective of Cary, who did not necessarily agree with their stances.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nIn her review in the Journal of Negro Education Jane Rhodes was critical of flaws in the scholarship in this biographical Canadian production about Shadd. But Im posting a clip because it includes interviews with some of Shadds descendants.\n\nThis documentary focuses on the 10-year period when Shadd Cary lived in Canada, and it uses her life to illustrate the experiences of African Canadians in the 1850s. Translating this story onto film is a difficult task as there are few photographs to illustrate the narrative, and limited documentary sources. Thus, this filmmaker resorts to historical reenactment to create some visual impact. Actors portray Shadd Cary and her associates, while a narrator tells the story. The film does a good job of explaining some of the issues confronting these Black communities established by missionaries and settled by former slaves. The film also does its best to evoke Shadd Cary's distinctive, and often radical, political voice as she fought against slavery and discrimination, and championed the cause of Black emigration. Perhaps most interesting are the interviews with Shadd Cary's descendants, who give a contemporary face to the African Canadian presence.\n\nThere is not a lot of visual material available on Shadd. This film was made as a result of some of Shadds letters being found in a family home which was being demolished.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nThe films title is Mary Ann Shadd Revisited: Echoes from an Old House.\n\nThis film, by Allison Margot Smith, is about a collection of letters to and from African American abolitionist Mary Ann Shadd between 1851 and 1863  years that she lived in Canada. The letters were left in her house near Chatham Ontario when she returned to the U.S.A. and were eventually forgotten. They were accidentally rediscovered in 1974 by the then owners of her house, when they had the house torn down, just before the rubble was burned. When offered, the letters were accepted by Archives of Ontario for preservation. The premise of Smiths film is that, had the letters been found before the 1960s, they might not have been offered to, or accepted by the Archives. She argues that it was the emergence in the 1960s of ideas about Social History, the Civil Rights Movement and the Womens Movement that led the owners of the letters and the Archives to realize their importance.\n\nYou can read more on Smiths thoughts on making the film here.\n\nWhile exploring Shadd, I encountered the histories of black settlements in Canadawhich she critiqued.\n\nShadd used her newspaper to comment on all aspects of black life in Canada, but she focused especially on problems of racial discrimination and segregation. She assailed anyone, blacks and whites alike, who sought to compromise with slavery, and she particularly castigated her fellow blacks who were prepared to accept second-class status. She reserved her greatest vituperation, however, for self-segregated black settlements: to her, these settlements only fostered discrimination, and she urged blacks to seek assimilation into Canadian society. John Scoble and Josiah Henson of the Dawn settlement were pilloried almost as exhaustively as Bibb, while grudging approval was granted to the Elgin settlement under William King.\n\nWhat was the Elgin Settlement?\n\nReverend William King, a Presbyterian minister trained in Scotland, married a Southern belle in Louisiana where he had been teaching. Upon the deaths of his wife, child, and later his father-in-law, King, an abolitionist, found himself the owner of a number of slaves. He opposed slavery, but he could neither sell them nor leave them since they would be re-enslaved, so he opted to take them to Canada West where the Presbyterian Church had placed him. He arranged for the fertile lands near Chatham, Ontario to be purchased through the Elgin Association. King, along with the 15 former enslaved Africans, formed the Elgin Settlement, or Buxton. The new residents were provided with many rules and advice about how to create and sustain the community. The school he operated provided a high level of education with graduates going on to study at the University of Toronto. The success of this Black community in agriculture, coupled with the reputation of the school, led to a rise in the population. By the 1860s at least 2,000 people lived there. The success of this Black settlement has been commemorated; it is now a national historic site, a cultural landscape of early African-Canadian life preserved in rural Ontario.\n\nI have not yet found a record yet of my great-aunt Annie in Canada while wading through the materials now available online about the numerous black settlements that flourished there. But Im grateful that searching for her led me to Shadd. Perhaps future research on black womens experiences in Canada will eventually lead me to a record of Annies time there.\n\nWomens history may be only one month long on the calendar, but for me it is important all year round.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/26/1609444/-Mary-Ann-Shadd-Cary-black-suffragist-abolitionist-publisher-and-lawyer#read-more", "date": "2017/3/26"}, {"text": "Jennifer Rubin is the first of several Republicans getting ink-space this week, because of outstanding internecine warfare.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D.

Another one used to live two doors further down, but she and her husband managed to sell their house just before the real estate market went belly up here in Los Angeles. That good fortune has meant I've gotten to rub elbows with Solis at a few private parties. I won't reveal any secrets. Everybody already knows she's smart, tough, and the most liberal member of President Obama's Cabinet. A friend of working Americans since before she was appointed Secretary of Labor. A friend of labor unions before she was a Congresswoman.

You can find our master list of states here, which we'll be updating as we add new states; you can also find all our data from 2016 and past cycles here.\n\nDemocrats lost control of both chambers of the legislature in 2010, and the new GOP majorities quickly did all they could to make sure Team Blue never returned to power. Last year, a federal court ruled that the Republicans illegally packed African American voters into several seats in order to strengthen Republicans elsewhere, and they ordered the state to redraw several legislative districts and hold new elections in 2017. However, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay, and they have not yet announced if or when theyll take up the case.\n\nFor now, its unclear if the GOPs map will remain intact, or if there will be a new one in place this fall or next year. North Carolina does not allow its governor to veto redistricting whatsoever, so if the GOP legislature has to come up with new districts, there isnt anything Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper can do to stop them from devising the strongest gerrymander they think the court will tolerate.\n\nThe GOP currently holds a 35-15 Senate majority and a 74-46 edge in the House. The GOP can override Coopers vetoes with three-fifths of the vote in each chamber, so Democrats need to net six Senate seats or three House districts to take away Team Reds supermajority. The North Carolina GOP legislature is one of the most reactionary in the nation, and Democrats would be delighted if they can stop them from passing more bills like the notorious anti-LGBT HB2. However, that wont be easy. While Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in North Carolina by a close 50.5-46.8 margin, he won 31 of the 50 Senate seats and 76 of the 120 House seats. All the districts in both chambers are up every two years.\n\nIf Democrats can win all the Clinton seats in the Senate and take just two Trump districts, theyd be able to strip the GOP of their supermajority there.

Special elections do not provide a years plus notice. As a result, the time that would be used to conduct a longstanding air war or to conduct an earned media campaign gets much more difficult. While those elements will still be important, the compressed schedule means that direct outreach through an effective field plan skyrockets.\n\nSpecial election turnouts are often significantly lower than all other scheduled elections. The general rule of thumb is that a special election turnout runs about 70 percent or less of a non-presidential year turnout. As a result, making sure that you get your voters to the poll is the most important element in a special election, and so an active field plan becomes job number one.\n\nThis year, outrage among the Democratic faithful is helping to change this traditionally accepted model. Jeff Singer here at Daily Kos, highlights the change in one market:\n\nThis one is a done deal: with only one precinct to go, the margin is still 59-41, a raw vote edge of over 2100 votes. Side note: turnout in this Saturday special election is likely to eclipse the district turnout in the 2014 general election, the last election in this particular legislative district. Both a U.S. Senate and U.S. House race were on the ballot on that day.\n\nWith upcoming races in Kansas, Georgia, and Montana, as well as special election state & local races in numerous states, like Missouri, we get a test of how well a campaigns field efforts have worked out for them. Can campaigns in Kansas, Montana, and Georgia capitalize on the energy? Well, the only way to do that for sure is through an aggressive field campaign, as the compressed schedule makes other traditional efforts tricky to implement.\n\nRegistration services\n\nCampaigns taking part in a special election effort will often pay special attention to new voter registration and address moves. This is due to the fact that according to the National Realtors association and others, spring is often peak buying and selling time for a home. It is also the time period where more people decide to move.\n\nThis means that those same individuals will need to be re-registered as a voter, or can be registered for the first time inside your district.\n\nSpecial elections provide not just the campaign, but the party, a chance to clean up data and make sure their voters are registered for future elections at their new residence.\n\nWhile keeping track and working to make sure our voters are registered is an ongoing effort, special elections often provide a unique opportunity to allow a party and campaign the chance to identify voters and make sure they dont just vote in the special election, but that they are part of the party building efforts for the future.\n\nTrying something new? Special elections are often ideal.\n\nMany special elections, thanks to gerrymandering, are seen as done-deal races before they happen. This is especially true in cases where a Republican or Democratic candidate is picked to serve in a state or federal administration and chosen from a safe district.\n\nThese races present opportunities to try new techniques with very little riskif you know the odds are strongly for or against your candidate, why not use this opportunity to try new technologies, outreach efforts, or be a test subject for campaign strategies?\n\nThese test runs can often help establish future adoption of technology or prevent adoption of bad strategies. Through special elections, open testing of digital campaign access, like MobileVAN and Organizer came to light. In special elections, candidates tried and tested ad buys on alternative media networks, as well as running atypical candidates who might appeal to different voters.\n\nSpecial elections can be a great trial balloon to find outwith minimal risk and lots of upsidehow you might proceed going into the next special election.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSpecial elections, due to their compressed timeframe, should make Democratic party members unhappy with unlimited money in campaigns happy. The time frame means that massive amounts of money would be difficult (though not impossible) to spend, and as a result, a strong ground game and direct voter outreach will be the most important element.\n\nSpecial elections also give an opportunity to evaluate new or young campaign staff and see how they react and work with the candidate or party. Many great campaign minds have been given their first opportunity through a special election, and identifying them and being able to hold onto those staff members for the next election certainly benefits the state and national party.\n\nWith multiple special elections at the federal and state level upcoming, there are plenty of opportunities for you to make an impact nationally. Whether you want to phone bank for James Thompson in Kansas, or send some mail on behalf of Rob Quist in Montana, or just spread the word about Jon Osoff, youll find that you as an interested party can make a lot more impact in a traditionally low turnout race.\n\nAnd the biggest way you can do that is by following up on what happened in New Hampshire, and making sure that for the Democratic candidate, the traditional low-turnout doesnt happen.\n\nNext Week on Nuts & Bolts: the power of city & county offices.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/25/1646823/-Nuts-amp-Bolts-the-guide-to-a-Democratic-campaign-What-can-special-elections-teach-us#read-more", "date": "2017/3/25"}, {"text": "After Himselfs bigly humiliation on DontCare yesterday, he shrugged and hit the links, vowing to move on to what he and his party want us to call tax reform.\"\n\nNot gonna do it.

The Center for Global Policy Solutions has a report on autonomous vehicles, driving jobs, and the future of work, laying out the likely employment effects of such a shift and offering policy suggestions to protect workers during that transition.\n\nMore than four million jobs will likely be lost with a rapid transition to autonomous vehicles, according to the report.

They number about 6.5 times the share of the working female population in driving occupations and earn 64 percent more than women in these jobs. Although nearly as many women as men are bus drivers, men are the vast majority of those employed as delivery and heavy truck drivers and as taxi drivers and chauffeurs.

However, Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, groups who are overrepresented in these occupations and who earn a driving premiuma median annual wage exceeding what they would receive in non-driving occupationswould also be hard hit. With 4.23 percent of Black workers employed in driving occupations, Blacks rely on driving jobs more than other racial/ethnic groups.

They compete with the resident Annas hummingbirds all summer, who likely give a big sigh of relief when they have the yard (and feeders) to themselves in winter. The first Rufous appeared on March 12 this year, later than usual, possibly because weve had a very cool grey spring so far. All the flowering plants that hummingbirds feed on are several weeks late in blooming so the hummers depend on the feeders outside my windows for now. For 5 days Mr Rufous was the only one, and then several more arrived. Things were fairly peaceable at the feeder for a few days. Its typical for the males to arrive first, staking out breeding territories. The females should be along any time.\n\nMarker at top of Sassafras Mountain, South Carolina.\n\nforesterbob writesThe Daily Bucket: Brasstown Bald, the highest peak in Georgia: Sometimes it takes a visitor to force me to explore the natural wonders of the Southeast. When Im in Georgia, I tend to stay within a two-hour drive of home. The mountains in the northern part of the state are great places to explore, but getting there can be an ordeal, as many of the routes require me to navigate the entire Atlanta metro area from south to north. Within the mountains, highways twist through built-up valleys, and have their own traffic problems. [...] Earlier this month, my sister and her husband visited from Nevada. They teamed up with my brothers family from the Atlanta area, and spent a week exploring Georgia and the Carolinas. My sister has a passion for climbing peaks (the non-technical ones) and has recently become interested in the Highpointers Club whose members strive to reach the summits of the highest point in each state, whether it be Floridas Britton Hill at 345 feet, or Alaskas Denali at 20,320 feet. It was only natural that wed end up atop Sassafras Mountain in South Carolina (3,553 feet), and Brasstown Bald in Georgia (4,784 feet).

Viewed from the valleys, the clouds were unspectacular. From the top of Brasstown Bald, it was a different story. At that elevation, the bottoms of the clouds were close, perhaps a few hundred feet above us. They were moving fast, and constantly twisting into fascinating shapes. Some formations looked a bit like funnels, but this was clearly not tornado weather. Having no need to run and hide, I took a lot of pictures.

A heck of alot of rural people in Alaska, Alaskan Natives no less, some of the most vulnerable populations imaginable, are largely dependent on government largess. Now my fellow Democrats want to reduce the very food these people harvest from the land as they have been doing for millennia uncounted. It simply defies belief.

Every year, ice floating in the Arctic Ocean grows and shrinks with the season. The center has calculated that this year ice in the Arctic Ocean reached its maximum extent on March 7 and has now begun its decline, headed toward its minimum extent around Sept 10-15. That maximum registered at its lowest level in the 38-year satellite record. Contributing to this, according to NSIDC scientists, was a very warm autumn and winter with air temperatures 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit above average over the Arctic Ocean. In addition to this general warmth, there were several extreme winter heat-waves over the ocean for the second winter in a row. The maximum has been declining by 2.8 percent a decade since 1979, and the minimum has been declining 13.8 percent a decade.

The Siberian Times reports that over 200 lakes have been identified in the thermokarst landscape of Siberia that are bubbling methane. This landscape is full of water from thawing permafrost consisting mainly of marshes. It is also full of craters called pingos, trembling earth and lakes. The permafrost soil consists of vast amounts of organic material such as plants and the rotting carcasses of mammoth, horse and other ancient plains species. Once the permafrost thaws, the soil decomposes and releases into the atmosphere the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gases heat the earth which causes even more warming, which in turn releases even more gases from the permafrost in a vicious cycle called a feedback loop.\n\nboatsie writesKitchen Table Kibitzing: Young Climate Activists Take On Climate Change: Note: Tonight Im going to share this story about the current project my nonprofit 2050kids is working on.

To put the 2017 prediction in context, consider that this years projected fish run is substantially smaller than the actual number of Chinook salmon that made it to the spawning grounds in 2002, when up to 60,000 fish died from disease. The collapse is going to have dramatic implications for the regions recreational and commercial salmon industries and even worse implications for the Yurok and other Tribes.

But there is one bit of news that indicates things may actually beat the current, most dire, predictions. The amount of new coal power being built around the world fell by nearly two-thirds last year, prompting campaigners to claim the polluting fossil fuel was in freefall. The rapid rise of low-cost natural gas had already swept every planned coal plant into the dustbin in the United States.

Solar power provides only about 1 percent of the country's energy, and an even smaller percentage in Indiana. But the industry's recent rapid growth has traditional power utilities worried that it could eventually eat away at their business.

That statement likely influenced FBI and US Dept. of Justice investigators reviewing the expenditures of her inaugural funds in 2015, law enforcement sources say. Now former staffers who raised funds and assisted in the transition and inauguration say Governor Martinez was not telling the truth in that statement. At issue appear to be more than $57,000 Martinez said she made Jay McCleskey, her former campaign manager and advisor, take for inaugural services and how the committee spent hundreds-of-thousands of the almost $1 million they raised from private entities to interview candidates for cabinet appointments and Martinez official staff. For her first inauguration, Martinezs team raised almost $1 million from private entities, with almost half of that money coming from corporate donations exceeding $10,000 each. The inaugural committee, led by former Sen. Pete Domenici was supposed to raise money for the inaugural expenses  not the transition, the New Mexican reports. Steven Steffens at Leftwing Cracker of Tennessee writesI am not laughing at the idea of Mae Beavers running for Governor: And, neither should YOU. The Nashville Scene broke a story today that indicates State Senator Mae Beavers (R-Mt. Juliet, Senate 17) is considering a run for Governor of Tennessee next year.\n\nNow, while you and I may think she is crazier than a betsy bug, and with documented reason, remember that this is a state where this HELPS you in a GOP campaign, and is a feature, not a bug. Considering that Randy Boyd, former director Commerce and Development for Bill Haslam (and who has all but stated he plans to be Haslam 2.0) has announced, and Speaker Beth Harwell is seriously considering the race, the announcement that State Senator Mark Green (R-Clarksville) is up for Trump Secretary of the Army, means that the hardcore right needs their slot filled. Mae Beavers is the Trumpiest of all the Trumpites, and could very easily win a primary despite having less money than either Boyd or Harwell. Congresswoman Diane Black was rumored to be making the GOP race, but with the GOP expected to hold the US House for another election or two, she may be less inclined to do anything but run for re-election. So, go again and check out that link to Google above about the State Senator, and tell me again how you would like her to run. Do you REALLY think she wouldn't beat a rich white guy from Knoxville (Boyd) in the primary, and potentially a rich white guy from Nashville (Karl Dean) in the general? Truth be told, that is one of the reasons I am hoping House Democratic Leader Craig Fitzhugh (D-Ripley) runs for Governor, because he could undercut her in rural areas while carrying urban areas.

Walden is one of the architects the GOP plan. A congressional committee he chairs unveiled the plan a couple of weeks ago. Not only would the GOP plan hit Oregon, by one measure, harder than all but one state, Waldens district would suffer the most out of Oregons five congressional districts.

What if its ongoing?\n\nLets engage in some scary speculation.

Asa Hutchinson will almost certainly soon sign. Republicans had passed a similar measure in 2013, but the state Supreme Court struck it down in 2014 for violating the state constitution, in part because the law was not passed with a two-thirds majority. However, now that Republicans have legislative supermajorities, they believe their latest version will survive judicial review.\n\n Georgia: The Republican-dominated state Senate approved a bill that would reject voter registration applications unless the information provided strictly matches state or federal records, such as those tied to the persons drivers license or Social Security number. If the information isnt an exact match, they could only cast a provisional ballot, and their application could be denied if they dont clear up any discrepancy.\n\nRepublicans claim that this provision is necessary to combat fraud, but the information from these federal and state databases is often notoriously unreliable and prone to data-entry errors. Thats particularly so for groups like black voters, who are more likely to have symbols like hyphens in their names.\n\nVoting rights advocates had sued Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp for violating federal law over using a strict-matching system when conducting purges of registration rolls in 2016. Kemp had agreed to a settlement in February that seemingly prevented Republicans from using an exact-matching system, but this bill appears to directly undermine that agreement. Since Republicans wield unified control over state government, opponents will likely have to resort to another lawsuit to try to stop it.\n\n Iowa: With little surprise, Iowa Republicans have used the state Senate majority they gained last year to pass a new voter ID bill, sending it back to the state House after they passed slight amendments. With the Republican-led House likely to approve the bill once again, and GOP Gov. Terry Branstad in support, its likely just a matter of time before this bill becomes law. In addition to requiring voters to show either a valid photo ID or their state issued voter verification card, the bill abolishes the straight-ticket voting option.\n\nRepublicans have pushed that latter change in several states in part because it increases the time it takes for each voter to cast a ballot, which can lead to longer lines. While Iowa is an overwhelmingly white state, longer lines could disproportionately affect black and Latino voters, since those demographics are more likely to vote a straight ticket. Removing the option could also lead to more voters undervoting in downballot races.\n\n New Hampshire: Republican state senators advanced a bill out of committee that could prevent Democratic-leaning demographics like college students from voting. Current law allows any eligible voter living in the state to vote as long as they dont do so in another state, too. However, the latest GOP proposal would tighten residency requirements for voting by mandating voters provide more proof documenting that they intend to live in the state long-term.\n\nAfter an outcry that it could lead to voter intimidation, the bills sponsor removed a provision that would have allowed election supervisors to send the police to a voters home to verify their residency, but the proposal would still allow election officials to check on voters themselves. Republicans hold the governors office and modest majorities in both legislative chambers, meaning there is likely little Democrats can do to stop this bill.\n\n North Carolina: After Democrat Roy Cooper ousted then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016, North Carolinas Republican legislature used their illegally gerrymandered majority to engage in a flagrantly undemocratic power grab in a lame-duck session right before McCrory left office. Among their many changes, they removed the governors authority to name all members on every state and county elections board to prevent Democrats from gaining control of them. Late last week, a state court panel ruled that this change violated the state constitutions separation of powers, dealing a major victory for voting rights.\n\nUnder McCrory, Republicans had used their majorities on the state and county boards to ram through a slew of voter suppression efforts in tandem with a voting law so restrictive that a court said it targeted black voters with almost surgical precision. These boards cut early voting hours and limited the locations where it would be offered. They also redrew precinct boundaries and moved polling places away from locations such as college campuses and predominantly black communities. These changes were all part of an attempt to make it more difficult or time-consuming for Democratic-leaning demographics to cast a ballot.\n\nThe governor appoints all members of each board under the current law, while their party is limited to a one-seat majority. Republicans had attempted to create even-numbered boards where the legislature would pick half the members and the parties would be evenly divided. Their change also required a supermajority to take action, while they gave Republicans the chairmanships during state and federal election years. Doing so would have allowed Republicans to veto any of Gov. Coopers efforts to have the boards undo any of McCrorys voter suppression efforts, but new Democratic majorities hopefully will now be able to do so soon.\n\nAnother major prong of the Republican attack on the rule of law was to dramatically reduce the number of executive branch appointees who serve at the pleasure of the governor, effectively preventing Cooper from firing hundreds of political staffers McCrory had appointed to state agencies. The court once again deemed this unconstitutional, giving the governor more control over the executive branch.\n\nThe courts ruling wasnt a complete victory for Cooper, however. They upheld the legislatures unprecedented switch to requiring state Senate approval for cabinet appointees. Although this provision had never been implemented before, this ruling was more to be expected, since the state constitution more explicitly indicated that the legislature had that authority. Finally, a separate lawsuit is still in progress against Republicans effort to remove the governors control over state Board of Education and University of North Carolina system appointments.\n\nRepublicans could attempt to pass a new law that would cut early voting via statute instead of relying on the state board of elections. However, that could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, and Republicans are currently dealing with the fallout of trying to appeal 2016s 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that struck down their sweeping 2013 voter suppression law.\n\nRepublican legislators will undoubtedly appeal Fridays ruling all the way to the North Carolina state Supreme Court. However, after Democrats gained a 4 to 3 majority in a crucial 2016 judicial race, Coopers chance of success appears strong. Furthermore, the section of the lower courts ruling dealing with the elections boards was itself unanimous and bipartisan, meaning theres no guarantee that the Supreme Courts three Republican members will even side with the legislature.\n\nRedistricting\n\n Florida: Sunshine State voters approved two state constitutional amendment ballot initiatives in 2010 that imposed limits on partisan gerrymandering, but Republican legislators promptly ignored them and passed maps to favor themselves ahead of the 2012 elections. That led to successful but drawn out litigation that finally resulted in the state Supreme Court requiring new maps in 2016, which led to Republicans losing multiple congressional seats that they might otherwise have won.\n\nAs payback, on Tuesday Republicans used their state Senate majority to pass a bill on a party-line vote that attempts to place restrictions on how judges can deal with redistricting-related lawsuits. One provision would require that, once the early spring filing deadline passes, a map cant be thrown out until the next election cycle if a lawsuit arises. Another measure would force courts to hold public hearings and accept public submissions before imposing any new map.\n\nRedistricting litigation often moves very slowly, and it oftentimes isnt feasible to challenge a map the instant a legislature passes it. Additionally, its sometimes impractical for a court to hold public hearings over a remedy if theres an election swiftly approaching. Both of these provisions are thus nothing more than an attempt to allow Republicans to get away with illegal gerrymanders for at least one or more election cycles per decade like they did after 2010, demonstrating why Florida reformers need to use initiatives to create an independent redistricting commission once and for all.\n\n Georgia: Early in March and without warning, Georgias heavily Republican state House rammed through a bill to re-gerrymander several of their own vulnerable districts. Redistricting normally only takes place once each decade immediately after the census, and this egregiously undemocratic action drew sharp outcry from Democrats and voting rights groups, who threatened lawsuits against the new maps apparent use of the same sort of racial gerrymandering that federal courts have invalidated in several major rulings in recent years.\n\nRepublican legislators have now backed down somewhat from their earlier bill by dropping proposed changes to four of the districts that seemed most likely to invite legal challenges over race. However, the state Senate nonetheless passed a revised bill out of committee on a party-line vote that redraws the lines in five Republican-held House seats in Atlantas northern suburbs, which is a historically GOP region that swung hard against Trump in 2016. While this amended bill isnt quite as extreme, its still little more than an attempt by Republican legislators to nullify elections when the results displease them.\n\n Maryland: Marylands staunchly Democratic state legislature killed a redistricting reform proposal from Republican Gov. Hogan, which would have created a commission to handle the process rather than leave it up to the partisan majority in the legislature. Maryland is one of the very few states that Democrats gerrymandered after the 2010 census, and Republicans will undoubtedly try to point to this development as a gotcha moment of hypocrisy by Democrats. However, Maryland Democrats expressly offered a different way forward on reform that would be far fairer.\n\nIn the 2010s round of redistricting, Republicans drew more than five times as many congressional districts nationally as Democrats, and this disparity consequently helped the GOP win a House majority despite losing the popular vote in 2012. While nonpartisan redistricting would make Marylands maps fairerand Marylands gerrymander isnt anywhere near as partisan as many Republican ones to begin withit would exacerbate the Republican bias nationally when scores of GOP-drawn states like Texas dont follow suit.\n\nRecognizing this disparate impact, Marylands Democratic state legislative leadership threw their support behind a plan that would agree to pass redistricting reform in Maryland only if a handful of other states in the Mid-Atlantic region do so as well, including a few Republican-drawn ones. If Republicans like Hogan are serious about fighting to make elections fairer overall rather than simply using piecemeal reform as an excuse to further disadvantage Democrats, they should get behind a regional attempt at nonpartisan redistricting.\n\nBallot Initiatives\n\n Arizona: After progressives scored key recent ballot initiative wins like raising the minimum wage to $12-an-hour by 2020, Arizona Republicans have plotted several proposed changes to make it far more difficult to put measures on the ballot in the first place. On Thursday, GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill that would ban paying initiative petition-circulators on a per-signature basis, forcing campaigns to pay by the hour or rely on volunteers. This would likely make signature-gathering significantly harder because it would kill the monetary incentive for circulators to obtain as many signatures as possible.\n\nIn a grating display of cynicism, Republicans claimed that this change was needed to prevent fraud and out-of-state influence, but they expressly didnt want to ban paying per signature when candidates themselves sought to qualify for the ballot, demonstrating how nonsensical their justification was. Republicans are still debating three other restrictions on the initiative process, but those proposals would all require subsequent voter approval, unlike this change. Those who support the initiative process might once again have to use a ballot referendum itself to fight this latest law.\n\nJudicial Elections\n\n North Carolina: Republican legislators have gone to extremes to undermine newly elected Democratic Gov. Roy Coopers powers (see our North Carolina item above), so its no surprise that they have used their supermajorities to override his first veto to change election laws. Their new measure reintroduces partisan affiliation for local trial court judicial races, which legislators had previously made nonpartisan in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Republicans hope that making these elections partisan will help them oust Democratic and moderate judges in Republican-leaning and conservative areas.\n\nInjecting partisanship into judicial races is far from the worst thing North Carolina Republicans have donethere are, after all, decent arguments for giving voters more information about candidates, of which partisan affiliation is a key piecebut whats more concerning is how and why they are doing this. Their majorities are only narrowly veto-proof thanks to gerrymanders that were ruled unconstitutional in mid-2016. Rather than require new districts last year, the federal courts might not force maps until 2018, leaving illegally elected Republicans free to override the fairly elected Democratic governors vetoes.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans seem to believe that partisan affiliation is useful solely because it will help them win elections, following several high-profile defeats in nonpartisan state Supreme Court races, which they recently made partisan again following 2016. Of course, that could easily backfire in Democratic-favoring election years or districts, which is why one Republican state senator wants to split up countywide judicial districts in populous Democratic-leaning counties, allowing Republicans to gerrymander them and keep several of their judges there.\n\nThe judicial gerrymandering bills sponsor even acknowledged that its straight-up political, likely in an attempt to avoid a lawsuit over racial discrimination. However, that brazen display of anti-democratic sentiment could still open up the proposal to legal challenge, since a 2016 federal court ruling against Republicans broad voter suppression law essentially held that harming black voters solely because doing so had a partisan advantage was racially discriminatory even without racial animus. Furthermore, if the Supreme Court imposes new limits on partisan gerrymandering, Republicans just left a smoking gun.\n\nVoting Access and Registration\n\n Delaware: Delaware Democrats recently retained complete control over the state government in a key February state Senate election, and some legislators now want the party to finally use their majorities to improve the blue states surprisingly restrictive voting laws. One bill would establish 10 days of early voting, while another would automatically register eligible voters who do business with the Department of Motor Vehicles unless they opt out. A third bill would consolidate state primaries with the presidential ones instead of holding them separately, which could lead to much higher downballot participation in presidential years.\n\nDelaware is one of just 13 states that offers neither in-person early voting nor excuse-free absentee ballots. Additionally, it doesnt allow same-day registration like a few of the other 13 states do. Easing access to registration and allowing voters to cast a ballot before election day could consequently make it much easier to vote for particular demographics like working-class or young people, meaning these reforms could both increase turnout and cut down on waiting times for those who do vote.\n\n Hawaii: Hawaii frequently ranks dead last in terms of eligible voter turnout, and some lawmakers in Americas bluest state want to change that. The state House approved a bill in early March that would switch the state entirely to vote-by-mail by 2020, which is how nearly every voter casts a ballot in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, states that have some of the highest turnout rates. There are literally no Republicans in the state Senate, so its just a matter of Democrats getting their act together to pass this bill into law. If they do, Hawaii would send every registered voter a ballot via the postal system.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/25/1646961/-Voting-Rights-Roundup-Following-GOP-veto-Nevadans-to-vote-on-automatic-voter-registration-in-2018#read-more", "date": "2017/3/25"}, {"text": "Jeet Heer/New Republic:\n\nThe Death of Paul Ryan, Policy Genius He's always been more con artist than wonk.

The bill would have resulted in individual insurance premiums rising 15 to 20 percent in the short term, and some 14 million people losing their insurance as of next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A final amendment of the bill, released late last night, might have sent the individual market into a complete and immediate meltdown. The bill failed in part because it could not establish a balance between the concerns of moderate Republicans, particularly with regard to the way it treated the Medicaid expansion, and more conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus, who argued that the bill was too much like Obamacare, retaining its core scheme of subsidies and regulations. But it also failed because Trump proved himself an ineffective negotiator and dealmakerone whose preference for shallow political victories over substantive policy wins ultimately proved insufficient in a complex policy negotiation.\n\nx 230 Republicans still voted for the rule on the AHCA.

The outsider approach to lobbying grew from there, in ways that quickly came to worry Republicans. Indivisible-affiliated groups advertised congressional town halls and flooded them. Like the Jan. 14 rallies, the town hall tactic mirrored what the tea party movement did in 2009. Like the Democrats of that year, many Republicans responded glibly, blaming out-of-state (or district) rabble-rousers and searching for the invisible hand of George Soros. Among the Republicans who took the protests seriously was Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who would go on to oppose AHCA from the right. I dont know if were going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active, Brooks told a radio host in February.

Trumps reported pledge to support primary challenges against Republican holdouts is, in a way, a potent one. Conservative members who balk at voting for a bill their constituents see as too liberal arent going to be punished for voting their principles. Voters may be persuaded to abandon their representatives, however, if the issue isnt the GOPs health care bill but a litmus test measuring loyalty to President Trump. That threat only works if the American Health Care Act is seen as a proxy for Trump, and that means the president has to endorse it enthusiastically. Hes done just that. Whether the White House likes it or not, its TrumpCare from this point forward.

Thats because the House GOP health plan reduces revenues by nearly $900 billion over the decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), including $592 billion in tax cuts largely for the wealthy. Passing these tax cuts now as part of a health package allows the GOP to offset their cost through cuts to health care spending  particularly in Medicaid, which CBO estimates the House health care bill cuts by $880 billion over ten years. If these tax cuts were part of tax reform legislation rather than being in the health bill, Republican leaders would have to offset their cost on the tax side to maintain revenue neutrality, as they have said they would do, limiting how sharply they can cut tax rates. Instead, because these tax cuts are in the health bill, Republicans can, in writing their tax bill later this year, make much deeper cuts in tax rates  particularly for corporations  than they otherwise could do.\n\nx One piece of this health-care debate that hasn't received enough attention: GOP acts like it has a broad mandate when it doesn't\n\n\n\n1/10  Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) March 24, 2017\n\nAxios:\n\nWhatever the outcome today, it's bad for House Republican leadership in general and for Paul Ryan specifically. Outcome 1: Trump cuts a deal with Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows, effectively hijacking the floor and the policy agency. Trump will have learned that if he wants to get anything done, he needs to deal directly with these guys. Meadows will have proven that he can keep his ultra-conservative caucus, which many expected to crack up now that Trump is president, together under the pressure. Option 2: Trump can't cut a deal with the Freedom Caucus and the bill fails. This is also terrible for leadership. It would show that Ryan oversees a truly ungovernable conference. Also consider: No matter the outcome of today, Breitbart will go thermonuclear against Ryan. The website's biggest goal, shared by a number of members of the Freedom Caucus, is to remove the Speaker.

It was specious, libelous and reckless, regardless of the weak revelations of incidental collection that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump transition team member Devin Nunes outrageously made public, briefing the president without first briefing his fellow committee members. Nuness announcement was a bombshell with no bomb, just enough mud in the water to obscure the blood in the water for those too willfully blind to discern the difference. Second, Donald Trump will never apologize. Trumps strategy for dealing with being caught in a lie is often to tell a bigger lie. He seems constitutionally incapable of registering what others would: shame, embarrassment, contrition. Something is broken in the man  definitely morally and possibly psychologically.\n\nx 1.

At The Nation, she writesStarting to mitigate Americas yawning class divide is exactly what the ACA did. And thats exactly what the Republican plan would undo:\n\n[...] Contrast that with the responses to the ACAs expansion of Medicaid, a program that today covers over 70 million children, adults, people with disabilities, and seniorsone in five Americans. A just-released Kaiser tracking poll found that 84 percent of those surveyed believed it was important for states that expanded Medicaid with federal funds to continue to receive those funds, including 69 percent of Republicans. While only 12 percent of Americans said they wanted to see Medicaid funding decreased, nearly half (48 percent) wanted the funding to stay the same, and more than a third (36 percent) wanted to see it increased. Faced with Republican proposals to replace open-ended Medicaid funding with limited block grants or per-capita allotments to states, nearly two-thirds of Americans (65 percent) said that Medicaid should continue largely as it is today, with the federal government guaranteeing coverage for low-income people, setting standards for who states cover and what benefits people get, and matching state Medicaid spending as the number of people on the program goes up or down.\n\nAs for premium tax credits based on need, there have been complaints both from those who make too much to receive them and from those who receive them but feel they are insufficient. Still, few people favor abolishing them. A Kaiser poll in November 2016 found that 80 percent favored providing financial help to low- and moderate-income Americans who dont get insurance through their jobs to help them purchase coverage including 67 percent of Republicans.\n\nBut an even more telling finding emerged in January from a Pew Research Center survey. Asked if its the responsibility of the federal government to make sure that all Americans have health-care coverage, 60 percent of Americans said yesthe highest percentage in nearly a decade. While far more Democrats than Republicans agreed with that statement, there were significant changes by income: A majority of Republicans (52 percent) with annual incomes under $30,000 agreed with the proposition (up from 31 percent in 2016), as did over a third of Republicans making $30,000 to $74,999 (up from 14 percent in 2016). Those making the most (over $75,000) agreed the least: 18 percent, up from 16 percent the year before. Though two-thirds (67 percent) of Republicans said that the government doesnt have a responsibility to ensure health-care coverage, more than half (56 percent) said it should continue both Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThis picture speaks to a powerful coalition in the making. By guaranteeing coverage to a much larger share of the American public through Medicaid, and by convincing Americans of the justice implicit in the governments providing financial assistance to those who cant afford health insurance on their own, the ACA began to move us closer to a commitment to universal health care. While that term has become needlessly politicized, what it refers toquoting the World Health Organizationis simply a system in which all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. Ours is still a patchwork system, but its a system that Americans are increasingly committed to protecting. In late February, as congressional Republicans were readying their repeal and replace bill, the ACA reached its highest approval level ever: 54 percent, according to the latest Pew Research Center poll.

And yes, the lease says that elected officials can't profit from the arrangement. But it's all right because, and see if you can follow the logic here because it's a bit murky to us, he won't be able to directly pocket those untoward profits until he's back out of office.\n\nToday, Kevin Terry, a GSA contracting officer who oversaw the original contract negotiations with Trump, released a letter declaring that there was no reason for concern. In the letter, which is reprinted in its entirety below, Terry takes the position that there is no violation of the clause because the Trump Organization has been rearranged to steer any profits from the hotel away from Trump's bank accounts while he's in office. Trump owns more than 76 percent of the project; his children own the remainder. According to Terry's letter, the Trump Organization has presented documents to the GSA showing that although any profits (or losses) are accrued among the partners based on their ownership, any profits that would have gone to Trump himself will be kept separate and unavailable for Trump's personal use until he is out of office. Under the terms of the original agreement, Trump could have withdrawn money with ease, but the new corporate structure (established before Trump's inauguration) would prevent this, Terry wrote.\n\nGot that? All sides agree that Trump is an elected official, and will indeed be profiting off any decisions he makes or the company makes based on his status as an elected official, but it's fine because even though he might indeed be profiting off his status as president and as property owner he can't actually get his hands on those profits until he leaves officeupon which no harm, no foul.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/24/1646600/-GSA-rules-Trump-isn-t-violating-his-hotel-lease-because-he-promises-to-not-spend-the-profits-yet#read-more", "date": "2017/3/24"}, {"text": "James Merrick Smith and Hal F.B.

Great job there, management. Just great. We don't have them solely because of tragedy. We have them because workers have joined together and fought for them.

Mike Lee. At what point does this begin to get weird?\n\nThe conservative insistence that Scary Liberal Billionaire George Soros is behind every single non-conservative movement and organization in the world is, at this point, so endemic as to be the butt of jokes. The news that Republican lawmakers are now promoting Russian-promoted charges of Soros' supposed meddling in European politics is a bit more alarming.\n\nLed by Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the conservative lawmakers have signed on to a volley of letters accusing Soros of using his philanthropic spending to project his liberal sensibilities onto European politics. As Lee and other senators put it in a March 14 letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Soros Open Society Foundations are trying to push a progressive agenda and invigorate the political left. Its an accusation thats being fomented and championed by Moscow. Soros, who survived the Nazi occupation of his native Hungary and fled after World War II when it was under Soviet control, has been long a bte noire of the Kremlin, which sees his funding for civil society groups in former Soviet satellite states as part of a plot to install pro-Western governments.\n\nIn the past, Republicans have rather vigorously endorsed the notion of spreading democracy, and by vigorously we mean the last Republican administration launched a war based on the premise of forcibly spreading democracy to a nation that didn't much want it. Now, though, conservative senators like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz see Soros donations targeted against European nationalists as being far more sinister. They share this concern with Russian state-sponsored propaganda teams, who have sought to promote far-right nationalist movements throughout Europe in an effort to roll back western-styled reforms and revert to a more Moscow-amenable isolationism.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/24/1646258/-House-Senate-Republicans-repeat-Russian-attacks-against-liberal-U-S-billionaire-George-Soros#read-more", "date": "2017/3/24"}, {"text": "While Donald Trump was begging the Russians to dig into Hillary Clintons email, and members of Trumps staff were possibly in collusion with the Russian government to feed Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, the RNC was taking its own extraordinary approach to finding dirtand amazingly, it also had a Russian connection.\n\nAs the general election was taking shape last summer, the Republican National Committee initiated a series of payments to a low-profile firm started by retired Central Intelligence Agency officers that worked closely with an ex-Russian spy.

DHS lawyers also are examining federal privacy laws to determine ways to more freely share potentially incriminating personal information on immigrants among government agencies and release it publicly, including the nationality, immigration status and criminal history of those swept up in enforcement raids. And on Thursday, the Justice Department specifically highlighted immigration offenses and arrests during the release of its annual federal statistics report.\n\nWhen Trumps raids are sweeping up undocumented immigrants with no criminal record, you cannot understate the danger of releasing their personal information publicly to supporters who have already been committing acts of violence and harassment against immigrants and people of color in his name.\n\nChen asks: Why is this administration so hyper-focused on making the connection between crime and immigration?

Proportion of time interacting with each stimulus was recorded.Although there was clear individual variability in cat preference, social interaction with humans was the most-preferred stimulus category for the majority of cats, followed by food. This was true for cats in both the pet and shelter population. Future research can examine the use of preferred stimuli as enrichment in applied settings and assess individual cats motivation to work for their most-preferred stimulus as a measure of reinforcer efficacy.\n\n\n\n Life (and Near Death) in Space:\n\nWhile doing somersaults in zero G might not sound stressful, one has to consider that these astronauts are living in an extremely hostile, high-risk environmentthe smallest mistake could be the difference between life and death.

Sure they're taking away essential health benefits, the stuff that makes maternity and newborn health care available to all women, but that doesn't mean women can't get that coverage. They just can't be sluts and get it. In other, words they have to be married.\n\nIs the president concerned that without having those essential benefits you will have a situation where women are de facto paying higher insurance? Obviously they would be paying for maternity leave, the reporter asked as a follow up. No, you could have a family plan, Spicer replied. At best, Spicers answer is extraordinarily dismissive of single mothers  the reality is that not every woman who needs maternity care is going to be on a family plan, which are designed for couples and those with children or other dependents. At worst, its a tacit endorsement of only married women having access to affordable maternity care. Even if they got their insurance through a family plan, that family plan would still cost more if they wanted it to include maternity care. And, not all pregnancies are plannedwhich is why Obamacare treats it as an unexpected medical expense like any other.\n\nNot all families can afford insurance, either. There are plenty of couples out there where neither partner can get health insurance at workand there will probably be more if Trumpcare passesand plenty of families that have no coverage at all. Fewer since the Obamacare was signed into law, but still too many because of Republican governors and legislatures that refused to expand Medicaid.\n\nSingle moms? Working poor?

To placate \"moderates\" (people who might be okay with taking insurance away from 24 million people but see that it's bad to end drug treatment in the middle of an opioid epidemic and to take maternity and newborn care away) they added in a one-time $15 billion to the bill's $100 billion \"stability fund.\" That's what Republicans would have called a \"slush fund for insurance companies.\"\n\nAny moderate Republican who thinks this is going to make a bit of difference in the havoc this bill would wreak is an idiot or an ideologue.\n\nNo one should fall for it  a one-time $15 billion investment with little direction on how to spend the funds wouldnt come close to offsetting the enormous damage that the underlying House bill would do to millions of people who would lose these important categories of care. That's because the underlying House bill would increase the number of people without health insurance by 24 million by 2026, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, and it would have particularly harmful effects on access to treatment for mental illness and substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it effectively ends the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion, which has dramatically improved access to treatment; convert Medicaid to a per capita cap; and roll back requirements that health plans in the individual and small-group markets cover a list of \"essential health benefits\" that include behavioral health care, which encompasses treatment for mental illness and SUDs.\n\nBy the year 2020, experts estimate that spending under Obamacare for behavioral health will reach $7 billion per year. So the one-time $15 billion infusion Republicans are making wouldn't last much further than the next election, and certainly won't cover all the people that are in danger of overdosing in their own districts. Not when you add in all the women who are going to be needing health care for their pregnancies and their newborns.\n\nAnd if you pile Planned Parenthood defunding on top of that? A lot more women having unplanned pregnanciesseveral thousand, according to the CBO. The cost to Medicaid in 2017 alonethis year? About $21 million. That's $6 million more than the buy-off leadership is offering to the moderates. The $15 billion isnt going to go very far when these costs start adding up.

However, it sounds like one of the people we speculated would run as a Republican is actually a Democrat. Mark Johnston, who recently finished a 26-year stint as the executive director of the large Episcopalian-affiliated Camp McDowell, a large camp associated with the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, has expressed interest in seeking the governorship, though he didn't say what party he'd run with. However, the Daily Mountain Eagle identifies Johnston as a Democrat, and in a recent interview with Bham Now, Johnston sure didn't sound like a Republican.\n\nWhile Johnston did not say what his party affiliation was, he notably referred to the Republicans in the third person, declaring that if he becomes governor, he \"will work with Republicans because I want to.\" Bham Now also identified Johnston as \"a leader in Alabama's conservation and nature education communities for decades,\" which is also not exactly something you can say about many Republicans. (Hat-tip terjeanderson.)\n\nA few other candidates have made noises about running as Democrats. State House Minority Leader Craig Ford expressed interest back in October, while ex-state Supreme Court Justice Sue Bell Cobb and 2014 nominee and ex-Rep. Parker Griffith, a Democrat-turned Republican-turned independent-turned Democrat, have also talked about getting in. Plenty of Democrats would love for Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox to run, but he's given no indication that he's interested. It's going to be incredibly tough for any Democrat to win next year, but it's possible Team Blue will have an opening if they can run as an antidote to state GOP corruption.\n\n CO-Gov: Only two GOP candidates, Larimer County Commissioner Lew Gaiter and wealthy businessman Victor Mitchell, who served a single term in the state House nearly a decade ago, are in so far. However, Gaiter doesn't seem to have much major support, while Mitchell, who has spoken out against Trump, is a self-described \"longshot, outsider candidate.\" However, other Republicans are likely to join them in the race. Several months ago, we heard DaVita Healthcare Partners chief executive Kent Thiry mentioned as a possible candidate, and ColoradoPolitics reports he's \"said to be considering.\" DaVita was the second-largest kidney dialysis company in the world in 2012, and Thiry is known for some very memorable showmanship, including once zip-lining into a major company event. Thiry is wealthy and can presumably afford to self-fund if he gets in.\n\nState Attorney General Cynthia Coffman has been looking at a bid, and she told the Colorado Independent last month that she's asking questions about what a run would look like. Coffman has filed to seek re-election, but she can certainly change course if she wants. Suburban Denver District Attorney George Brauchler, who is best known for prosecuting the 2012 Aurora theater shooter, has been considering for a while, and Western Slope state Sen. Ray Scott has also expressed interest. State Treasurer Walker Stapleton, a member of the Bush family, has been publicly coy, but he seems to be working to make connections for a run.\n\n GA-Gov: House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is reportedly planning to run for the Democratic nomination next year, and 2014 nominee and ex-state Sen. Jason Carter has expressed interest in another bid. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that state Rep. Stacey Evans is \"seriously\" considering, though Evans has yet to say anything publicly. Evans, who is known for trying to restore funding cuts to the HOPE scholarship program, is a Carter ally, and the two are unlikely to run against each other. Ex-Gov. Roy Barnes, who says he'll back Carter if he runs again, is also close to Evans.\n\n IA-Gov: On Thursday, Democratic state Rep. Todd Prichard filed paperwork to raise money for a potential gubernatorial campaign, though he still says he's only considering getting in. Prichard would start out with very little name recognition, but Iowa Democratic leaders are reportedly excited about him. As Iowa Starting Line noted in a February profile, Prichard is an Iraq War veteran who has a rural and working class background, and he may be able to connect with voters who backed Trump last year.\n\nEx-Department of Natural Resources head Rich Leopold is the only Democrat who has declared he's in, and other candidates are eyeing this race. Ex-state party head Andy McGuire reportedly has been planning to run for a while, but she hasn't said anything publicly. On the GOP side, Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds will likely be governor soon after incumbent Terry Branstad is confirmed as ambassador to China. Cedar Rapids Mayor Ron Corbett has talked about challenging Reynolds in the primary, but he doesn't seem to be in much of a hurry to get in. Last month, Corbett promised a \"surprise\" at the end of his state of the city address, but instead of a gubernatorial announcement, that surprise was him singing a musical tribute to Cedar Rapids. Yes, really.\n\n MD-Gov: Yet another Democrat is considering taking on GOP Gov. Larry Hogan next year. Jim Shea, a wealthy and prominent Baltimore attorney, says he's formed an exploratory committee, and plans to decide by the summer. Shea tied Hogan to Trump, arguing that the governor hasn't stood up to him and \"real leadership\" is needed. Shea served as chair of the University of Maryland Board of Regents and the Baltimore Sun describes him as \"well known in legal and Democratic circles,\" though unknown to most of the public.\n\nMaryland is a very blue state, but Hogan has posted strong approval ratings during the first half of his term. However, a recent Abt-SRBI poll for the Washington Post and the University of Maryland raised some eyebrows and underscored the dangers Trump could pose to the governor. The survey gave Hogan a 65-17 approval rating, but found him leading a generic Democrat just 39-36. Of course, this is one poll against an unnamed Democrat, and a Goucher poll from last month found a very different result: Hogan posted a 63-17 approval, and led \"another candidate\" 57-33.\n\nHogan would be far from the first governor to lose in large part thanks to the president's unpopularity. Perhaps most infamously, Texas Democratic Gov. Ann Richards had strong approval ratings in 1994, but she still lost to future-painter George W. Bush 53-46. Maryland rarely elects Republicans statewide, and because so many residents work for the federal government, Trump's proposed and implemented cuts may have an even larger effect in the state than almost anywhere else, which could cause Hogan problems. A number of other Maryland Democrats are talking about getting in and challenging the popular incumbent, but no one has kicked off a campaign yet.\n\n NM-Gov, NM-Sen: Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham has had the Democratic gubernatorial primary to herself for months, but she finally drew an opponent this week. State Sen. Joe Cervantes, who is personally wealthy, tells Joe Monahan that he'll run to succeed termed-out GOP Gov. Susana Martinez. Monahan describes Cervantes, who hails from the Las Cruces area, as a moderate who will run to the right of Lujan Grisham. However, Monahan also says that former Univision Jeff Apodaca is \"expected\" to run soon, and the two will likely \"be vying for much of the same Dem vote.\" State Attorney General Hector Balderas is also flirting with a bid, and Monahan expects a decision \"sooner rather than later;\" businessman and 2014 candidate Alan Webber and Santa Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales are also considering.\n\nNew Mexico has become a reliably blue state in federal elections, but Martinez decisively won in 2010 and 2014. However, Martinez may end up being more of a liability than an asset for her party next year. A recent Public Policy Polling survey for the liberal group ProgressNowNM gave the governor a 42 percent approval rating, while 56 percent rated her as \"not so good\" or \"poor\". Back in October, SurveyUSA found Martinez underwater with a 36-49 approval rating, while a Research & Polling Inc. survey for the Albuquerque Journal gave her a meh 42-44.\n\nA few Republicans have talked about getting in. Lt. Gov. John Sanchez has expressed interest before, and he said this week that, he'll serve the state \"[w]hether it's as governor or a U.S. Senator or whatever role that I feel makes the biggest difference for New Mexico families.\" However, Sanchez said that he'd wait until the state's budget situation is resolved first. This is also the first time we've heard him talk about challenging Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, who doesn't appear to be particularly vulnerable. However, Sanchez's electoral history isn't very good. Sanchez ran for governor in 2002 and got crushed by Democrat Bill Richardson 55-39. Sanchez did become lieutenant governor in 2010 but he soon launched a Senate bid that went nowhere, and he dropped out long before the primary.\n\nOther potential GOP candidates have been quiet about their plans recently. Rep. Steve Pearce, who badly lost the 2008 Senate race, talked about running last November, but he's said little since then. Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry didn't rule out a bid in January, though he also didn't say no to a Senate run or to seeking Lujan Grisham's open House seat. Berry decisively won re-election in 2013 in Democratic-leaning Albuquerque, and he may be the best candidate the GOP could get.\n\n OH-Gov: A few days ago, WVXU wrote that Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley is \"expected to announce any day now\" that she will seek the Democratic nod. Whaley has yet to declare she's in publicly, but Politico reports that she's telling county party chairs that she's running.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-32: Democratic Rep. Grace Napolitano will be almost 82 on Election Day, and local Democrats are getting ready to run in case the incumbent doesn't. A little while ago, Mary Ann Lutz, a former Napolitano staffer and an ex-mayor of Monrovia, said she was preparing to run, but she made it clear she wouldn't challenge her old boss. El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero also recently filed to run for Congress, but he told Politico that his campaign also would only happen if Napolitano retires. Quintero says that \"the best information I have is that she's running for reelection.\" But as Politico points out, Quintero and Napolitano have the same consultant, so he may know more about her plans than he lets on. This Los Angeles-area seat backed Clinton 67-28.\n\n CA-50: On Thursday, the U.S. House Committee on Ethics announced they would defer an investigation of GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter for allegedly using campaign money for his own uses because the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation.\n\nHunter, who represents a heavily Republican seat in the San Diego suburbs, has attracted a string of bad headlines over the last year as he's been questioned over where his campaign money has gone. In April, the FEC noted that Hunter's campaign paid for video games from the site Steam 68 separate times, racking up a total bill of $1,302. The congressman's office argued that his son had used his credit card for one game and that additional charges resulted when Hunter tried to cancel purchases. But over the next several months, the public learned that the Hunter campaign had reimbursed $62,000 in expenses for other charges, including tuition to his children's private school, oral surgery, a hotel in Italy, and $600 to fly one of the congressman's children's pet rabbit on a plane.\n\nEven with all of Hunter's problems, his seat is likely to stay red without much trouble regardless of what happens to him. While Democrats have made gains in the San Diego area, this district backed Trump 55-40. Hunter has represented this area since 2009, and his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., served in the House from 1981 until he retired to wage a forgettable presidential bid in 2008. Voters may be inclined to give the Hunter family the benefit of the doubt but if things get worse for the congressman legally, Congress may be Duncan Hunter-free for the first time since the Carter administration.\n\n FL-07: National Republicans were working hard to convince state Rep. Bob Cortes to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy, but he announced on Thursday that he would stay in the state House. Murphy unseated longtime Republican Rep. John Mica, who ran an almost non-existent campaign, 51.5-48.5 as Clinton was carrying this suburban Orlando seat 51-44. Republicans will likely target Murphy, but it's unclear who they'll field. State Sen. David Simmons has talked about running here, but he also expressed interest in doing other things.\n\n GA-06: Wealthy GOP ex-state Sen. Dan Moody is out with his second TV spot, where the narrator credits \"Dan Moody and his fellow Republicans\" for saving Georgia's economy during the Great Recession. The narrator also says that then-Gov. Sonny Perdue named Moody \"legislator of the year.\"\n\n MI-01: Retired Marine Lt. Col. Matt Morgan, whom Politico says \"worked in two presidential administrations and the office of the secretary of defense,\" recently expressed interest in challenging GOP freshman Rep. Jack Bergman, a retired Marine lieutenant general. Morgan has filed with the FEC, and while he says he's still considering whether to run, he adds, \"I'm a Marine. Once I get something in my teeth it's hard to get it out.\" This seat, which includes the Upper Peninsula, swung from 54-45 Romney to 58-37 Trump, and while outside groups spent heavily here last year, Bergman won 55-40.\n\n MN-07: Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson consistently flirts with retiring, and he hasn't committed to seeking another term in 2018. However, while Peterson tells the National Journal that while he hasn't decided what to do next year, he's \"actually having funso, might hang around.\" Peterson's rural seat went from a tough 54-44 Romney to a brutal 62-31 Trump and Team Blue would have an incredibly difficult time holding it without him, something Peterson acknowledges.\n\n NV-04: Last cycle, Democrat Ruben Kihuen unseated freshman Republican Cresent Hardy 49-45, about the same as Clinton's 49-45 margin in this suburban Las Vegas seat. Hardy didn't rule out a rematch last December, though he doesn't appear to have said anything publicly since then. GOP state Sen. Scott Hammond is expressing interest in running, and he tells Politico that he's \"putting together a committee\" to see if a bid is possible. However, Hammond sounds unlikely to run if Hardy does, saying that he's \"also waiting to hear back from Cresent on this.\" Kihuen has left the door open to running for statewide office next year, though there's no indication he's planning to leave the House so soon.\n\n SC-05: State House Speaker Pro Temp Tommy Pope has launched the first TV ad of the crowded special election for this reliably red Rock Hill-area seat. Pope stands in the woods and tells the audience that \"a lot's changed since I was a police officer.\" A small flat screen TV (which Pope has situated against a tree like any normal person would) flashes scary images of what Pope characterizes as \"rampant illegal immigration, terrorism at home, [and] violence against the police.\" Pope then touts his time as an officer and prosecutor and pledges to toughen up America. There is no word on the size of the buy. The GOP primary will be May 2, and there will be a May 16 runoff in the likely event no one takes a majority.\n\nGrab Bag\n\n Census: The Census Bureau has released its annual Population Estimate numbers for the period spanning July 2015-June 2016, and unsurprisingly, it shows continued stagnation or decline in northeastern and Midwestern cities, paired with growth in the west and south. Maricopa County, Arizona (the home of Phoenix) is the biggest gainer during that period, with a numeric gain of 81,360. Several slightly-less-populous counties gained at faster rates, percentage-wise, including Clark County, Nevada (Las Vegas; 2.20 percent growth), and Orange County, Florida (Orlando; 2.30).\n\nThere were even higher growth rates in smaller-population counties; the leader last year, surprisingly, was San Juan County, Utah (a county in the state's southeast corner with a majority Native American population), growing 7.56 percent. Other big gainers were Hays and Comal Counties, Texas, in the corridor between San Antonio and Austin, and Sumter County, Florida, where the mega-retirement community of the Villages is located. (The Villages MSA was also the fastest-growing metropolitan area, if you switch to MSAs from counties.)\n\nThe biggest numeric decline was Cook County, Illinois (where Chicago is; with a loss of 21,324), followed by Wayne County, Michigan (Detroit) and Baltimore City, Maryland. One other noteworthy trend is that the rapid growth in North Dakota's oil patch has totally flattened out in the last year; after having the largest population gains, percentage-wise, of anywhere in the U.S. for several years, those counties are now losing overall population.\n\nDemographer Jed Kolko also did some excellent slice-and-dice of the new numbers based on density, and what he found mirrors other recent findings that after a brief acceleration during the early 2010s, big-city growth is tapering off in favor of a return to more suburbanization, with particular growth in the \"large-metro lower-density suburbs,\" which most people tend to call the \"exurbs.\" That has probably to do with both historically low gas prices, which make longer commutes more feasible again, as well as disproportionately-skyrocketing real estate prices within the boundaries of most major cities.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/24/1646584/-Morning-Digest-Ken-Salazar-won-t-run-for-governor-of-Colorado-but-Ed-Perlmutter-reportedly-will#read-more", "date": "2017/3/24"}, {"text": "Well, the House Republicans flubbed their big plans for the health care bomb vote.

KITM has a lot to catch up on, so listen up: Paul Manafort continues to be connected to various Eastern European countries, and more surprisingly, continues breathing. Hes now hiding in Trump Tower, because patsies know the benefits of windows that dont open. Manaforts daughter passes blackmail notes, sympathy, condolences, and other PR on to Pops. Paul could hide elsewhere, but that would mean stepping onto the sidewalk. Greg Dworkin is back! And hes gathered a potpourri of corruption, incompetence, and regret, featuring a pungent whiff of treason. More and more Americans are convinced Donald Trump has what it takes to be a supervillain. The Trump Troubadour is now singing a different tune. Donald didnt like a Hawaii lawmaker, so she became a Democrat. After weeks, not months or years of gestation, Trumpcare goes for a vote. Its coming up short on votes, because no one is sure what they are voting for. Republicans do agree on the goal of doing less for more people, because insurance is definitely cheaper when nothing is insured. Why deductibles would rise under the GOP health care plan. If destruction is the destination, Trumpcare is already there. David tackles the details of what is coming up in voting and strategy. Some Democrats rush to surrender to Trump while he is still around to lose to. Chuck Schumer joins the filibuster of Neil Gorsuch. While Gorsuch was testifying, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed he was wrong. Devin Nunes is finally having his name pronounced correctly, although his orange jumpsuit will only have a number. Trump will be tweeting about that guy in London, but not this guy in Manhattan, who was a dapper fellow.

Republicans chose an expedited procedural route to replace Obamacare in order to avoid a filibuster by Senate Democrats, which would require 60 votes to end. But that route restricts them to making changes affecting how much the government spends or collects in taxes. So if they want to change, for example, insurance regulations, that may not be allowed. Who determines what can be in the bill? Once the House sends a bill to the Senate, the Senate Budget Committee would consult with the Senate parliamentarian to come up with a list of provisions that might violate the rules.\n\nAmber Philips at The Fix breaks down the new CBO score on the revised bill:\n\nBasically the only difference this new bill will have on the federal government is how much it will cost: Instead of reducing the deficit by an estimated $337 billion over the next decade like the first version did, it will reduce it by about $150 billion. This CBO score is one of the reasons Republicans' last-minute delay on a planned Thursday vote on the bill is so damaging for their already slim chances of getting something passed: It gives every side opposed to this bill  and there are many  more time to digest what they hate most about it.\n\nSam Petulla at NBC has a great chart on Republicans who oppose or lean against the bill and Trump support in their district:\n\nAs of this moment, NBC News counts that at least 32 House representatives are against or leaning against the bill.\n\nRussell Berman at The Atlantic:\n\nRepublicans were clearly short of votes heading into Thursday nights meeting. The only question was by how many. Party leaders had postponed a vote they had long planned to hold on the Obamacare anniversary, unable to win over conservatives without losing too many moderate members who feared the bills impact on insurance coverage, Medicaid, and premium rates. Trumps ultimatum may have come too late: About a dozen Republicans representing swing districts or Democratic states had already publicly announced their opposition and will have a hard time flipping based on so baldly political an appeal.\n\nAdam Davidson at The New Yorker:\n\nSometimes the debates about health care in Washington can seem absurd, as if politicians have the ability to engineer our health economy with precision. The truth is that, no matter what insurance schemes are designed by Congress, we cannot avoid sharing the costs and benefits of health care. If we deny someone care today, we will be paying that cost later, in the form of more expensive treatment or lost years of productive employment. (This is most abundantly true with prenatal treatment and the care of young children, in which relatively modest expenditures today can pay off dividends for a lifetime.) If we make health care less available, we will all live in a poorer nation. Certainly, plenty of health-care dollars are wasted, and there are sensible changes to the system that would improve the cost-effectiveness of care. But, as a rule, abundant access to decent, essential health care is an investment with some of the greatest returns.\n\nWhich brings us to Ryan Coopers piece at The Week on why Democrats should push Medicare for all now:\n\nObamaCare did not finish the job of achieving universal health care, and this is a good chance to move the ball forward. The AHCA is extraordinarily unpopular because it takes coverage and subsidies away from people, and a majority believe that it should be the government's responsibility to make sure everyone is covered. Fundamentally, Medicare is very popular, a fact only partially covered up by generations of red-baiting and duplicitous austerian propaganda. If Democrats had simply bulled ahead with a single payer-esque plan in 2009, instead of the complicated and heavily means-tested ObamaCare, they almost certainly would have done better than they actually did in the 2010 election. And even for people who are skeptical of going full-bore all at once on single-payer, it still makes an excellent opening bid. Start with single-payer for all during the next bite at the health-care apple, and you could end up with a plan of combining Medicare and Medicaid, enrolling all people under 26 and over 55, and putting a Medicare buy-in on the ObamaCare exchanges. (That might begin chipping away at the employer-based system and be a somewhat more gradual route to single-payer.) Just witness the original opening bid for ObamaCare, which was far more generous before it got badly whittled down by conservative Democrats.\n\nOn a final note, Jennifer Epstein at Bloomberg explains how Democrats plan to weaponize the bill against House Republicans:", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/24/1646756/-Abbreviated-pundit-roundup-Republican-chaos-puts-Trumpcare-in-jeopardy#read-more", "date": "2017/3/24"}, {"text": "The consequences of these budget cuts would be vast, IPS fellow and U.S. policy director at Oil Change International Janet Redman told the Marc Steiner Show, regarding Trumps proposed budget cuts to federal environmental programs.\n\nTrumps assault on the climate doesnt stop with his proposed cuts to the EPA. It also seeks to cut 28 percent of the State Department budget, which is how the U.S. relates internationally to climate change and energy policy,\n\nIPS Climate Policy director Basav Sen said racism and white supremacy and crony capitalism are the underlying sources of the White Houses climate policy.\n\nPeople of color and poor people have paid a disproportionate price for the polluting ways of corporate America, Sen explained. This led to the creation of environmental justice programs at the EPA which have provided support and data to these communities.\n\nBy trying to get rid of these programs and moving forward with other bad environmental policies like with the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the administrations message is that they dont care about the environment, the future of humanity, or people of color, Sen argued.\n\nSen went on to discuss the effects of large fossil fuel companies that have a lot of clout with the current administration. The issue is not about being pro-business, Sen said, its about crony capitalism. [...]\n\nThe budget cuts also target clean energy research and take away funding for climate action initiatives at the state level. Services that help people are being shifted to state agencies instead of operated on the federal level, which means less enforcement and implementation of provisions such as the Clean Air Act and Water Act, which targets already vulnerable communities, Redman argued.\n\nIf the federal government not only refuses to act, but intends on taking America backwards, theres a lot that cities and states can do and have done, Sen said. Hawaii will be 100 percent renewal energy for their electricity by 2045, Oregon will completely eliminate coal from their electricity supply by 2030, and Washington, D.C. will be 50 percent renewable for electricity by 2032 and simultaneously solarize 100,000 low income homes by then.\n\nListen to the full interview on The Marc Steiner Show", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/23/1646453/-Open-thread-for-night-owls-As-feds-retreat-on-climate-expect-states-to-pick-up-slack#view-story", "date": "2017/3/23"}, {"text": "Paul Ryan models the \"casual sociopath\" look.\n\nThe current version of Trumpcarethe one negotiated last week by popular vote loser Donald Trump with conservatives to woo votes for passagehasn't yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, even though it's slated for a vote Thursday. The thing is, though, nothing in those changes is likely to make the bottom line any better for people who are going to lost health insurance under Trumpcare. Any changes made to try to make tax credits better will be offset by the sped-up cuts to Medicaid, says the Brookings Institute.\n\nWe conclude that the changes made by the managers amendment will not meaningfully alter CBOs earlier prediction that the AHCA would substantially reduce insurance coverage. While one provision of the managers amendment would slightly relax the per capita cap on state Medicaid spending created under the AHCA and thereby modestly increase CBOs estimate of insurance coverage under the AHCA, the work requirement and block grant options created by the managers amendment have the potential to cause additional coverage losses that largely or more than offset this improvement, at least if states take up these options. The change to the medical expense deduction in the managers amendment is likely to have a negligible effect on CBOs coverage estimates. Some reports have suggested that this provision was inserted as a placeholder and that the intent of Republican leaders is for the Senate to remove this provision and use the savingsroughly $75 billion over ten yearsto increase individual market tax credits for older enrollees in some unspecified way. Naturally, unspecified future changes will not be incorporated in CBOs analysis of the current version of the legislation. However, given the relatively limited amount of money involved, we conclude that future changes along these lines would be likely to only marginally increase CBOs estimate of the level of insurance coverage under the AHCA.\n\nSo, yeah, 4 million people could lose insurance this year, 14 million next year, 24 million in a decade. Still. That doesn't even really get to the awfulness of those cuts: the destruction of Medicaid. In fact, this whole exercise could be nothing more than the fulfillment of sociopath Paul Ryan's frat-boy \"dream\" of cutting Medicaid. And with it the health and the lives of millions.\n\nx Disgusting. @PRyan says he's been \"dreaming\" of capping health insurance funds for low-income Americans since he was drinking out of kegs. pic.twitter.com/Kmu2f661Yf  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) March 17, 2017\n\nThe House is scheduled to vote on Trumpcare on THURSDAY, MARCH 23.

Last year, Texas lawmakers tried to force women who have miscarriages and abortions to bury their fetal tissue.

It is unacceptable that doctors can be penalized for embracing the sanctity of life, Senator Brandon Creighton (R-TX) said in a press release when he introduced the legislation last fall.\n\nTalk about an incredible and gross infringement of privacy!

In the past six years, the Mercers have poured tens of millions into Republican super PACs, Washington think tanks, state policy shops, a film-production company, a data analytics operation and one of the countrys most provocative online conservative news outlets. This year, Rebekah Mercer has emerged as a heavyweight presidential player, leading a super PAC financed by her father that was the biggest outside benefactor of Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) during the Republican primaries. After Donald Trump clinched the nomination, the Mercers rallied to his side. Their imprint is now evident on the real estate developers campaign, which is led by three close associates who ran Mercer-funded enterprises: former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen Bannon, pollster Kellyanne Conway and Citizens United President David Bossie. Meanwhile, Rebekah Mercer has taken up the day-to-day management of her familys super PAC, which is producing a string of searing ads attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nA lot of wealthy dots are being connected as this investigation rolls on and oh the wicked, treasonous web they weaved.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/23/1646393/-GWB-White-House-lawyer-FBI-uncovering-evidence-of-treason-There-is-no-other-word-for-it#read-more", "date": "2017/3/23"}, {"text": "While we're debating the future of medical care in this nation, to wit whether anybody should get any or whether we should just cut to the part where three quarters of us exist primarily as spare parts factories for the one percent, here's Team Trump's just-appointed assistant secretary for health technology at DHS, a big-deal title that sounds like it should be staffed by someone with at least a minimal degree of competence, talking in his 2006 book about how having tattoos is a sign of drug addiction.\n\n[O]bviously, not all who have a tattoo are addicts.

So, just as leaders in both parties had tried to do since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, we took up the cause of health reform. It was a long battle, carried out in Congressional hearings and in the public square for more than a year. But ultimately, after a century of talk, decades of trying, and a year of bipartisan debate, our generation was the one that succeeded. We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody.\n\nThe result was the Affordable Care Act, which I signed into law seven years ago today. Thanks to this law, more than twenty million Americans have gained the security and peace of mind of health insurance. Thanks to this law, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured  the highest rate in our history. Thanks to this law, the days when women could be charged more than men and Americans with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage altogether are relics of the past. Seniors have bigger discounts on their prescription drugs. Young people can stay on their parents plans until they turn 26 years old. And Americans who already had insurance received an upgrade as well  from free preventive care, like mammograms and vaccines, to improvements in the quality of care in hospitals that has averted nearly 100,000 deaths so far.\n\nAll of that is thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And all the while, since the law passed, the pace of health care inflation has slowed dramatically. Prices are still rising, just as they have every year for decades  but under this law, theyve been rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a death spiral, because while it's true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable. Likewise, this law is no job-killer, because Americas businesses went on a record-breaking streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it.\n\nSo the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act. There will always be work to do to reduce costs, stabilize markets, improve quality, and help the millions of Americans who remain uninsured in states that have so far refused to expand Medicaid. Ive always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if theyre prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals  thats something we all should welcome. But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is law only because millions of Americans mobilized, and organized, and decided that this fight was about more than health care  it was about the character of our country. It was about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth would make sure that neither illness nor twist of fate would rob us of everything weve worked so hard to build. It was about whether we look out for one another, as neighbors, and fellow citizens, who care about each others success. This fight is still about all that today. And Americans who love their country still have the power to change it.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/23/1646424/-Obama-America-is-stronger-because-of-the-Affordable-Care-Act#read-more", "date": "2017/3/23"}, {"text": "While popular vote loser Donald Trump continues his wooing of the Freedom Caucus maniacs to make Trumpcare happen, the not-so-conservative Republicans are jumping ship.\n\nx Our updated whip count: THERE ARE NOW ENOUGH MODERATES ON RECORD TO DEFEAT THE BILL.

The problem is that, as of now, they don't know what's going to be in Trumpcare. Popular vote loser Donald Trump is meeting with the Freedom Caucus late Thursday morning to nail down votes by trading off everything that makes health insurance actually insurance that helps you if you get sick.\n\nRepublicans are, literally, trying to impose what's called \"martial law.\" They're trying to override the rule that legislation has to have at least one day between introduction and a vote on the floor, so that whenever they get the agreement between the Freedom Caucus and Trump inked legislative language it can go straight to the floor. That means that there will be no score from the Congressional Budget Office. There will be no hearings. There will be no mark-ups. And what they are talking about doing could have truly radical consequences. Here's a little speculation what it would allow from health insurance wonk David Anderson:\n\nThe first stream of product design will be aimed to cover very little. The primary objective of these plans are to be priced at the subsidy point. They will be very narrow networks with no major academic medical centers involved; their benefits will be designed to drive away sick people with chronic conditions. For instance, asthma inhalers or insulin or Epi-Pens might not be covered. Hep-C drugs would not be covered. Maternity care would not be covered except after a $15,000 stand-alone deductible. They will use donut benefit designed principles where the first couple of PCP visits are no cost sharing but everything else comes with $300 co-pays and $20,000 deductibles. Utilization is designed to be very low and the population that will choose these policies will have to be very healthy. The selling point for this plan is that it is free out of pocket after the subsidy AND it is sufficient to not incur the continuous coverage 30% premium penalty.\n\nAnd on top of that, we get the really horrible stuff that was in the original billparticularly the $880 billion it strips from Medicaid. Stripping essential health benefits away on top of those Medicaid cuts is just driving what we have to call moderate Republicans away. So the votes they secure with the Freedom Caucus could be matched by votes lost with people who aren't quite as unconcerned with human life.\n\nHelp the fight.

So between now and Monday, March 27, anything House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to force onto the floor can be. Why? Because Ryan wants to kill Medicaid now so he can have tax cuts later.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has made a key Republican motive for pushing ahead with the House GOP health plan explicit in recent interviews: passing the health package first facilitates deeper tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations in subsequent tax legislation. Thats because the House GOP health plan reduces revenues by nearly $900 billion over the decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), including $592 billion in tax cuts largely for the wealthy. Passing these tax cuts now as part of a health package allows the GOP to offset their cost through cuts to health care spendingparticularly in Medicaid, which CBO estimates the House health care bill cuts by $880 billion over ten years. If these tax cuts were part of tax reform legislation rather than being in the health bill, Republican leaders would have to offset their cost on the tax side to maintain revenue neutrality, as they have said they would do, limiting how sharply they can cut tax rates. Instead, because these tax cuts are in the health bill, Republicans can, in writing their tax bill later this year, make much deeper cuts in tax rates  particularly for corporations  than they otherwise could do.\n\nRyan freely admits it: \"And so yes, it is important that we get this [the health plan] done so that we can do tax reform. Because this bill also takes out about $900 billion in tax increases, the Obamacare tax increases are taken out which makes it $900 billion easier to reform the tax code afterwards.\" And he's got popular vote loser Donald Trump snowed into believing that this is somehow how legislating happens. That there are laws that mean it has to work this way.\n\nWhen he talked about tax reform late last month, in the infamous \"Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,\" statement, he said: I cant do it [tax reform] until we do health care, because we have to know what the health care is going to cost andstatutorilythats the way it is. So for those people who say, oh, gee, I wish we could do the tax first, it just doesnt work that way. I would like to do the tax first. There's not statute. It's strategy and it's politics.

This seat, which is located east of Seattle, went from 58-40 Obama all the way to 65-28 Clinton, making it the bluest GOP-held seat in either chamber.\n\nRepublican Dino Rossi, who ran for governor in 2004 and 2008 and the U.S. Senate in 2010, was appointed to replace Hill, but Rossi says he's not interested in running in the special. Democrats have consolidated behind prosecutor Manka Dhingra, while it's unclear whom the GOP will field. If Democrats can flip this seat, they'll have control of the Senate for the first time since Sheldon and now-former state Sen. Rodney Tom launched their coup in late 2012.\n\nLD-45 will be up again in the fall of 2018, and Democrats have a few other GOP-held Senate seats they can target next year. LD-30, held by Republican Mark Miloscia (a former Democratic state representative) went from 59-39 Obama to 57-36 Clinton. LD-47, represented by Republican Joe Fain, went from 56-42 Obama to 54-38 Clinton. Both Miloscia and Fain decisively won during the 2014 GOP wave but if next year is good for Democrats, they could be in for a tougher fight. The GOP-held LD-26 and LD-42 both narrowly backed Clinton (she carried the latter seat by just 10 votes), but they'll be tough targets.\n\nDemocrats could also try exacting revenge on Sheldon next year, but their best bet may be to deny him a place in the general election rather than try beating him in November. Indeed, this almost happened in 2014, when Democrat Irene Bowling took first in the top-two primary with 35 percent while Sheldon edged Republican Travis Couture by just 600 votes for the second-place spot. However, Sheldon ended up beating Bowling 54-46 a few months later.\n\nWe'll turn next to the state House. In the 2014 GOP wave, Republicans chipped the Democratic majority down from 55-43 to just 51-47; in the fall of 2015, the GOP picked up a Democratic seat in a special election. Democrats hoped that the presidential race would allow them to expand their majority, but their narrow 50-48 majority didn't move.\n\nJust like in the state Senate, ticket-splitting overwhelmingly helps the GOP. Eleven Republican represent Clinton seats, while state Rep. Brian Blake is the one Democrat to hail from a Trump district. Blake represents the same aforementioned LD-19 that sends Dean Takko to the state Senate. After Blake, the House Democrats in the reddest seat are Mike Chapman and Steve Tharinger, whose LD-24 went from 54-43 Obama to 49-43 Clinton.\n\nTeam Blue will get the chance to play offensive next year. The bluest GOP-held seat is LD-05, which elects Republican state Reps. Jay Rodne and Paul Graves to the lower house, even though it has a Democratic state senator. This seat, located east of Seattle, went from 53-44 Obama to 55-37 Clinton, but Rodne won a seventh term 52-48 while Graves won his first term 54-46. Three other Republicans hold seats where Clinton's margin of victory was over 10 percent, while those remaining six Republicans hold districts where her margin was no greater than 3.2 percent.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n AL-Gov: Next year's open-seat GOP primary has not been easy to follow. To begin with, it's not clear that this will be an open seat. GOP Gov. Robert Bentley is under investigation for allegedly using state resources to conceal an affair with a staffer. If the state House votes to impeach him, Bentley's powers will pass to GOP Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey unless the state Senate acquits him; if the state Senate votes to convict Bentley, Ivey will officially become governor. It also doesn't help that, while several Alabama Republicans have made noises about running for governor, many of the biggest names in state politics have been publicly silent. Political columnist Steve Flowers provides some new details about what some of the potential GOP candidates are up to, but we may be waiting a while for this contest to take shape.\n\nOne of the names we've occasionally heard mentioned is Public Service Commission President Twinkle Cavanaugh. However, Flowers says that Cavanaugh is \"already out running for governor,\" though Cavanaugh has yet to announce anything publicly and her social media pages don't identify her as a candidate. Flowers also says that state Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan, a longtime politician who was first elected to the legislature in 1974 as a Democrat, is planning to get in. Flowers adds that Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle is \"seriously considering,\" but that while Secretary of State John Merrill is being encouraged, Flowers doubts he'll go for it. State Treasurer Young Boozer (who won in 2010 with the tagline \"Funny name, serious leadership\") is keeping his 2018 plans very quiet.\n\nBut wait there's more! Roy Moore, the twice-disgraced former chief justice of the state supreme court, has been publicly flirting with a third run for governor, but he's also talked about challenging appointed GOP Sen. Luther Strange or running for attorney general. Moore was suspended from office last year for defying federal court orders on same-sex marriage; In 2003, Moore was outright removed from the bench for refusing to comply with a federal judge's order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the grounds of the state supreme court. But while Moore's 2006 primary challenge to incumbent Bob Riley badly failed and he took a distant fourth in 2010, Flowers writes that unreleased polls show that Moore is popular in this very conservative state.\n\nState Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh is also talking about running for either the Senate or for governor, but he likely starts with little name recognition. But Flowers says that Marsh reportedly is wealthy, and he's \"itching to pull the trigger on the governor's race.\"\n\nWe've also heard from plenty of other Republicans, though some seem more serious than others. State Auditor Jim Zeigler, a longtime Bentley critic, is talking about running, and he even recently self-published a novel about a candidate who \"stood up in the Bentley years and, in 2018, stood out from the rest.\" We've also heard interest from Jefferson County Commissioner David Carrington; Troy University Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr.; and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, while Rep. Rep. Bradley Byrne hasn't said no. One person who has been quiet is Ivey, who may end up becoming governor without being elected to the post.\n\n NJ-Gov: On Tuesday, Democratic state Assemblyman John Wisniewski announced that he had raised the $450,000 he needed to qualify for state public matching funds in the June primary. Under this system, candidates receive $2 for every $1 they raise, though they're not allowed to spend more than $6.4 million in the primary. Clinton-era U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury Jim Johnson has already qualified, while state Sen. Ray Lesniak recently said he doubts he'll raise enough. Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany who is backed by the state's powerful Democratic establishment, is personally wealthy and can spend whatever he needs to spend.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-49: Last cycle, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa pulled off a 1,621-vote victory over Marine veteran Doug Applegate in a contest that looked completely uncompetitive for most of the cycle. Applegate quickly announced he would seek a rematch, but this time, he'll have some intra-party competition. Environmental attorney Mike Levin, who served as executive director of the Orange County Democratic Party a decade ago, kicked off his bid earlier this month, but Applegate is arguing that he has the inside track to face Issa again. Applegate is out with a Strategies 360 poll of the June 2018 top two primary that gives Issa a 43-39 lead, while Levin takes third with just 9. In California, the two candidates with the most votes in the June primary advance to the general regardless of party.\n\nLevin unsurprisingly starts out almost completely unknown, while Democratic voters have a good opinion of Applegate after he almost beat the hated Issa. This seat, which includes both the San Diego media market and the very expensive Los Angeles market, is not cheap to advertise in at all. Things could very well change if Levin can raise or self-fund enough to get his name out, but it's too early to know Levin's capabilities. This suburban San Diego seat swung from 52-46 Romney to 51-43 Clinton, and both parties are likely to get involved here far earlier this time.\n\n MN-03: Last cycle, this suburban Minneapolis seat swung from 50-49 Obama to 51-41 Clinton, but Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen decisively beat highly-touted Democratic state Sen. Terri Bonoff 57-43. Paulsen is a very strong fundraiser and a formidable campaigner, but if Trump damages the GOP brand across the country, he could be vulnerable. No one has publicly expressed interest in challenging Paulsen, though the Minneapolis Star-Tribune says that Dean Phillips, a businessman and philanthropist who is the heir to the Phillips Distilling Company fortune, may be interested. According to state Rep. Jon Applebaum, \"a lot of national and local people are asking him to run and that he is strongly considering it.\" The paper says that Phillips, who is also the grandson of the original Dear Abby, can self-fund.\n\nLegislative\n\n Special Elections: On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Democrats competed for HD-197, a Philadelphia seat that gave Obama 97 percent of the vote but there was no Democrat on the ballot. As Johnny Longtorso recently explained, the Democrats originally nominated Freddie Ramirez, who was struck from the ballot when it was determined that he didn't live in the district. After the courts ruled that it was too late for Democrat Emilio Vasquez to make the ballot, Team Blue mounted a write-in campaign for him. So, how did it go? Johnny Longtorso checks in:\n\nPennsylvania HD-197: And the winner is... someone who's not the Republican. Write-ins accounted for 93 percent of the votes cast in this special election, while Republican Lucinda Little, the only candidate on the ballot, received 7 percent. We will know who won on Friday when write-ins are counted; Democrat Emilio Vasquez seems the most likely victor.\n\nDemocrats handed out stamps spelling \"Emilio Vazquez\" outside of polling places, while the Green Party did the same thing for their write-in candidate, Cheri Honkala. Another Democrat, Edward Loyd, also launched a write-in campaign, but he didn't have any organizational muscle behind him.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/23/1646208/-Morning-Digest-Washington-Democrats-might-retake-the-state-Senate-as-soon-as-this-November#read-more", "date": "2017/3/23"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Thursday, March 23, 2017\n\nNote: \"You got your wire tapp in my chocolate!\" \"Well you got your wire tapp in my peanut butter!\" [Nuclear buttons are pushed, world ends, humanity discovers Heaven has a decent salad bar.

Which brings us to energy policy---remember his secret task force? In the long history of monumentally bad ideas, the Cheney policy is a standout for reasons of both omission and commission. Dumb, dumber and dumbest. Ponder this: Next year, the administration will phase out the $2,000 tax credit for buying a hybrid vehicle, which gets over 50 miles per gallon, but will leave in place the $25,000 tax write-off for a Hummer, which gets 10-12 mpg. That's truly crazy, and that's truly what the whole Cheney energy policy is. ---March 2005\n\n-\n\nPuppy Pic of the Day: Happy happy happy\n\n-\n\nCHEERS to signin' significant stuff. Seven years ago today, one letter at a time, President Barack Obama signed his name to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, making it the law of the land and fulfilling a promise he coincidentally made ten years ago this week:\n\n[W]e recognize that every four years we hear somebodys got a health care plan. Done. Every four years, somebody trots out a white paper---they post it on the web. But the question we have to challenge ourselves: Do we have the political will and the sense of urgency to actually get it done? I want to be held accountable for getting it done. I will judge my first term as president based on the fact on whether we have delivered the kind of health care that every American deserves and that our system can afford.\n\nThat poor law's been so battered and bruised over the last seven years that ya hope to god it has an Obamacare gold plan sealed in a titanium shell. But, by god, it's working (the number of Americans without insurance has dropped to a record-low 8.8 percent, for one thing) and could be a model for the rest of the world with some minor fixes. (Okay, as pointed out in the comments, major fixes would be required to accomplish that. Point taken. --BiPM) But fixing things isnt part of the Republican skill set, so tonight they'll try and complete their seven year vow to repeal it root and branch, and toss in the destruction of Medicaid as an added bonus.\n\nSpeaking selfishly, the timing couldn't be worse. This is my third year as a contented ACA enrollee on the federal exchange, and the Trump-Ryan-McConnell axis of evil is tossing their grenade one week after emergency surgery and a cancer diagnosis. (Gee, thanks, guys.) If there's a deity up there somewhere, the bill will suffer the same fate in the House today as Icarus's little tango with the sun. There's certainly a shitload of opposition, including my surgeon who said without missing a beat when I mentioned Trump Care during my Tuesday follow-up appointment: \"Now there's an oxymoron.\" Yup.

Exactly as we knew they eventually would, some terror-minded jackass staged an attack yesterday---this time in London, killing three and injuring thirty. And we pull the checklist out of the drawer:\n\n1. Tend to the victims, assess the situation. 2. Worldwide condemnation for those responsible, universal support and love for the afflicted country. 3. Clean up, rebuild, track down any accomplices, grieve for the victims. 4. Refuse to be terrorized, get on with life. 5. The terrorists lose.\n\nIt's a good list to keep handy. We will certainly need it again.\n\nCHEERS to Sergeant Rubberbutt. On March 23, 1944, RAF Sgt. Nickolas Alkemade survived a jump from his Lancaster bomber from 18,000 feet without a parachute. Other than some cuts and a twisted knee, he was fine. The Nazi he landed on...not so fine.\n\nCHEERS to bragging rights. The numbers are finally in from the 2016 election, andokay, okay, Minnesota came out on top in voter turnout with an impressive 75 percent. Congratulations. But Maine was nippin' at the Gopher State's heels:\n\nMaine had the second-highest voter turnout in the country for last years presidential election. True fact: this Republican index finger was arrested last November for trying to vote a second time as a registered thumb. A new report says 72.8 percent of Maines voting-eligible population cast ballots in the 2016 election.  The nonprofit VOTE and the US Election Project compiled the numbers. Maine ranked sixth in the nation in the 2012 election. Maine adopted same-day voter registration in 1974, an option offered by many of the other states with high turnout.\n\nKudos also to Colorado, Virginia and New Hampshire for making it into the 70+ club. (You can see how your state ranked here.) Some say that Mainers flooded the voting booths because in addition to the presidential ticket we had some provocative ballot questions, including marijuana legalization, a minimum wage hike, and ranked-choice voting that will prevent Paul LePage-type nutcases from becoming governor again with only 38 percent of the vote. Perhaps so. But I prefer to believe it was the irrepressible sense of civic duty that bubbles like a cauldron of patriotic clam chowder in the lobster shack of our collective souls. Sounds better.\n\n-\n\nTen years ago in C&J: March 23, 2007\n\nCHEERS to the Maines event.

But after seeing the group's artistry and courage taking on the country music industry in the movie Shut Up and Sing over the weekend, I downloaded Not Ready to Make Nice and some other tunes. Love em. For the record, I'm not ashamed George Bush is from Texas. From America, yes.\n\n-\n\nAnd just one more\n\nCHEERS to a silver-glitter lining in our unfolding national nightmare. Trump will, of course, claim these are fake numbers.

As you well know, Trump Tower is a wretched hive of scum and villainy. The FBI would be remiss in its duties had it not been watching it for years. By the way, Paul Manafort is one of Melanias neighbors too, even if Sean Spicer lives far, far away. Trump Tower does seem to be a franchise, with the Russian elite investing nearly $100 million in Trump buildings in Southern Florida alone.

And its proof more than ever that even if we get that prosecutor and inquiry, a free and independent press may be the only real way to ever get to the bottom of what ranking committee member Adam Schiff said may represent one of the most shocking betrayals of our democracy in history. [...] And yet, as presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told The Washington Post, Theres a smell of treason in the air. Imagine if J.

But here we are, adrift in a Cloud Cuckoo Land of prevarication and incompetence in which little seems capable of boggling or driving our minds agog these days and where the truth shall not set you free but subject you to ridicule from the rabid trolls of the right.\n\nCharles M. Blow at The New York Times writesBirth of the biggest lie:\n\nIndividuals who were associated with the president of the United States winning campaign are under criminal investigation. That is an extraordinary sentence and one that no American can allow to be swallowed up by other news or dismissed by ideologues. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, we could be facing a constitutional crisis. Oddly, it is likely that the reason Trump is even in the Oval Office is Comeys original, extraordinarily inappropriate and unprecedented action. The Trump machinery then used that action to scare Americans about Clinton, in one of the most astonishing acts of deflection and hypocrisy in American history. [...] The lie these people promoted about Clinton and shielded about Trump are two of the biggest lies ever told in this country in service of electoral advantage. No act of this presidency  good or bad, beneficial or detrimental  can ever be considered without first contextualizing that this presidency itself was conceived in deception and is being incubated under an extraordinary lie. The Trump presidency is a corruption that flows from corruption. It is damned by its own damned lies.\n\nMartin Longman at The Washington Monthly writesDevin Nunes Intends to Obstruct Justice:\n\nWhen Nunes arrives at the White House and begins sharing information about which Transition officials were captured on incidental surveillance, he will be committing what appears to be an obvious crime. He claims that the surveillance is unrelated to Russia, and that may be his only criminal defense. He better hope that it will stand up in court. His press conference performance was a dishonest attempt to suggest that perhaps Trump wasnt completely wrong when he said that Trump Tower was wiretapped at the behest of President Obama. He couldnt assert either of those things but he made it seem like he had evidence pointing in that direction. And his failure to share this information with the Democrats or notify them that he would be holding the press conference shows just how disingenuous his alarm really is. But its his intent to share classified investigatory information with the subjects of a counterintelligence (and potentially criminal) probe that constitutes a crime. He must not be very bright. And hes just destroyed his own committees investigation.\n\nJonathan Freedlund at The Guardian writesRex Tillerson is clearly out of the loop and out of his depth in Trumpland:\n\nThere is a charitable reading of Rex Tillersons interview with the previously obscure Independent Journal Review. When the secretary of state told the IJR that I didnt want this job, I didnt seek this job, that he was stunned when Donald Trump offered it to him, and that he only did it because my wife told me Im supposed to do this, its possible that he was displaying a charming modesty. Think of it as an elaborate version of the formulation favoured by celebrities on receiving an award: Im humbled. A more sceptical reading would suggest this was the former Exxon CEOs way of signalling that he is not a politician, that he exists on a higher plane than the usual crowd of jockeying Washington careerists. [...] Alternatively, Tillersons remarks could be read as an altogether less confident statement: a coded admission that he knows he is not qualified to be secretary of state, that hes in way over his head  but we shouldnt blame him, because it wasnt his idea. [...] Its tempting to see it that way, especially for those who want to believe cracks are becoming visible in the hull of the Trump ship, even from the inside.\n\nThe Editorial Board of The Guardian concludesRex Tillerson: a sidelined secretary of state:\n\nOf course, Mr Tillerson has only just begun. Its possible that apparent errors  such as parroting Chinese language on the bilateral relationship, and missing a key Nato meeting to meet the Chinese president Xi Jinping in the US  are not the result of chaos at the department, but deliberately taken actions designed to send clear messages. Generous interpreters suggest he is smart and capable enough to play the long game, taking a back seat while he builds his relationship with Mr Trump, his links to Generals Mattis and McMaster, and his understanding of foreign policy and government. But until and unless the day comes when he is ready and able to steer his own course, American foreign policy is subject to a combination of dangerous drift and equally alarming spurts of activity unchecked by institutional expertise. In the meantime the state department will have been shredded, its carefully acquired knowledge and understanding  boring, unglamorous, unremarkable but essential  left in tatters. And other powers around the world will step into the vacuum. I didnt want this job, Mr Tillerson told his interviewer. The president gave it to him anyway  but is not very interested, it appears, in allowing him to actually do it.\n\nThe Editorial Board of The New York Times opinesPresident Trumps Reckless Shame Game:\n\nPresident Trumps Homeland Security Department turned its immigration purge  and assault on the Constitution  up a notch this week. It posted the first of what it says will be weekly online reports identifying state and local law enforcement agencies that decline its requests to keep immigrants in jail to give federal agents time to pick them up. The idea is to name and shame these agencies, accusing them of recklessly loosing dangerous aliens onto the streets. The report, on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, trumpets itself as a Public Safety Advisory. It includes a grim warning from the acting ICE director, Thomas Homan, about the agencys requests, called detainers: When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICEs ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission. The accusation is dishonest. The report is a sham. And the claim of protecting public safety is ridiculous  dangerously so.\n\nKate Aronoff at In These Times writesHow the Left Is Using Tea Party Tactics To Take On Both the GOP and the Democratic Establishment:\n\nCoverage of groups like Indivisible has tended to focus on people who look a lot like the original Tea Partys basefor the most part, middle-aged white people, many of them having their first experience in activism. Yet the people behind #AllOfUs are almost exclusively millennials, most having cut their teeth in places like the Howard Dean and Sanders campaigns, and uprisings like Occupy Wall Street and the Movement for Black Lives. For Pierce and Sandberg, its important that any Tea Party of the Left formation be thoroughly multi-racial, with ample room for leadership available to millennials. Having also seen the boom and bust cycle of different campaigns and social movements, #AllOfUs sees the PAC, in part, as a way to keep post-inauguration resistance energy up over the long term. People are coming out to town halls, Pierce tells me, but what are they doing next? How are they staying involved? How are we building beyond 2017 and 2018, and starting to ask questions about 2020 and beyond? Its also, of course, a way to take back state power for progressives, and turn the Democrats into a party capable of beating Trumps agenda. Accordingly, #AllOfUs endorsed Keith Ellisons failed DNC leadership run, with several members signing off on a statement shortly after the defeat ensuring Tom Perez knew that theres still a fight within the Democratic Party, and promising to push for a Democratic Party that can actually be a vehicle for resisting Donald Trump and solving the crises in our country today.\n\nKai Wright at The Nation writesThe Health-Care Bill Embraces the GOPs Scariest State-Level Experiments:\n\nRyans American Health Care Act (AHCA) has rightly been called a tax break for the wealthy masquerading as reform. But its much more than thatits a vehicle for Ryan and other traditional, pre-Trump Republicans to achieve their decades-old goal of taking apart the Great Society. They colluded with neoliberal Democrats to end welfare, defund public education, and deregulate a predatory financial industry in the 1990s and 2000s. Whats left now is Medicare, Medicaid, and their promise that no American is too poor to get health care. Ryans bill would unambiguously end that promise. The AHCAs repeal of the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate is the least of it. Ryan would not just halt Obamacares Medicaid expansion; he would shrink it by at least 14 million people over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Given the sweeteners with which the administration is enticing far-right lawmakers, even that estimate is likely too rosy.\n\nBrian Beutler at The New Republic writesThe Donald Trump Show Is Flopping:\n\nThe Donald Trump Show is suffering from a ratings collapse unlike any since Arnold Schwarzenegger took over The Celebrity Apprentice. The showloosely defined as the circus-like environment Trump thrives in and tries to manufacture with unrepentant, outrageous conductwas critical to his success in the Republican primary and general election, both winner-take-all contests where the ability to command attention is invaluable.

But as Washington has become absorbed by Russia, tax returns, and Twitter tantrums, the rights legislative agenda has unfolded at breakneck pace in the states. In November, Republicans won a trifecta (control of both houses and the governorship) in four more states, bring the total to twenty-four (Democrats control just six). And its here that the most damage is being done, as the blueprint used in Scott Walkers Wisconsin and Sam Brownbacks Kansas is unrolled in Iowa, South Carolina, Kentucky, and New Hampshire. Consider Iowa. In November, the Republicans gained two seats in the statehouse (increasing their majority to 59-41) and six seats in the state senateflipping control from 25-23 Democratic to 29-20 Republican. In recent years, Republican aspirations and priorities in the statethe usual medley of tax cuts, privatization, and starvation of the public sectorhave been clear enough, as has the role of the senate in blocking passage of the nastiest and craziest legislative proposals. But no one fully anticipated how quickly and dramatically the new trifecta would act. The battle in Wisconsin unfolded over months after Walker took office in 2011. In Iowa it was more like a bomb was dropped; three weeks into the legislative session, the damage was done. The first blow was House File 291, a gutting of public-sector collective bargaining that was unveiled February 7 and signed by the governor ten days later. As in most states, Iowas public-sector bargaining law was a bipartisan bargain struck in the early 1970s, which raised pay and labor standards for public workers (especially teachers) in exchange for an effective no-strike pledge. The new public-employee relations code outdoes even Wisconsin in dismantling this bargain. Bargaining is now limited to base wages, with annual increases limited to 3 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. All other contract detailshealth care, pensions, working conditionsare off the table. Public-sector unions must win a recertification vote before each new contract (every two to three years). To twist that knife, the law requires the union to win a majority of workers in the bargaining unit (not just those voting) and it requires for the union to pay for the election. And unions are now barred from collecting dues through payroll deduction, a practice that was already voluntary. Having landed a decisive blow against middle-class jobs and wages, legislators next took a jab at the states lowest-paid workers. Since raising its minimum wage to $7.25 in 2008 (just before the federal increase to that rate), Iowa has allowed labor standards to languish. In response, four Iowa counties raised local minimums, all pushing the rate over $10 by 2019. The merits of the local increases were clear: they effectively targeted poor working parents, raised the minimum closer to a basic living standard, and did so while posing little threat to employment. Enter House File 295, passed March 9 by the statehouse and on track to be approved by the senate. The bill preempts local action on minimum wages, paid family leave, and other conditions of employment. For good measure, it also strips cities and counties of the right to levy soda taxes or ban plastic bags. (Language aimed at protecting discriminatory landlords and blocking local civil-rights initiatives were dropped from the version passed.)

He chose that locale, he said, because it best illustrated the \"two Americas\" he had spoken about since 2004. The message was simple and delivered with heartfelt and palpable anger: one America works hard but still struggles while another works little and lives a lavish lifestyle. This theme of \"two Americas\" and the twin idea of social injustice permeated almost every aspect of his campaign. Yet, back in 2006 and 2007, his message was met with skepticism in the traditional media. High-paid members of the chattering class shook their heads at his angry rhetoric and questioned whether the tone of his message was turning off voters. Indeed, for many Americans, while they agreed with the principle idea of a divided America, they did so only in abstract sense. While one could sympathize with the 47 million uninsured, the families living paycheck to paycheck, and the senior citizens choosing between food and medicine, many could not empathize with these situations. Poverty, or even the possibility of poverty, was not a daily worry for most Americans. Sure, in 2005, America was jostled into at least acknowledging the existence of this hidden America when Hurricane Katrina hit. The storm's waters glistened like a reflecting pool and showed Americans the one facet of our nation that was up until that point hidden in the shadows of national shame.\n\nHIGH IMPACT STORIES  TOP COMMENTS\n\nOn todays Kagro in the Morning show: Hey, surprise!

But here is one thing that is not so complicated: if people have modest means and limited tax credits, and coverage is expensive, they will mostly buy health plans with lower premiums  and high deductibles. This is what is likely to happen under the GOP health care bill, the American Health Care Act. Only people who need more health care will stretch for more generous coverage. If that happens, those health plans will draw too many sick people, causing insurance companies to stop offering them for fear of losing money. That would leave mostly the low-premium, high-deductible plans. [T]he average deductible for a typical plan in the non-group market under the GOP plan would be about $1,550 higher in 2017 than it would have been under the Affordable Care Act, based on our analysis for this column.

Add on to that the $1,550 more that would have to be paid for the policy. The CBO estimates that deductibles are going to increase for everyone, with insurance companies covering 65 percent of medical expenses on average under Trumpcare, compared to the average 72 percent covered by Obamacare.\n\nBottom line?

This high growth rate of CO 2 is also being observed at some 40 other sites in NOAAs Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. [...] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is under attack by the Trump administration, the GOP held congress and conservative allies representing fossil fuel corporations. It is all part of a plan by conservatives to derail the climate change fight. On Friday, NOAA fought back against Judicial Watch by asking a DC federal judge to toss a Freedom of Information Act request made by the right wing organization which alleges that NOAA violated a federal information disclosure law by failing to turn over emails related to the measurement of global temperature data.\n\nClimateDenierRound writesHeartlands Denier Conference Kicks Off, As Does Denial-Debunking Course: Today begins Heartlands annual Denier-palooza conference , where an esteemed group of so-called experts will be presenting their various versions of a reality where CO2 isnt causing warming and fossil fuels are our lord and savior .

According to InsideEPA , his resignation was spurred by infighting among appointees and being frozen out of the decision-making process. Schnare complained about his treatment at the EPA to the Daily Callers Michael Bastasch . Surprisingly, it sounds as though the problem is between Schnare and Pruitts team, with Pruitt et al keeping Schnare out of important meetings. Among Schnares concerns were that Pruitt never met with most of the transition team, that Pruitt has no experience with the EPA and hasnt hired anyone who does, and that Pruitt never even received the transition plan that the transition team put together ( which means that Myron Ebell, for all his sound and fury, had even less influence than we thought when we reported on his interviews as nothing more than  an attempt to remain relevant ) Schnare has promised to write more about resignation, and it sounds as though its his ideological allies among the political appointees who are to blame. Which means his eventual bean-spilling (self-serving as it will certainly be) may end up being yet another blotch on Trumps already polka-dotted hiring record.\n\nrktect writesIPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and 2018 US elections: The IPCC has determined the need for a special peer reviewed report.

Christophe Mazurier explains: In an article published on the World Economic Forums website on 28th Jan two years ago, former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) Christiana Figueres outlined four conclusions on climate from the 2015 edition of the WEF. It was the final run-up to the 21st Conference Of Parties on climate change (ie COP21) which was to be held in Paris in early December of that year. Observers and analysts were eager to find positive signs that international action was going to be taken against climate change, and they were looking at international fora and subsequent declarations to pick up any new information. Mrs Figueres four points were made in that context. First, she argued, renewable energies had become mature, citing solar and wind [as] no longer marginal. Technological progress combined with low oil prices had to favour this. Secondly, the shifts in the oil market were making it less profitable, and oil was now a lot more expensive to produce. Thirdly, companies were transforming and redirecting themselves toward low-carbon or zero-carbon operations in the understanding that the transformation is [] inevitable. Last but not least, she argued there was what she dubbed a gateway effect, which she explained as the necessity to act on climate change immediately because time was running out. [...] Sadly, it seems that the four key points that she had underlined in January 2015 as being favourable economic trends cannot help uphold the US and Chinas commitments on environmental action. The political context and lack of political will are blocking the process.\n\nAmmoLady writesSan Diego Climate: The Republican-led assault on reality and science, especially climate science is rapidly become a highway to the disaster zone  and clear out the other side!

However, federal scientists strongly disagree with Browns claim that best scientific thinking supports the construction of the tunnels. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has released a draft biological opinion documenting the harm the tunnels would cause to salmon, steelhead, Delta and longfin smelt, other fish and wildlife species, and water quality. An independent peer review panel found the NMFS findings are backed by comprehensive analyses, new data, and modeling,; according to a statement from the Golden Gate Salmon Association (GGSA).

Looking now at a faded transcript, it was assigned reading for English 103 Modern Science and Sociology. I cant exactly put into words why that book had such an impact on me other than to say it stirred some deep emotions connected to my love of nature for as long as I can remember. Rachel Carsons work has given me pause to think, to act, and to appreciate the beauty of nature my entire life. So much so that whenever I find a hatched birds egg in late spring, I think of Silent Spring. Silent Spring was one of the landmark books of the 20th century and was motivated by Carsons love of nature. It took her four years to complete and meticulously describe how DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) entered the food chain and accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals where its metabolites made bird eggshells thinner leading to egg breakage and embryo death. She described DDT as a human carcinogen contributing to cancer and genetic damage. She surmised that DDT and other pesticides had irrevocably harmed animals and had contaminated the worlds food supply. In one chapter, and most famously referenced, she depicts a nameless American town where everything from children to fish to birds to blossoms had been silenced by the harmful effects of DDT.\n\nENERGY\n\nthecriticalpolitical writesTrump Legislation helps Big Energy while Destroying the Environment: H.J.Res.41 nullifies the 2016 SEC regulation which was designed to promote transparency about payments related to resource extraction, including payments made to the US government and payments made to foreign governments. By nullifying this SEC regulation, the Trump administration clears the way for foreign money and influence to roll unchecked into the United States energy market. It also allows US dollars to be paid to foreign governments to invest in resource extraction in other countries, but companies are no longer required to report how much money was paid or to what country it was paid. Essentially, energy companies may do business with anyone, including our enemies, and are not required to report that business. They are able to sell our resources to anyone, including our enemies and are not required to report that business. This will increase global environmental damage by continuing to promote the extraction of fossil fuels worldwide. It will undoubtedly increase corruption by reducing transparency and allowing money from corrupt, enemy states to flow through our economy.

Beijing is hoping to right the ship on what has been probably the most easily understandable example of what pollution can do to a major city. Right now, the fix has been to move to a combination of natural gas and nuclear power, but this too is unsustainable.The Huangneng Beijing Thermal Power Plant, the last coal utility in operation in the city, was first brought on line in 1999. Beijing has over five million more people living it since, meaning more energy, more coal, more cars, and more health problems associated with pollution. It has five coal-fired power plants with a total installed capacity of 845,000 kilowatts. Du Chengzhang, the plants general manager, told Xinhua news agency on Sunday that the plant was an efficient and environmental friendly plant with advanced emission treatment equipment. But after the suspension of the plant on Saturday, roughly 1.76 million tons of coal, 91 tons of sulfur dioxide and 285 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions a year will be cut, Xinhua reported.\n\nwalterc writesMr. Peabody's coal train is back: Peabody Energy is back in the news.

St. Leo University also weighed in with a survey of their own, which gives Nelson a similar 39-34 edge.\n\nThese are the third and fourth polls we've seen this month pitting the two against each other, and the results have been quite consistent so far. A University of North Florida poll gave Nelson a 44-38 edge, while Mason-Dixon had Nelson leading 46-41. It's always better to have an early lead than an early deficit, but as wary Democrats will remember, early polls gave Charlie Crist a double-digit edge over Scott in the 2014 gubernatorial contest, and Scott didn't lead in any public surveys until early April of 2014.\n\nSt. Leo also took a very hypothetical look at a general election between wealthy Democratic attorney John Morgan and GOP state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, and gave Morgan a 26-20 lead. The pollster also surveyed both parties' primaries, but they sampled fewer than 300 people per primary, which falls below what we consider an acceptable sample size.\n\n IN-Sen: OK, then. A few days ago, freshman GOP Rep. Jim Banks said he would discuss a possible bid against Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly with his family in a few months. But on Monday, Banks told Roll Call's Simone Path, \"No, I'm not running for Senate next year.\"\n\nHowever, a different member of the Hoosier State's House delegation isn't sending mixed signals. Rep. Luke Messer recently said that he would decide in a couple of months, but this week, Messer announced that he was forming a statewide campaign finance committee. Messer could still back out, but he's clearly laying the groundwork to get in. GOP Rep. Todd Rokita is also flirting with a bid.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n MN-Gov: A Democratic source recently told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that Democratic Rep. Tim Walz was telling people he had decided to run for governor, and it sounds like we'll know where things stand with him shortly. Walz told Roll Call on Monday that he expects to decide \"in the very, very near future,\" and, when asked if that meant he'd make up his mind within a week, Walz responded, \"I think so.\" Walz' southern Minnesota seat swung from 50-48 Obama all the way to 53-38 Trump and Democrats won't have an easy time holding it without Walz, though the congressman expressed confidence Team Blue could do it.\n\n NJ-Gov: Ex-Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy has launched his second spot of the year ahead of the June 6 Democratic primary. This ad goes directly after Donald Trump, superimposing unflattering video of Trump on Trump Tower as the narrator hits his ultra-conservative policies and how \"his administration brags about 'alternative facts.'\" Murphy is then shown speaking to a crowd pledging to fight back. There is no word on the size of the buy, but Murphy can afford to spend whatever he wants to get his message out in this expensive state.\n\nMeanwhile we'll talk about \"comedian\" Joe Piscopo again. Yay. Piscopo has confirmed that he will not seek the GOP nomination, and that if he runs, he'll run as an independent. Piscopo says he'll make a decision by May; the filing deadline to run as an independent in New Jersey is June 6.\n\n TN-Gov: Apparently, there aren't enough Tennessee Republicans considering running for this open seat. State Sen. Mark Green kicked off his bid early, but Trump is reportedly planning to nominate him to serve as secretary of the Army. Fellow state Sen. Mae Beavers tells The Tennessean, after she heard that Green may be quitting the race, she \"decided to explore the possibility\" of running. Beavers, an ardent social conservative who is still trying to define marriage in Tennessee as between one man and one woman, did not explicitly say she would only consider running if Green doesn't.\n\nThe only other declared candidate is rich guy Randy Boyd, the former commissioner of the state's Department of Economic and Community Development. However, he may have some company soon. In response to reports that she was calling people to tell them she's going to run, state House Speaker Beth Harwell says she'll make her decision after the legislative session ends in the middle of April. A number of other Republicans are also eyeing this seat.\n\nHouse\n\n KS-02: While Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins announced that she would retire almost two weeks ago, no credible candidates from either party have announced that they'll run here. However, that may change soon. Brian McClendon recently left his position as Uber's vice president of maps and business platform and said he was moving back to Kansas to \"explore politics.\" McClendon didn't explicitly say what he was looking at, though on Twitter he hinted he was interested in this Topeka-area seat. It's unclear if McClendon identifies with a party, though his many anti-Trump tweets mean he probably won't run as a Republican if he seeks office.\n\nTrump carried this seat 56-37, so it will be a tough lift for a Democrat. If McClendon runs, he may have the connections he'd need to raise money. However, McClendon hasn't lived in Kansas in 30 years, and his opponents would undoubtedly portray him as a carpetbagger. Ex-state House Minority Leader Paul Davis, who carried this seat 51-45 during his unsuccessful 2014 bid against Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, has acknowledged he has been approached to run here, though he's expressed interest in another gubernatorial campaign.\n\n MI-01: Democrats targeted this northern Michigan seat last cycle, but tea partying Republican Jack Bergman defeated a well-funded opponent 55-40 as the district swung from 54-45 Romney to 58-37 Trump. It's unlikely Democrats will prioritize this race next year after that depressing result, but at least one potential candidate is considering.

Ryans calculations are correct. While some GOP moderates in Congress think the bill is too conservative, most of the Republicans in Ryans conference predisposed to oppose this bill hail from red districts where Trump is popular, but the Speaker is not. Trump needs this bill to pass as much as Ryan does; it would be unheard of for a new presidents first major legislative initiative to fail as a result of opposition from within his own partys ranks. Trumps reported pledge to support primary challenges against Republican holdouts is, in a way, a potent one. Conservative members who balk at voting for a bill their constituents see as too liberal arent going to be punished for voting their principles. Voters may be persuaded to abandon their representatives, however, if the issue isnt the GOPs health care bill but a litmus test measuring loyalty to President Trump. That threat only works if the American Health Care Act is seen as a proxy for Trump, and that means the president has to endorse it enthusiastically. Hes done just that. Whether the White House likes it or not, its TrumpCare from this point forward. Clearly, thats just how Paul Ryan wanted it.\n\nI expect it to pass the House.

What topics would you like me to address? Among the replies: Ban sharia law from US,, Officially identify Islam as a political system and not a religion and ask how we can get islam [sic] ed out our schools & universities? No one familiar with Gabriela Lebanese-born Christian who distorts Lebanese history to incite hatred of Muslimswould find those replies surprising. Her organization, ACT for America, is the largest grassroots purveyor of anti-Muslim bigotry in the United States.\n\nGabriel's organization has been a prominent part of the extremist anti-Muslim movement for years; Gabriel not only promotes conspiracy theories of \"sharia\" infiltration but declares Islam itself to be incompatible with American citizenship. ACT has a close relationship with this White House; now-departed Michael Flynn was last year announced as an advisery member of their board of directors.\n\nIn 2007, [Gabriel] declared that If a Muslim who haswho isa practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah, who abides by Islam, who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a daythis practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America. After Khizr Khan held up a copy of the US Constitution in his speech at last years Democratic national convention, Gabriel accused him of lying. Waving the Constitution, she declared, is a misrepresentation when ones religion teaches that it and any other man-made law, for that matter, are to be removed and superseded by the Quran.\n\nAs pure aside: A useful exercise, here in America, would be to prop a video camera in front of any conservative Christian legislator and ask them whether or not they believe \"God's law\" supersedes American law if the two are in conflict.

Or you could ask, say, Brigitte Gabriel, on her way to or from the Trump White House or Mar-a-Lago, where she has also enjoyed Donald Trump's hospitality.\n\nBut that is neither here nor there; the more immediate news is that the Trump White House continues to solicit the input of those that believe Islam itself to be an enemy of America.

Health care:\n\nThat's the kind of headline that pisses off Republicans and their enablers. Comparing the good ol' USA with anything...ewwwwwww  European is barely short of treasonous. Of course, if they had an ounce of real pride in their country and compassion for their fellow Americans, they would be irked not by the headline but by its accuracy. What they have instead is an open spigot of cash from corporadoes keen on keeping a health-care system that costs more but delivers less than health-care systems in Europe and Canada. During 2010, according to theCommonwealth Fund's Biennial Health Insurance Survey released last Tuesday, 52 million Americansthat's the total population of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and the Netherlandshad no health insurance in all or part of the year. In 2001, the number was 38 million. That's a 35 percent increase in a decade when the U.S. population rose only 10 percent. Not only did all the people in those six countries have health coverage, each of their health-care systems were rated better than America's. Bottom line: They cost less, provide more, cover everybody. Unsurprisingly, one of the main reasons the number of uninsured soared to this record high is because the deep recession that put millions out of a job took their health coverage along with it. Nearly three of five who lost their jobs also wound up uninsured. []\n\nHIGH IMPACT STORIES  TOP COMMENTS\n\nOn todays Kagro in the Morning show: Our 3/22/16 show fills in.

The entire concept of social media works by making peoples thoughts, pictures, and other assorted moments into a way to pass the day for followers and friends, while allowing Facebook, Twitter, and Google to sell stuff and use your personal data . Weve become a culture which makes our own lives into a form of entertainment that we give away for free. For some, this is a way to connect and keep in touch with people in a more intimate way, one that goes beyond picking up a phone. For others, its an ego trip where they get to feed their own inflated sense of self-worth, like a small child standing in the middle of the floor screaming: Look at me!\n\nUnfortunately for us, someone in the latter category is now president of the United States and the world has to revolve around the crazy shit a former reality TV show host might tweet out every day, because hes in charge of important things.\n\nAnd obviously, therein lies the problem. Reality television is predicated on three things which arent conducive to good, stable government: fighting, scandal, and dysfunction. Every one of those programs, even the ones where were supposed to be watching the search for the next great pop star, or the search for true love, or how rich people with everything live their lives, is based around things going wrong. Otherwise, it would be boring TV. On The Voice, theres always a singer who messes up and starts bawling. Theres always going to be an episode of The Bachelor where people have sex and then things end badly. On any of Bravos Real Housewives programs, someone is fucking someone elses husband or girlfriend, someone is lying to someone else, and someone is screaming at someone else about how they did them wrong. And, to a certain extent, the people at the center of these programs like it this way, because it means their lives are interesting and theyre the center of attention for the people who watch this crap.\n\nDonald Trump is a creature of ego. Thats why hes usually more concerned about his own personal image than policy, and has a conniption if someone mentions his small hands or dares to think his bank account might not be as big as he suggests. But the way things have unfolded for more than a year, in both the campaign and now in the first months of this presidency, one way to look at this is that Trump operates on the dynamics of Reality TV. Because on Reality TV, you can lie and be obnoxious and still have fans. In fact, those fans make excuses for the peoples terrible behavior. And one can do horrible things, some of which are criminal, and people will still watch the stupidity every week. In the end, the people on these programs feel validated in their behavior because they get attention and someone is paying them to be horrible people.\n\nDoes any of this feel familiar?", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/21/1640618/-The-presidency-has-been-degraded-into-bad-reality-TV#read-more", "date": "2017/3/21"}, {"text": "On Tuesday, tea partying ex-Nevada Assemblywoman Sharron Angle, who is best known for losing the legendary 2010 U.S. Senate race to Democrat Harry Reid, announced that she would challenge GOP Rep.

However, Angle lost last years Senate primary to party favorite Joe Heck by a brutal 65-23 margin, so thats a massive if. Angle is running as a Trump ally but Amodei served as Trumps state chairman, so shell likely have a tough time portraying the incumbent as insufficiently pro-Donald. Amodei is considering leaving this seat behind to run for state attorney general and Angle would almost certainly have a better shot in a crowded open seat race, but she doesnt seem to have many allies left even in Nevadas far-right political community.\n\nStill, even if this bid goes as badly for Angle as her last campaign did, well always have our many memories of the former assemblywoman.

Director Comey needs to answer one question: If he had information about the extent of Russias efforts to hack Donald Trumps political opponents last July, why would he effectively advance their efforts by releasing a letter confirming a review of newly uncovered Clinton emails from an unrelated investigation in October that turned out to reveal no new information?

It's so much not in a death spiral that health insurers are seeing unprecedented stock gains, and their profits haven't stunk, either.\n\nSince March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the managed care companies within the Standard & Poors 500-stock index  UnitedHealth, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and Centene  have risen far more than the overall stock index. This is no small matter: The stock market soared during that period. The numbers are astonishing. The Standard & Poors stock index returned 135.6 percent in those seven years through Thursday, a performance that we may not see again in our lifetimes.

UnitedHealth, the biggest of the managed care companies, with a market capitalization that is now more than $160 billion, returned 480 percent, dividends included. An investment of $100 in the companys stock when Obamacare was signed into law would be worth more than $580.50 today.

And do they really need to be rescued by Congress?\n\nSheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research for Mizuho Securities, says there are some problems with Obamacare as far as the insurers are concerned.

His racist views were first exposed in 1988 when a series of private memos he wrote for principals at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) were leaked to the press. The memos were filled with racist statements and warned about a coming \"Latin onslaught.\" At the time, Tantons group U.S. English, which opposed bilingualism in public schools and government agencies, disavowed any racial motivation. Hispanics who learn English will be able to avail themselves of opportunities, explained its president, former Reagan administration official Linda Chavez. She resigned when Tantons memos were leaked. The news that U.S. English had received funds from the distributor of The Camp of the Saints, a racist French novel in which starving Third World refugees overrun Europe, added to Chavezs sense of betrayal.\n\nThe novel has recently re-emerged, with HuffPo noting that white nationalist and senior counselor to Trump, Steve Bannon, has used this stunningly racist novel to demonize Muslims. Other papers from Tantons library show he has for decades been at the heart of the white nationalist scene. He has corresponded with Holocaust deniers, former Klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era. And according to Think Progress, Tanton is a strict nativist who once wrote a paper titled The Case for Passive Eugenics. Charming.\n\nStill, SPLC doesnt have to rely on Tantons moldy papers in order to make the case that CIS belongs on the baddies list. Krikorian does a mighty fine job himself, once referring to respected journalist and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos as a white-Hispanic ethnic hustler. In 2009, Kirkorian had a fit over Sonia Sotomayors name. Really. A year later, Krikorian argued, following the devastating earthquake there, that Haiti is so screwed up because it wasnt colonized long enough by white people.\n\nThen theres CIS weekly email roundup. Lord. According to Krikorians own words, the roundup of immigration commentary has occasionally included pieces translation: this has happened a couple timesby writers who turned out to be cranks. The cranks, according to SPLC, have actually been anti-Semites and Holocaust-deniers, one of whom called Jewish people truly subversive, manipulative, and evil. Or maybe have some vices, Kirkorian might argue.\n\nKrikorian also tries to slither out of the infamous Jason Richwine scandal, saying that CIS has published work by independent researcher Jason Richwine, who wrote a contentious Harvard University dissertation on IQ a decade ago. What Kirkorian doesnt mention is that Richwine was forced to resign from his job because that contentious dissertation, which basically argued that the children and grandchildren of immigrants will always be dumber than white people. From Imagine 2050:\n\nIn May 2013, Richwine co-authored a deeply flawed Heritage Foundation study on the fiscal impact of immigration. He resigned in disgrace later that week following revelations first published by The Washington Post that Richwine wrote a racist doctoral dissertation, titled IQ and Immigration Policy, asserting there are persistent racial differences in IQ. No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach IQ parity with whites, Richwine writes at one point in his dissertation, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-IQ children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against. As Imagine 2050 noted around the time of the Heritage reports release, Richwines work is easily fit within the tradition of the Pioneer Funds bigoted legacy of so-called race realism. CIS was aware of Richwines bigoted argument well before the release of the Heritage report and details of Richwines IQ and Immigration Policy surfaced.\n\nFYI, Mark: The son of immigrants authored this post.\n\nFinally, not even the magic of Christmas Day is sacred, with SPLC noting that CIS staffer John Miano attended VDAREs holiday party last December. VDAREnamed after Virginia Dare, the first white child born in the Americasfocuses on opposing non-white immigration into the United States, but has also published the writings of anti-Semites. And according to SPLC, Ann Coulter may have also been at that holiday party too. Talk about a white Christmas.\n\nWhen it comes to immigration, CIS is in the minority here. Nearly two-thirds of Americans prefer a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants rather than deportation, according to recent polling. And no ones trying to silence CISby Kirkorians own account, the group has testified in front of Congress some 200 times.

The confinement inflicted more pain on her as she gave birth, left marks on her body and made it harder for hospital workers to give her an epidural, court papers say.

They were told that the agency would be conducting operations in the Austin area as a result of the sheriffs new policy and because a meeting between ICE and Hernandez in January didnt go very well, according to an audio transcript obtained by the Observer. Bryant confirmed that was the case. The Austin American-Statesman first reported the story. In February, Hernandez implemented a policy limiting her departments cooperation with detainer requests from ICE to undocumented immigrants charged with serious crimes, such as murder, aggravated sexual assault and human trafficking. Such policies have attracted opposition from the Trump administration, Governor Greg Abbott and other Republican lawmakers.\n\nWhat ICE has always preferred is for local law enforcement to hold all undocumented immigrantseven those arrested for minor reasons, like traffic offensesin jail for them to pick up later. But this is a waste of local resources and destroys the fragile trust between immigrant communities and police. If members of the community dont trust law enforcement, they are less likely to report crimes, and that makes the entire community less safe for all. So, knowing where she lives best, Sheriff Hernandez took actionand apparently, so did ICE.\n\nAccording to the Austin American-Statesman, ICE characterized the operation as routine and said the Austin area was not being targeted. But as immigration advocates have long known, what ICE says and what ICE does are two different things.

Democrats should be insisting that these hearings and the vote that is supposed to follow be suspended until the cloud over Trump is resolved. The very legitimacy of his presidency is in question, and the idea that he could ultimately affect the balance of the Supreme Court for the next three decades with this nomination is more than unseemly.

The hearings are under the big, black cloud of the FBI investigation of Trump's campaign and the very real taint that Gorsuch's nomination came from a president who may prove to be illegitimate.\n\nOn top of that, Gorsuch is applying for what every Democratic senator believes is a job that Republicans stole from Merrick Garland, the man President Obama nominated for this seat a year ago.

Luke Messer and Todd Rokita both sound very interested in challenging Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly next year, and a third member of the House delegation isn't saying no. Rep. Jim Banks, who was elected last year, declined to rule out a bid back in December before he was even sworn in, but he went silent afterwards. But Banks tells WIBC that, while he's totally not thinking about the race, he plans to talk about it with his family after everyone's had time to adjust to his commute to D.C. During his last campaign, Banks earned the support of powerful anti-establishment groups like the Club for Growth, but there's no guarantee that they'd back him if he ran for the Senate.\n\n NJ-Sen Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez was indicted in April of 2015 on charges of bribery, fraud, conspiracy, and making false statements: Prosecutors alleged that Menendez used his office to benefit a friend of his, wealthy eye surgeon Salomon Melgen, who had provided Menendez with lavish gifts, including private air travel. However, Menendez's trial still hasn't taken place, and state Democratic leaders have signaled that they plan to support his re-election campaign next year. But it doesn't look like Menendez will be able to run out the clock. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the senator's case, and Menendez's trial remains scheduled for Sept. 6.\n\nGubernatorial\n\n IL-Gov: On Monday, state Sen. Daniel Biss joined what is becoming a crowded Democratic primary to face GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner next year. Biss, a former University of Chicago math professor who represents Evanston and several other northern Chicago suburbs, will need to raise a lot of money to get his name out in this very expensive state. Last year, Biss was the lead elected official publicly involved with a well-funded labor-backed super PAC that aided Democrats in state legislative races, so he may have the connections he'll need.\n\nBiss joins businessman Chris Kennedy, Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, and Madison County Regional Superintendent of Schools Bob Daiber in the primary, while venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker recently formed an exploratory committee. Kennedy and especially Pritzker will likely have plenty of money at their disposal, while Pawar and Daiber still have to prove themselves. However, it's possible that even a longshot like Daiber could benefit if he gets to be the one primary candidate who hails from outside the Chicago area. Illinois has a relatively early primary in March of next year, but it may be a while before this contest firms up. State Sen. Andy Manar (who also hails from downstate Illinois), Chicago City Treasurer Kurt Summers, and Rep. Robin Kelly have all expressed interest in getting in, while state Sen. Kwame Raoul and ex-Gov. Pat Quinn haven't ruled it out.\n\n MN-Gov, MN-01: Democratic Rep. Tim Walz has been flirting with a bid for governor, and an unnamed Democratic source tells the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the congressman is \"telling people he is running,\" and that we should expect an announcement \"soon.\" If Walz wins the Democratic nod, Team Blue may benefit from having a candidate who has won in areas that flipped from Obama to Trump last year. However, Walz's southern House seat will be far from an easy hold without the incumbent. This district, which includes Rochester and Mankato, swung from 50-48 Obama all the way to 53-38 Trump.\n\n NJ-Gov: Decades after his acting career peaked, ex-Saturday Night Live cast member Joe Piscopo has apparently found out a way to wring out a few more months of renewed media attention. NJ Advance Media reports that Piscopo has decided not to run for governor this year as a Republican, but is \"planning\" to campaign as an independent. Piscopo hasn't said that publicly, though his recent declaration that, \"There is no way a Republican can win in New Jersey\" was a strong sign the Trump supporter would not run under Team Red's banner. Piscopo currently hosts a radio show that he would need to give up as soon as he declared, which gives him some incentive to wait as long as possible. Of course, there's no guarantee Piscopo will run: Piscopo also mulled a 2005 independent bid, but didn't go for it in the end.\n\n OH-Gov: Democratic Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley has been openly considering a bid to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. John Kasich in 2018, and she is reportedly \"expected to announce any day now\" according to WVXU's Howard Wilkinson. Whaley also will supposedly have the support of Cincinnati's Democratic Mayor John Cranley if she does run. The mayor recently avoided one major impediment when she drew no challenger for re-election in 2017, giving Whaley the freedom to pursue a 2018 bid for higher office without having to worry about awkwardly campaigning for another term in the meantime.\n\nRepublicans aren't the only ones with a crowded primary for governor (see our OH-Gov entry above). Whaley would join a Democratic field that includes former Rep. Betty Sutton, ex-state Rep. Connie Pillich, and state Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavoni. Even more candidates could jump in, since state Supreme Court Justice Bill O'Neill, former Youngstown Mayor Jay Williams, and former state Sen. Nina Turner are all considering.\n\nIt's possible that such a jumbled field for both parties will lead to some candidates switching to seek a different office, especially since candidates for lieutenant governor have to run on a ticket with their gubernatorial nominee.\n\n TN-Gov: State House Speaker Beth Harwell hasn't been subtle about her interest in this open seat, and she opened a new fundraising account at the beginning of the year. But while Harwell hasn't announced that she'll seek the GOP nod yet, ex-state party chair Susan Richardson Williams says that Harwell recently contacted her and told her she was in. The Times Free Press says that Harwell is likely to announce after the legislative session ends in late April or early May.\n\n VA-Gov: On Monday, ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell endorsed former RNC head Ed Gillespie in the June GOP primary. McDonnell left office in early 2014 with ethical black clouds hanging over his head, and he was convicted later that year for bribery. However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned that conviction last year, ruling that the \"officials acts\" necessary to support a corruption charge had been defined too broadly; prosecutors soon announced that they would not retry the case. Gillespie doesn't seem to have a problem accepting an endorsement from McDonnell, since his campaign issued a press release touting the ex-governor's support.\n\nHouse\n\n CA-34: The crowded April 4 jungle primary for this safely blue downtown Los Angeles seat is coming up quickly, and while it's very likely that two Democrats will advance to the June general election, it remains to be seen which two. Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez has the support of the state party establishment and several prominent labor groups, so it would be a big surprise if he didn't make it to round two; still, anything's possible in a low-turnout contest. However, things are a bit more muddled for the second spot. Arturo Carmona, who served as Bernie Sanders's deputy political director during last year's presidential primary, is hoping to win over enough Sanders' supporters to prevail. But while Sanders hasn't issued an endorsement, the pro-Sanders National Nurses United union has thrown its backing behind Carmona.\n\nMeanwhile, former Los Angeles City Council aide Sara Hernandez is up with her second spot. Just like in her first ad, Hernandez goes directly after Trump, with the narrator declaring that, \"Teacher Sara Hernandez has three lessons for Donald Trump.\" The commercial touts her support for healthcare, immigrants, and public schools; Hernandez ends by saying, \"I've been a classroom teacher, and I know how to deal with bullies.\" There is no word on the size of the buy: At the end of December, Hernandez trailed only Gomez in cash on hand. So far, former Obama White House staffer Alejandra Campoverdi is the only other candidate to advertise on TV.\n\n GA-06: On behalf of the blog ZPolitics, the conservative pollster Clout Research is out with their second survey of the April 18 all-party primary for Georgia's 6th Congressional District. Their numbers are below, with the results of their February poll in parenthesis:\n\nInvestigative documentary maker Jon Ossoff (D): 41 (32) Ex-Secretary of State Karen Handel (R): 16 (25) Businessman Bob Gray (R): 16 (11) State Sen. Judson Hill (R): 9 (9) Ex-state Sen. Dan Moody (R): 5 (2) Ex-state Sen. Ron Slotin (D): 3 (not tested in February) Certified public accountant David Abroms (R): 2 (not tested in February) Businessman Bruce LeVell (R): 1 (1)\n\nIn the likely event that no one takes a majority of the vote in April, the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to a June runoff. At least according to this poll, Jon Ossoff looks very well-positioned to reach the runoff, while Karen Handel's stock has dropped a bit. By contrast, rich guy Bob Gray, a Trump supporter who literally attempted to drain a swamp in one of his ads, could edge out Handel for the second runoff spot.\n\nBut there's one number Democrats will very much like. Back in February, Clout showed the GOP field taking a combined 48 percent of the vote, while Ossoff grabbed 31. In their March poll, the GOP still takes 48 percent while Ossoff and fellow Democrat Ron Slotin take a combined 44 percent. This seat has been Republican for decades, but it swung from 61-37 Romney to just 48-47 Trump. The April electorate will be different from the June electorate, but this survey at least indicates that more voters are keen to support the Democrats now than they were a short time ago.\n\nThere are a few big caveats. Not many groups have surveyed this race, and it's never a good idea to rely on one pollster. Clout Research, formerly known as Wenzel Strategies, also does not have a good record, and Clout has also displayed some strange habits in the past. This poll gives Ossoff some potentially good numbers, but Clout/Wenzel's lousy record alone is a good incentive to wait for more data.\n\n IA-02: Both state GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann and his son, state Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, have been mentioned as potential candidates against Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack, and the younger Kaufmann isn't saying no. Bobby Kaufmann tells the Quad-City Times that he hasn't ruled out a bid, and thinks he can wait until the end of the year before deciding. However, Kaufmann says that one factor will be if physician Christopher Peters runs again. Peters raised very little money last cycle and lost to Loebsack 54-46 as this eastern Iowa seat swung from 56-43 Obama to 49-45 Trump, but apparently, Peters impressed Kaufmann. For his part, Peters sounds likely to try again.\n\n NH-01: Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter chronically faces hard-fought battles in eastern New Hampshire's swingy 1st District, and after her seat favored Trump by 48-47, she will likely be a top Republican target in 2018 too. The latest name to come up as a possible Republican challenger is state Sen. Andy Sanborn, who finally acknowledged that he is considering the race after it was previously reported that he had already met with the NRCC.\n\nSanborn isn't the first candidate to express interest in running, but he's likely the one with the relatively biggest public profile so far, which could give him a leg up in a possible primary. The four-term state senator is one of only 24 members in the upper chamber, whereas a state representative would be just one out of 400. Also considering the race are state Rep. John Burt, former state Liquor Commission Enforcement and Licensing Director Eddie Edwards, and former state Commissioner of Health and Human Services John Stephen, who was also Team Red's 2010 gubernatorial nominee.\n\n OH-16: With GOP Rep. Jim Renacci leaving behind his Republican-leaning 16th District in northeastern Ohio to run for governor (see our OH-Gov item at the very top), there are a slew of potential candidates who might try to succeed him in 2018. No prospective candidates declared their intentions since Renacci's announcement, but Roll Call's Simone Path says Republican operatives have speculated that GOP Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor could drop her gubernatorial bid and switch offices to avoid a crowded primary. Over at Cleveland.com, Henry Gomez had played Great Mentioner back in February, giving us a few more possible contenders. He reported that Republican state Sen. Frank LaRose previously said that he would look at running if Renacci vacated\n\nGomez additionally suggested that the following Republicans could also run: state Rep. Christina Hagan, who was a passionate Trump backer in 2016; state Rep. Tom Patton, who is also a former state senator; state Senate President Larry Obhof; state Rep. Scott Wiggam; state Rep. Kristina Roegner; Wayne County Commissioner and former longtime state legislator Ron Amstutz; and finally, Cuyahoga County Republican Party Chairman Rob Frost. Frost said back in February that he thought it was inappropriate to discuss this race before Renacci made his plans clear, so he at least wasn't ruling it out then; Gomez also notes that Frost spoke well of Patton.\n\nThe 16thsupported Trump by 56-39, so it will likely be tough for Democrats. However, Democrat Betty Sutton only lost to Renacci 52-48 after the two incumbents were thrown into the same seat by the Republicans drawing the new congressional lines, so this seat may be worth keeping an eye on. Gomez reported back in February that ex-Parma Mayor Dean DePiero said he would consider running if Renacci didn't run again.\n\n UT-03, UT-Sen: Evan McMullin, who took 21 percent of the vote in Utah last year as a conservative independent presidential candidate, has expressed interest in challenging GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch in the past. On Friday, McMullin added that \"it is possible\" he will run against Hatch or GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz in 2018. McMullin didn't say whether he was considering running as a Republican or an independent. However, McMullin added that, \"Plenty of people outside of Utah or who do not vote in the Republican primary are eager to see Chaffetz replaced, for example. But he may be supported by his Republican primary voters, and if so, that has to be taken into account,\" so it sounds like he's considering both options. Last year, Trump defeated McMullin 47-24 in Chaffetz's seat, while Clinton actually came in third with 23 percent.\n\nMayoral\n\n Miami, FL Mayor: While Miami-Dade County has become reliably blue in presidential races, both the county government and the city of Miami are still run by Republicans, and that state of affairs may continue a while. Miami Mayor Toms Regalado is termed-out this year, and County Commissioner Francis Suarez has essentially had the field to himself for the last 10 months. Suarez, a Republican who got some fundraising help from GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, has raised $2 million so far, while none of his opponents have brought in much at all. The filing deadline isn't until September, but if anyone else is considering getting in, they're doing it quietly. The non-partisan race will be held on Nov. 7, and there will be a Nov. 21 runoff if no one takes a majority.\n\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, and Stephen Wolf, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, and James Lambert.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/21/1645504/-Morning-Digest-Wealthy-Trumpesque-Rep-Jim-Renacci-joins-crowded-GOP-primary-for-Ohio-governor#read-more", "date": "2017/3/21"}, {"text": "Cheers and Jeers for Tuesday, March 21, 2017\n\nNote: As we mentioned yesterday, C&J posting will be a bit spotty for awhile as we gather our medical generals to plan the launch of our War on Colon Cancer (which is not nearly as fun as the War on Christmas, but the victory will be infinitely more satisfying).

(Why the hell weren't we told about this before the freaking election???) Second, both Comey and NSA director Michael Rogers confirmed that Trump's iron-clad, no-wiggle-room \"This is McCarthyism!/Worse than Watergate!\" accusation that President Obama ordered a wire\"tapp\" on Trump Tower was a total lie. NBC News calls it a \"political gut punch,\" while USA Today says it shrouds the White House in a \"big gray cloud.\" And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, a former president of Mexico trolled him into oblivion:\n\nx .@realDonaldTrump, if this were TV, you'd be fired.

I remember it like it was just 2,555 days agomainly because I think it was. On March 21, 2010, after a huge amount of debate, number-crunching and input from the entire health care industry, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And what a collection of moments we saw...from blue dog Bart Stupak's grandstanding over abortion, to John Dingell showing off his historic Medicare gavel, to the House leadership locking arms and walking through a canopy of teabaggers like the protagonists of The Wizard of Oz skipping down the yellow brick road, to the hecklers that created \"mass hysteria\" (Barney Frank's term), and finally the moment that nobody wanted to arrive because they were all having so much darn fun: the 219-212 vote shortly before midnight. There was still work to do in the Senate, but this was nothing less than historic. Today Republicans are trying to destroy it, claiming the ACA is killing the insurance industry. But Jeff Sommer at The New York Times begs to differ:\n\nThe numbers are astonishing. The Standard & Poors stock index returned 135.6 percent in those seven years through Thursday, a performance that we may not see again in our lifetimes. But the managed care stocks, as a whole, have gained nearly 300 percent including dividends, according to calculations by Bespoke Investment Group. [] President Obama, Veep Biden, and senior staff react in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, as the House passes the health care reform bill, March 21, 2010. Basically, several analysts on Wall Street and in Washington said, the underlying businesses of the big managed care companies have actually done extremely well under Obamacare. They have run into some problems but are hardly in need of a rescue. The companies have notched profits---from expansion of Medicaid, for example, and from services aimed at cutting medical costs---while learning how to insulate themselves from parts of the law that have crimped their income.They have diversified, earning money from businesses that include data management, outpatient clinics and surgical services, as well as traditional health insurance.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has scheduled a vote to destroy the ACA on Thursday. He's facing a significant number of defectors, though, from his own party. But if they dont play ball he's prepared to levy the harshest punishment he can think of: making them enroll in Trumpcare.\n\nJEERS to how far we've fallen. On March 21, 1790, Thomas Jefferson reported to President Washington as America's first Secretary of State. Today a fatigue-prone, Russia-worshipping oil baron reports to President Donald Trump as Secretary of State. Still waiting for the punchline? That was the punchline.\n\nCHEERS to the wind beneath America's energy wings. This'll blow a happy breeze into your shorts this morning: Professor Juan Cole at Informed Comment has an update on wind energy in the U.S., and he's downright giddy about it:\n\n[I]t has emerged in the US as the number one renewable energy source, generating more electricity than hydro-electric for the first time.  Wind generates 5.5 percent of US electricity today, a percentage that is destined to spiral up from there. [...] Texas #1 source of wind. The industry has created thousands of jobs. Megan Murat writes poignantly about these upwardly mobile West Texas working families suddenly able to send their kids to college and to afford new homes. Think about it this way: All those things Trump promised American workers during the campaign and then reneged on? Wind really is fulfilling those promises! There are already 100,000 wind energy workers (only 80,000 coal workers), and that number will triple in the next few years. By 2020, only three years from now, Texas is slated to be the worlds fourth wind power giant after China, the US as a whole, and Germany.\n\nInstall a turbine inside the Texas legislature and it'll bump it up to third in a day.\n\n-\n\nTen years ago in C&J: March 21, 2007\n\nJEERS to life on Pluto.

File this under \"Thanks, Obama.\" It was #44's annual Nowruz greeting (and the right-wing freakout that always followed) to the Iranian people (including Iranian-Americans) that made me aware of the holiday, and it's a tradition I'm happy to continue. As Firoozeh Dumas writes in The New York Times, this is an especially good year to pause and send out positive vibes to our Iranian planet-mates:\n\nThen came 2017, and one night, while lamenting the deeply divided nature of this country, I had an epiphany. Every immigrant group has given something to this country,and we Iranians are here to present you, dear America,with Nowruz. Here is a holiday that asks only one thing of you---to have hope.It has been around for thousands of years. There is no controversy associated with Nowruz. No indigenous people were displaced, no wars were fought, and no one died for us to have this celebration. Unless winter comes up with some sordid revelation about spring, we are in the clear. While it is true that Nowruz has its origins in Zoroastrianism, one of the first monotheistic religions, who is going to argue with a religion whose maxim is Good thoughts, good words, good deeds? So America, please find an Iranian and, for a moment, forget about the headlines that divide us. Ask about Nowruz. You will probably be offered homemade baklava or a chickpea cookie. Please do try the chickpea cookies. They may sound strange to you, but rum balls didnt sound all that good to me, either. And while you are wondering why the cookies melt so quickly in your mouth (its the chickpea flour), lets talk. You might be surprised to find out that we have more in common than you think. That should give us all hope.\n\nAnd now, without further ado: [Fires glitter cannon.] \"Nowruzetan Pirooz!\" And many blessings on your goldfish.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday.

Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Comey said the bureau is conducting its investigation in an open-minded, independent way and vowed to follow the facts wherever they lead. There is no reason to doubt Mr. Comeys commitment. But it is far from certain that senior officials at the Department of Justice, who normally decide whether there is enough evidence to file criminal charges in politically sensitive cases, will be able to avoid White House interference. Before Mondays hearing began, Mr. Trump issued a remarkable set of tweets calling the possibility of collusion with Russia fake news and urging Congress and the F.B.I. to drop the matter and instead focus on finding who had been leaking information to the press. These brazen warning shots from the president do enormous damage to public confidence in the F.B.I.s investigation. The credibility of the Justice Department in handling the Russian matter was already deeply compromised after Attorney General Jeff Sessions arrived in the job refusing to recuse himself from any investigation. He was forced to step aside only after it was revealed that, contrary to what he told senators under oath, he had met with the Russian ambassador to Washington twice during the campaign. Even with his recusal, it would still be his deputies and staff directing and managing any potential prosecution  which raises serious questions of conflict.\n\nDana Milbank:\n\nThe partisan response made it plain that there will be no serious congressional investigation of the Russia election outrage, nor any major repercussions for Russia. We were attacked by Russia  about this there is no doubt  and were too paralyzed by politics to respond. Trump, whose claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower was dismissed by Comey on Monday, continued to fire his weapons of mass distraction Monday morning, tweeting about ties between Hillary Clinton and Russia and claiming the real story is who leaked classified information. This is to be expected from Trump.

These boards cut early voting hours and limited the locations where it would be offered. They also redrew precinct boundaries and moved polling places away from locations such as college campuses and predominantly black communities.

As a letter from nearly 50 civil rights, criminal justice, faith, and labor organizations points out, there are already measures in place to prevent drug users from getting unemployment benefitsfor instance, someone whose firing had anything to do with drug use is not eligible for benefits in virtually all states, and six states have passed legislation equating a failed or refused pre-employment drug screen with refusing suitable work. Drug testing unemployment applicants is also a waste of public money, since repeated experience has shown that very few people will be screened out by the tests.\n\nThe letter details two other serious problems.", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/20/1645348/-Got-laid-off-Republicans-plan-to-make-you-pee-in-a-cup-for-your-unemployment-benefits#read-more", "date": "2017/3/20"}, {"text": "CHUCK TODD:\n\nWell, that's an important revelation at this point. Let me ask you this. Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nWe did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, \"our,\" that's N.S.A., F.B.I. and C.I.A., with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nI understand that. But does it exist?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nNot to my knowledge.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nIf it existed, it would have been in this report?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nThis could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAt some--\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nBut at the time, we had no evidence of such collusion.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThere's a lot of smoke, but there hasn't been that smoking gun yet. At what point should the public start to wonder if this is all just smoke?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nWell, that's a good question. I don't know. I do think, though, it is in everyone's interest, in the current President's interests, in the Democrats' interests, in the Republican interest, in the country's interest, to get to the bottom of all this. Because it's such a distraction. And certainly the Russians have to be chortling about the success of their efforts to sow dissention in this country.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nSo you feel like your report does not get to the bottom-- you admit your report that you released in January doesn't get to the bottom of this?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nIt did-- well, it got to the bottom of the evidence to the extent of the evidence we had at the time. Whether there is more evidence that's become available since then, whether ongoing investigations will be revelatory, I don't know.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThere was a conclusion that said, \"It's clear that the Russians interfered and did so in an attempt to help Donald Trump.\" Do you still believe that conclusion?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nYes, I do.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBut at this point, what's not proven is the idea of collusion.\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nThat's correct.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWhen you see these parade of officials that were associated with the Trump campaign, first they deny any conversations, now we're hearing more, does that add to suspicion? Or do you think some of this is circumstantial?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nWell, I can't say what the nature of those conversations and dialogues were, for the most part. Again, I'd think it would be very healthy to completely clear the air on this subject. And I think it would be in everyone's interest to have that done.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nCan the Senate Intelligence Committee-- what are we going to learn from their investigation, do you think, that will move beyond what you were able to do?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nWell, I think they can look at this from a broader context than we could. And at this point, I do have confidence in the Senate intelligence Committee and their effort. It is underway, in contrast to the House Intelligence Committee, which just last week agreed on their charter.\n\nAnd importantly, in the case of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this appears to me to be a truly bipartisan effort. And so I think that needs to play out. If, for some reason, that proves not to be satisfactory in the minds of those who make those decisions, then perhaps then move on to a special prosecutor.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThe New York Times, earlier this week, and as I was introducing you, this idea that they sort of left a trail, maybe lowered classif-- can you walk us through how that would work? Did they lower classification levels on certain information? Was that a fair read of what was done in the last few weeks of the administration?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nActually not. Because of the sensitivity of much of the information in this report, our actual effort was to protect it and not to spread it around, and certainly not to dumb it down, if I can use that phrase, in order to disseminate it more widely. We were under a preservation order from both our oversight committees to preserve and protect all the information related to that report, in any event.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nLet me ask you one other final question on the infamous dossier that was put together by this former British operative named Christopher Steele. Why did you feel the need to brief the president on that at the time?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nWe felt that it was important that he know about it, that it was out there. And that, without respect to the veracity of the contents of the dossier, that's why it was not included as a part of our report. Because much of it could not be corroborated. And importantly, some of the sources that Mr. Steele drew on, second and third order assets, we could not validate or corroborate.\n\nSo for that reason, at least in my view, the important thing was to warn the president that this thing was out there. The Russians have a term, an acronym, called Kompromat, which they will either generate, if it's truthful or if it's contrived. And it's important, we felt, that he knew of the existence of this dossier.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHave you done this with other presidents? Have you had to brief them about unverified intelligence?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nYes, I've had occasion in the six and a half years I was DNI to tell President Obama certain things that we could not corroborate or validate, but that we just thought he ought to know it was out there.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right. James Clapper, I have a feeling-- do you expect to have to testify on Capitol Hill among these things?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER:\n\nOh, I don't think there's any doubt.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right. Mr. Clapper, then I have a feeling we will see you on T.V. some time soon. And hopefully you'll come back here on Meet the Press.

Early on Monday morning, Donald Trump tweeted the following ahead of the hearing:\n\nThe real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!\n\nAnd:\n\nWhat about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians?\n\nLater on Monday morning, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that there is an active investigation into the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts.\n\nPretty big news, right? And yet, since that shocking revelation was made, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have asked zeroZERO!questions about that investigation. Instead, theyve focused on leaks, whether journalists publishing leaks have committed a crime ... and if the FBI would investigate the Clinton campaign for ties to Russia. What a coincidence.\n\nQuite clearly, Republicans on this committee are not interested in investigating anything, theyre simply providing cover for Donald Trump. We need a special prosecutor now.\n\n(And by the way, Comey confirmed that there is absolutely no basis for Trumps delusional claims about President Obama wiretapping him.)", "author": "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/20/1645396/-Republicans-at-Comey-hearing-show-why-we-need-a-special-prosecutor-now#view-story", "date": "2017/3/20"}, {"text": "On behalf of the blog ZPolitics, the conservative pollster Clout Research is out with its second survey of the April 18 all-party primary for Georgias 6th Congressional District.
